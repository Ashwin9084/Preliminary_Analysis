Second Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2017-18
Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), Reserve Bank of India
On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at
its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to:
•
keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)
unchanged at 6.25 per cent.

Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 6.0 per cent, and
the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.50 per cent.
The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in
consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price
index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting
growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement
below.
Assessment
2.
Since the April 2017 meeting of the MPC, global economic activity has expanded
at a modest pace, supported by firming growth in major advanced economies (AEs) and
in some emerging market economies (EMEs) as well. In the US, a tightening labour
market is generating wage gains. Alongside, industrial production has steadily improved
in recent months and retail sales remain robust, although home sales ebbed in April.
Political risks remain high, however. In the Euro area, the recovery has been
underpinned by consistently falling unemployment, rising retail sales and a brighter
outlook for manufacturing reflected in purchasing managers’ and business surveys. In
Japan, exports supported by a depreciated yen and industrial activity are driving an
acceleration in growth. Wages and inflation, however, are depressed and holding back
domestic demand. Among EMEs, the Chinese economy is stabilising, especially in
manufacturing, but financial risks in the form of the credit-fuelled debt overhang could
impinge on the outlook. Brazil appears to be emerging out of recession, although growth
dynamics remain fragile due to worsening labour market conditions and political turmoil.
In Russia, the strengthening global environment is supporting the recovery with

1

improving macro fundamentals. South Africa is grappling with structural constraints
which are depressing economic activity.
3.
The pick-up in global merchandise trade volume since the start of the year has
been sustained in Q2 of 2017, buoyed by strengthening global demand as reflected in
rising international air freight and container throughput. Crude prices fell to a five-month
low in early May on higher output from Canada and the US, and remain soft,
undermining the OPEC’s recent efforts to tighten the market by trimming supply. Among
non-fuel commodity prices, metal prices have been retreating on expectations of weak
demand from China. Bullion prices remain range-bound, while food prices eased in April
but rose in May. These developments suggest that the inflation outlook is still relatively
benign for AEs and EMEs alike.
4.
International financial markets have been lifted by improving global growth
prospects, broadly accommodative monetary policy stances of systemic central banks
and generally positive incoming data. Increasingly, financial markets have shown
resilience to geo-political events and have swiftly priced them in. This has been
reflected in the reinvigoration of the reach for returns. Country-specific factors have
modulated investor sentiment. Equity markets in most AEs have gained in Q2,
surpassing past peaks in the US; boosted by corporate profits in Japan; and supported
by easing political tensions and upbeat data in the case of the Euro area. In EMEs,
equities have turned in a mixed performance, with high valuations across Asia, but
weaker in Latin America on softer commodity prices. Bond yields in major AEs have
been largely range-bound. In EMEs, yields have hardened in the few countries facing
inflation pressures and political uncertainties, but for commodity exporters, there has
been some recent decline. In the currency markets, the US dollar has weakened in May
after dovish guidance by the Fed and unexpected political events. Since mid-May, the
yen has shed its depreciating bias and appears to have gained safe haven appeal. EME
currencies, which had depreciated on the strength of the US dollar, have steadied more
recently on renewal of capital flows and risk-on investor appetite.
5.
On May 31, 2017 India’s Central Statistics Office (CSO) released quarterly
estimates of national income accounts for Q4 of 2016-17, provisional estimates for
2016-17 and revisions for the preceding five years. The growth of real gross value
added (GVA) for 2016-17 has been pegged at 6.6 per cent, 0.1 percentage point lower
than the second advance estimates released in February 2017. Underlying the revision
is a downward adjustment in services sector growth in Q4 for the constituents of
construction, financial and professional services, and real estate. Estimates of
agriculture and allied activities have been upgraded to incorporate the all-time high
production of foodgrains and horticulture in the year. GVA in industry has also been
placed higher in the provisional estimates relative to the earlier reading to reflect the
impact of new indices of industrial production (IIP) and wholesale prices (WPI) rebased
to 2011-12. The new data reveal that a slowdown in activity in both industry and
services set in as early as Q1 of 2016-17 and became pronounced in Q4. Moreover, the
deceleration of activity coursing through the year has had underlying drivers that have
been in operation since Q2. Components of aggregate demand reflect a contraction in
gross fixed investment in Q4, reversing the turnaround evident in the second half of the
year in the advance estimates. This is also reflected in the contraction in the production
2

of capital goods in the new IIP. However, private final consumption expenditure
recorded robust year-on-year growth.
6.
On May 9, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) released its third advance estimates
of foodgrains production, which confirmed the record level of output achieved in 201617 and, in fact, revised it upwards to 273 million tonnes. The MoA also set out its
second advance estimates of fruits and vegetables on May 30, which was also a
historical record. Benefiting from the bumper harvest, rabi procurement during Q1 of
2017-18 so far has been significantly higher than a year ago, replenishing food stocks
and taking them to 61.9 million tonnes in May 2017, three times the buffer norm. On
June 6, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) re-affirmed its forecast of a normal
and well-distributed south-west (June-September) monsoon, which augurs well for the
agricultural outlook.
7.
The new series on the IIP released by the CSO on May 12 improves the
coverage of industrial activity, realigns weights and reclassifies sub-sectors to better
capture the underlying structural dynamics of the sector, and smoothens the impact of
lumpy items on the index. As a result, industrial production expanded by 5.0 per cent
during 2016-17 based on the new series (as against 0.7 per cent in the old series).
Turning to the current financial year, the output of eight core industries decelerated
sharply in April on account of contraction in coal, crude oil and cement due to structural
constraints and low demand. Furthermore, electricity generation decelerated due to
depressed demand pricing out relatively expensive thermal output. By contrast, the
production of steel and fertiliser picked up, the former driven up by exports and the latter
by expectations of a normal monsoon.
8.
The business expectations index generated by the Reserve Bank’s April round of
the Industrial Outlook Survey reflects optimism in the manufacturing sector in Q2 of
2017-18, driven by expectations of rising rural demand, exports and profit margins. On
the other hand, the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) moderated
sequentially in May as employment contracted and new orders, both domestic and
exports, slowed down. The index, however, remained in the expansion zone and the
future output index accelerated for the third month in succession.
9.
High frequency real indicators of activity in the services sector point to a mixed
performance in April. In the transportation sub-sector, freight carriage by air and rail
gathered momentum, and passenger car sales accelerated on the back of sustained
strength of urban demand. Sales of commercial vehicles and three-wheelers contracted,
however, reflecting in part the effects of new emission norms and technology changes.
Two-wheeler sales remained depressed, indicative of still subdued rural demand. In the
communication sub-sector, there was a strong growth in the subscriber base of voice
and data services. The sustained growth of foreign tourist arrivals and air passenger
traffic, both domestic and international, supported activity in the hotels, restaurants and
the hospitality sub-sector. Both steel consumption and cement production were,
however, sluggish, pointing to continuing weakness in construction activity. The
services PMI for May rose to its highest reading since November 2016, with an
expansion in new business reflecting improving underlying demand conditions,
alongside optimism on employment.

10.
Retail inflation measured by year-on-year changes in the consumer price index
(CPI) plunged to a historic low in April, pulled down by a large favourable base effect
which overwhelmed a momentum that was feeble relative to the historical record for the
month. Underlying this surprising softness was a sharp fall in food inflation brought
about by a deflation in the prices of pulses and vegetables. In addition, moderation in
the prices of cereals, eggs, oils and fats and spices contributed to the loss of
momentum. In the case of pulses, the large-scale augmentation of supply on account of
expansion in acreage, procurement, buffer stocking and imports caused a sharp decline
in prices starting in August 2016. Propelled by significantly higher arrivals in mandis
relative to the seasonal pattern, prices of vegetables also fell markedly from July and
bottomed out in January 2017, with fire sales during the demonetisation period
accentuating the fall. The seasonal uptick that typically occurs in the pre-monsoon
months has been muted so far. In the fuel group by contrast, inflation surged across the
board. Prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene rose in sympathy with
international prices even as the subsidy was set on a path of calibrated reduction. Fuel
used by rural households rose for the third month in succession, narrowing the wedge
between fuel inflation facing rural and urban households. In response to these
developments, inflation expectations three months ahead and a year ahead surveyed in
the Reserve Bank’s inflation expectations survey of households have ticked down
marginally.
11.
Excluding food and fuel, inflation dipped 60 basis points from a month ago to 4.4
per cent. The delayed and cumulative downward adjustment of domestic petrol and
diesel prices in April to the softening of international crude prices in preceding months
was among the factors at work. Inflation in respect of services embedded in transport
and communication, education, recreation and health also moderated. The industrial
outlook survey and the PMIs for manufacturing and services indicate that pricing power
remains weak.
12.
Even as surplus liquidity in the banking system post-demonetisation was drained
by the ramping up of new currency in circulation by ` 1.5 trillion in April and May,
massive spending by the Government re-injected liquidity into the system, raising the
daily average overall surplus liquidity in the banking system to ` 4.2 trillion in April and `
3.5 trillion in May. Unwinding of the excess reserves that banks used to dress up
balance sheets for end-March also resulted in an accretion of ` 0.8 trillion to the surplus
liquidity. Absorption operations undertaken by the Reserve Bank in the context of these
developments and the consequent downward pressure on money market rates
consisted of ` 1 trillion impounded through issuance of treasury bills (TBs) of tenors
ranging from 312 days to 329 days under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS),
auctions of cash management bills (CMBs) of ` 0.7 trillion triggered by the decline in
cash balances of the Government, and variable rate reverse repo auctions of different
tenors which took in the remaining surplus liquidity averaging ` 3.8 trillion in April and `
3.4 trillion in May. With the narrowing of the the LAF corridor from +/- 50 bps to +/- 25
bps in April 2017, these operations ensured that the weighted average call money rate
(WACR) – the operating target of monetary policy– broadly traded within the corridor.
The spread between the WACR and the policy repo rate narrowed from 29-32 basis
points (bps) in March-April to 21 bps in May.

13.
Merchandise exports posted double digit growth in March and April 2017 in an
environment of slowly improving global trade, with 80 per cent of this expansion
contributed by engineering goods, petroleum products, gems and jewellery, readymade
garments and chemicals. Merchandise imports also increased sharply, propelled by
domestic demand, with the jump of 47.2 per cent in US dollar terms not recorded since
2011. Imports of petroleum and products rose strongly on price effects as international
crude prices firmed up in the wake of OPEC’s productions cut. Gold imports also surged
in volume terms, initially driven by seasonal and festival demand but subsequently by
stockpiling in anticipation of the roll out of the goods and services tax (GST). Non-oil
non-gold imports contributed about half of the total import growth in March and April,
reflecting higher recourse to electronic goods, pearls and precious stones, coal,
machinery and machine tools from overseas markets. With import growth significantly
outpacing export growth, the trade deficit increased sizably. The current account deficit
(CAD) for the year 2016-17 is likely to remain within 1 per cent of GDP. Unlike in the
immediately preceding quarter, capital flows in April-May 2017 were dominated by
foreign portfolio investment (FPI), pushed out by risk-on investor sentiment as global
growth prospects improved. Also, clarity emerged on taxation issues in the Union
Budget and the expectations of faster structural reforms were fuelled by the decisive
outcome of State elections. The level of foreign exchange reserves as on June 2, 2017
was US$ 381.2 billion.
Outlook
14.
The abrupt and significant retreat of inflation in April from the firming trajectory
that was developing in February and March has raised several issues that have to be
factored into the inflation projections. First, it needs to be assessed as to whether or not
the unusually low momentum in the reading for April will endure. Second, the prices of
pulses are clearly reeling under the impact of a supply glut caused by record output and
imports. Policy interventions, including access to open trade, may be envisaged to
arrest the slump in prices. Third, the accumulated downward adjustment in the prices of
petrol and diesel effected in April has been largely reversed on June 1. Fourth, the
easing of inflation excluding food and fuel may be transient in view of its underlying
stickiness in a situation of rising rural wage growth and strong consumption demand.
Thus, the April reading has imparted considerable uncertainty to the evolving inflation
trajectory, especially for the near months. If the configurations evident in April are
sustained, then absent policy interventions, headline inflation is projected in the range of
2.0-3.5 per cent in the first half of the year and 3.5-4.5 per cent in the second half (Chart
1). Risks are evenly balanced, although the spatial and temporal distribution of the
monsoon and the government staying the course in effective food management will play
a critical role in the evolution of risks. The risk of fiscal slippages, which, by and large,
can entail inflationary spillovers, has risen with the announcements of large farm loan
waivers. At the current juncture, global political and financial risks materialising into
imported inflation and the disbursement of allowances under the 7th central pay
commission’s award are upside risks. The date of implementation of the latter is still not
announced and as such, it is not factored into the baseline projections. The
implementation of the GST is not expected to have a material impact on overall inflation.

5

15.
With the CSO’s provisional estimates for 2016-17, the projection of real GVA
growth for 2017-18 has accordingly been revised 10 bps downwards from the April 2017
projection to 7.3 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). The continuing
remonetisation should enable a pick-up in discretionary consumer spending, especially
in cash-intensive segments of the economy. Furthermore, the reductions in banks’
lending rates post-demonetisation should support both consumption and investment
demand of households and stress-free corporates. Moreover, Government spending
continues to be robust, cushioning the impact of a slowdown in other constituents. The
implementation of proposals in the Union Budget should crowd in private investment as
the business environment improves with structural reforms, including the GST, the
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the abolition of the Foreign Investment Promotion
Board. Strengthening external demand will likely play a more decisive role in supporting
the domestic economy. In addition, the new IIP broadens the recognition of industrial
activity. On the downside, global political risks remain elevated and could materialise.
Second, rising input costs and wage pressures may prove a drag on the profitability of
firms, pulling down overall GVA growth. Third, the twin balance sheet problem - overleveraged corporate sector and stressed banking sector - may delay the revival in
private investment demand.

16.
The MPC noted that incoming data suggest that the transitory effects of
demonetisation have lingered on in price formations relating to salient food items,
entangled with excess supply conditions with respect to fruits and vegetables, pulses
and cereals. At the same time, however, the CSO’s latest releases on national income
accounts and industrial production attest to the effects of demonetisation on the broader
economy being sector specific and transient, as well as to the noteworthy resilience of
private consumption. At this stage, it is difficult to isolate these factors or to judge the
6

strength of their persistence. As the year progresses, underlying inflation pressures,
especially input costs, wages and imported inflation, will have to be closely and
continuously monitored.
17.
Noting that inflation has fallen below 4 per cent only since November 2016, the
MPC remains focused on its commitment to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per
cent on a durable basis keeping in mind the output gap. The current state of the
economy underscores the need to revive private investment, restore banking sector
health and remove infrastructural bottlenecks. Monetary policy can play a more effective
role only when these factors are in place. Premature action at this stage risks disruptive
policy reversals later and the loss of credibility. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep
the policy rate unchanged with a neutral stance and remain watchful of incoming data.
18.
The Reserve Bank will continue to work in partnership with the government to
address the stress in banks’ balance sheets. Better alignment of administered interest
rates on small savings with market rates and stepped-up recapitalisation of banks to
facilitate adequate flow of credit to productive sectors are important steps to follow
through.
19.
Five members were in favour of the monetary policy decision, while Dr. Ravindra
H. Dholakia was not in favour. The minutes of the MPC’s meeting will be published by
June 21, 2017.
20.

The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on August 1 and 2, 2017.
