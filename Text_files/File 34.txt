Reserve Bank of India
First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2010-11
By
Dr. D. Subbarao
Governor

Introduction
This First Quarter Review
is being made in a macroeconomic
environment that has changed
significantly since our April policy
announcement. At that time, there was
some optimism about the sustainability of
the global recovery, however modest the
pace may be. This was reinforced by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
forecasts published earlier this month,
which suggested that global growth would
be marginally higher than their April 2010
projection. While most of that would come
from emerging market economies (EMEs),
the advanced economies would hold
steady. However, in the aftermath of the
Greek sovereign debt crisis and other
visible soft spots in Europe and the US,
there is renewed uncertainty about the
sustainability of the recovery.
2.
In contrast, on the domestic front,
the recovery has consolidated and is
becoming increasingly broad-based. There
are rising concerns about capacity
constraints being reached over a wide
range of sectors. While inflationary
pressures have also risen, the performance
of the monsoon so far has been
significantly better than during last year.
While rainfall is still below the long

period average at the all-India level, it has
been enough to induce a significant
increase in sown area across a range of
crops, the high prices of which have been
a source of great worry.
3.
The dominant concern that has
shaped the monetary policy stance in this
review is high inflation. Even as food
price inflation and, more generally,
consumer price inflation have shown some
moderation, they are still in double digits.
Non-food inflation has risen and demand
side pressures are clearly evident. With
growth taking firm hold, the balance of
policy stance has to shift decisively to
containing inflation and anchoring
inflationary expectations.
4.
This policy review should be read
and understood together with the detailed
review in Macroeconomic and Monetary
Developments released yesterday by
the Reserve Bank. This statement is
organised in four sections: Section I
provides an overview of the global and
domestic macroeconomic developments;
Section II sets out the outlook and
projections for growth, inflation and
monetary aggregates; Section III explains
the stance of monetary policy; and Section
IV specifies the monetary measures.

I. The State of the Economy
8.
Inflation in advanced economies is
subdued due to large output gaps and
high unemployment rates. Inflation
expectations also remain well anchored.
In contrast, inflation in EMEs has been
rising due to fast emerging capacity
constraints, prompting many to reverse
their expansionary monetary policies.

Global Economy
5.
In its July Update of the
World Economic Outlook (WEO), the
IMF raised its global growth projection
for 2010 to 4.6 per cent from its April
projection of 4.2 per cent on the strength
of Q1 growth rates. However, the IMFâ€™s
expectation of slightly faster global
growth is largely driven by somewhat
greater optimism about EMEs. Several
assessments of advanced economies show
increasing pessimism about the
sustainability of the current pace of
recovery. There is widespread expectation
of a slowdown of the global economy in
the second half of 2010.

Domestic Economy
9.
The Indian economy grew by
7.4 per cent in 2009-10. The momentum
was particularly pronounced in Q4 of
2009-10 with growth at 8.6 per cent as
compared with 6.5 per cent in the previous
quarter. At constant market prices, the
pick-up in Q4 growth was even sharper at
11.2 per cent, reflecting a significant
turnaround in indirect tax collections.

6.
In the US, recovery remains
constrained by high unemployment,
modest income growth, lower housing
wealth and tight credit. In the euro area,
economic activity is weak, though more
resilient than expected in the face of the
recent turbulence. The growth outlook
remains clouded by concerns about the
sustainability of sovereign debt in some
of the euro area economies.

10.
The double digit growth in the
Index of Industrial Production (IIP) that
began in October 2009 continued during
the current financial year although there
was modest deceleration in May 2010.
In the first two months of this fiscal,
April-May 2010, the IIP recorded a
year-on-year growth of 14 per cent with
as many as fifteen out of the seventeen
industry groups (two digits NIC
classification) showing positive growth.
The lead indicators of service sector also
suggest increased economic activity.

7.
In contrast, EMEs are witnessing
strong growth, driven by strong domestic
demand, restocking of inventories
and, thus far, recovering global trade.
In many EMEs, especially in Asia,
growth is fast approaching the trend.
Robust macroeconomic fundamentals,
unimpaired balance sheets of corporates
and households, sound banking sector and
effective fiscal and monetary stimuli
contributed to a significantly faster
recovery in EMEs.

11.
The cumulative rainfall has been
14 per cent below its long-period average
(LPA) during the current monsoon season
so far (as on July 21, 2010). Even so,
monsoon performance has been much
better than it was last year, which augurs
well for agricultural production. Data on
2

14.
Money supply (M 3 ) growth on
a year-on-year basis moderated from
16.8 per cent at end-March 2010 to
15.3 per cent as on July 2, 2010 reflecting
a slowdown in the growth in bank
deposits. Time deposits decelerated
mainly because of withdrawal of deposits
by public sector undertakings and mutual
funds. In order to finance higher credit
growth in the face of declining deposit
growth, banks unwound their investments
in mutual funds and accessed the repo
window of the Reserve Bank.

crop-wise area indicate a significant
increase over the relatively low levels of
last year.
12.
However, the current inflation
scenario is worrisome for a number of
reasons. First, WPI inflation has been in
double digits since February 2010.
Headline inflation, as measured
by year-on-year variation in WPI, rose
to 10.6 per cent in June 2010, up from
10.2 per cent in May 2010. Notably, WPI
inflation based on revised data for
March at 11.0 per cent and for April at
11.2 per cent, were higher by over one
percentage point as compared with the
provisional numbers. If this pattern
continues, final WPI inflation numbers for
recent months can be expected to be
higher.

15.
Year-on-year non-food credit
growth accelerated from 17.1 per cent in
March 2010 to 22.3 per cent as on July 2,
2010, which was higher than the indicative
trajectory of 20 per cent set out in the April
2010 Monetary Policy Statement. This
reflects the combined impact of a pick-up
in industrial activity and financing of the
3G and broadband wireless access (BWA)
spectrum auctions. The increase in bank
credit to the commercial sector has also
been supplemented by higher flow of
funds from other sources. Rough estimates
show that the total flow of financial
resources from banks, non-banks and
external sources to the commercial sector
during Q1 of 2010-11 was at Rs.2,50,000
crore as against Rs.61,000 crore during
Q1 of 2009-10. Disaggregated data
suggest that credit growth to all major
sectors such as agriculture, industry,
services and personal loans had begun to
improve from November 2009 onwards.

13.
Second, even as primary food
articles inflation continues to be in double
digits (14.6 per cent), year-on-year WPI
non-food manufactured products
(weight: 52.2 per cent) inflation, which
was (-) 0.4 per cent in November 2009,
rose sharply thereafter to 5.4 per cent in
March 2010 and further to 7.3 per cent
in June 2010. Non-food items inflation
(WPI excluding food products and
food articles), which was near zero
in November 2009, rose sharply to
10.6 per cent by June 2010. Significantly,
non-food items contributed over
70 per cent to WPI inflation in June 2010,
suggesting that inflation is now
very much generalised. Third,
notwithstanding some moderation in
recent months, consumer price inflation,
measured by various indices, remains in
double digits.

16.
On the deposit side, banks
increased their term deposit rates by
75-100 basis points between March 2010
and July 16, 2010. On the lending
side, benchmark prime lending rates
3

(BPLRs) of scheduled commercial banks
remained unchanged from July 2009 till
end-June 2010. The banking system
switched over to the Base Rate system
with effect from July 1, 2010. The Base
Rates set by major banks are in the range
of 7.25-8.0 per cent. While information
on effective lending rates to major
categories of borrowers is not yet
available, it is expected that the Base Rate
system will make credit pricing more
efficient. Further, it will enhance
transparency in lending rates and improve
monetary policy transmission.

to July 16, 2010, the SLAF remains
extended up to July 30, 2010. Second, in
consultation with the Government, the
notified amounts for the issuance of
Treasury Bills during June 2010 were
reduced by Rs.22,000 crore. Third, during
June 16-21, 2010, the Government bought
back securities worth Rs.9,614 crore,
ahead of schedule.
19.
There was net injection of
liquidity by the Reserve Bank in June and
July 2010 (up to July 23). As a result,
overnight interest rates, which generally
remained around the floor of the LAF
corridor up to May, moved up to the
ceiling of the corridor in June 2010 and
have remained there in July 2010 so far.
Similarly, yields on other money market
instruments increased, reflecting
autonomous tightening of monetary
conditions by 150 basis points, equivalent
to the prevailing width of the LAF
corridor.

17.
Money markets remained orderly
during Q1 of 2010-11. A significant
development was that the Liquidity
Adjustment Facility (LAF) window of the
Reserve Bank, after remaining in surplus
mode for nearly 18 months, switched into
deficit mode towards the end of May 2010
and has remained there since. This
liquidity pressure was triggered by the
increase in government cash balances on
account of larger than expected 3G and
BWA spectrum auction receipts combined
with advance tax payments.

20.
At the longer end of the market,
the monthly average yield on the 10-year
benchmark government security fell
to 7.59 per cent in June 2010 from
8.01 per cent in April 2010 in the
expectation that the Government will
reduce market borrowing because of
higher realisations from spectrum
auctions. Subsequently, the yield moved
up to 7.73 per cent by the third week of
July 2010.

18.
Consistent with the stance of
active liquidity management and in order
to prevent a disruption in credit flow, the
Reserve Bank took several measures to
ease the pressure. First, on May 26, 2010,
the Reserve Bank announced additional
liquidity support under the LAF to
scheduled commercial banks to the extent
of up to 0.5 per cent of their net demand
and time liabilities (NDTL). A second
LAF (SLAF) was also made available on
a daily basis. Both these facilities, which
were initially available till July 2, 2010,
were later extended. While the additional
liquidity support facility was extended up

21.
Equity markets exhibited volatile
conditions during the current financial
year, although they have firmed up in
recent weeks. Resource mobilisation by
the corporates through public issues in the
primary segment of the capital market
continued its uptrend. The foreign
4

exchange market saw volatility increase
relative to the previous quarter, with
the rupee showing two-way movements
in the range of Rs.44.33-Rs.47.57 per
US dollar.

38.5 per cent (Rs.1,32,900 crore) of the
borrowing was completed by mid-July
2010. As against the budgeted amount of
Rs 35,000 crore, the actual realisations
under 3G and BWA auctions were about
Rs. 1,06,000 crore, resulting in an increase
in receipts by over one per cent of GDP.
It is, however, important to ensure that this
one-off increase does not slacken the
much needed efforts towards fiscal
consolidation.

22.
During the first quarter of
2010-11, both the nominal and real
effective exchange rates (NEER and
REER) have appreciated. While the
appreciation in 36-currency NEER/REER
at about 1.5 per cent (up to May) was
similar, real appreciation on the basis of
6-currency REER was higher at 3.3 per
cent as compared with 6-currency NEER
appreciation of 1.4 per cent, reflecting
higher inflation differentials between
India and major advanced economies.

24.
During the first two months of
2010-11, both exports and imports
continued to expand in contrast to the
contraction they showed during the
corresponding period of last year. The
trade deficit widened during April-May
2010 to US$ 21.7 billion, up from
US$ 14.4 billion in the corresponding
period of the previous year, reflecting the
sustained increase in domestic activity.

23.
Of the budgeted net market
borrowing of the Central Government for
2010-11 at Rs. 3,45,010 crore, about

II. Outlook and Projections
inflation scenario in advanced economies
has been shaped by high unemployment,
low capacity utilisation and renewed
uncertainties about the financial sector.
Headline inflation in advanced economies,
which inched up during January-March
2010, softened thereafter. Inflation
expectations too remain well anchored;
indeed, concerns about deflation have
re-emerged in some of the advanced
economies. In contrast, the relatively rapid
recovery in EMEs has also been
accompanied by faster growth in prices.

Global Outlook
Growth
25.
In its July Update of the World
Economic Outlook, the IMF revised
upwards its growth projection for the
global economy for 2010 to 4.6 per cent
from 4.2 per cent in April 2010 on the
strength of robust Q1 growth. However,
as indicated earlier, recent data and
analysis suggest slowing down of the
global growth momentum and the
expectation is that global growth in the
second half of 2010 will be lower than that
in the first half.

27.
Significantly, with increasing
uncertainty about the pace of global
recovery, global energy and commodity
prices have softened. This trend has
been reinforced by the slowdown of the

Just like growth, inflation around
the world too has been multi-speed. The

improvements.

Chinese economy. Consequently, global
inflationary pressures are expected to be
subdued over the next few months.

30.
The strength of the recovery is
also reflected in the sales and profitability
growth of the corporate sector. Besides
replenishment of inventories, investment
intentions are being translated into action
across sectors, particularly in power,
telecom and metals. Increase in resource
mobilisation by the commercial sector
from both banks and non-banks and the
widening of the current account deficit
also suggest strong underlying growth
momentum.

Domestic Outlook
Growth
28.
The growth prospects of the Indian
economy have improved since April
2010. Although cumulative rainfall so far
has been 14 per cent below the LPA, the
monsoon has been better than during
last year. Should overall monsoon
performance turn out to be as projected
(102 per cent of LPA), there will be a
pick-up in rural demand. This should
give further momentum to the
performance of the industrial sector,
which has been growing firmly since
October 2009.

31.
Domestic drivers of growth are
robust. However, if the global recovery
slows down, it will affect all EMEs,
including India, through the usual exports,
financing and confidence channels.

29.
Growth in exports, which turned
positive in October 2009, picked up
further in subsequent months despite
concerns over the external demand
outlook due to the sovereign debt problem
in euro area. Service sector activities have
also shown buoyancy since the latter half
of 2009-10. The leading indicators of

32.
Taking into account the progress
of monsoon so far and the prevailing
global macroeconomic scenario, for
policy purposes, the baseline projection
of real GDP growth for 2010-11 is revised
to 8.5 per cent, up from 8.0 per cent with
an upside bias as indicated in April 2010
policy statement (Chart 1). This upward

revision is primarily based on better
industrial production and its favourable
impact on the services sector, giving due
consideration to the global scenario.

36.
Minimum support prices (MSPs)
for some agricultural commodities have
also been increased to incentivise farmers.
Food price inflation has remained at an
elevated level for over a year now,
reflecting structural bottlenecks in certain
commodities such as pulses, milk and
vegetables. The Reserve Bankâ€™s quarterly
inflation expectation survey conducted
during the first fortnight of June 2010
indicates that short-term inflationary
expectations have increased marginally.

33.
The Reserve Bankâ€™s growth
projection for 2010-11 is consistent with
the median growth forecast from its
professional forecastersâ€™ survey and other
agencies. It must be noted that the IMF
growth forecast for India at 9.4 per cent
for calendar 2010 is based on GDP at
market prices, whereas other projections,
including that of the Reserve Bank, are
based on GDP at factor cost. Adjusting for
this, the IMF projections are in line with
others.

37.
Going forward, the outlook on
inflation will be shaped by the following
factors. First, the spatial and temporal
distribution of rainfall in the remaining
period of south-west monsoon 2010 is
critical. A good kharif harvest will act as
a major dampener on short-term food price
inflation. Second, global energy and
commodity prices have been showing
distinct signs of softening over the past
few weeks as expectations of global
growth have moderated. If energy prices
continue to decline, this will offset the
inflationary impact of the recent fuel price
hike. Further, idle global capacity in a
range of sectors will allow competitive
imports to reduce the momentum in
domestic prices. Third, consequent on the
strengthening of domestic growth drivers,
demand-side pressures are building up.

Inflation
34.
WPI inflation moved to double
digits in February 2010 and has remained
there since then. Even as food price
inflation and consumer price inflation
remain at elevated levels, inflation is now
being significantly driven by demand side
factors.
35.
In its policy statement of April
2010, the Reserve Bank had placed the
baseline projection for WPI inflation for
March 2011 at 5.5 per cent. Subsequently,
there has been an increase in prices of
many administered/regulated items
such as petroleum products, iron ore and
electricity. The recent partial deregulation
and increase in administered prices of
petroleum products is welcome from the
long-term fiscal consolidation and energy
conservation perspective. Nevertheless, it
will have an inflationary impact in the
short term. Assuming that global crude oil
prices remain stable, the immediate
impact on inflation will be about one

38.
Taking into account the emerging
domestic and external scenario, the
baseline projection for WPI inflation for
March 2011 has been raised to 6.0 per cent
from 5.5 per cent as indicated in the
April policy statement (Chart 2).

39.
The Reserve Bank will endeavour
to achieve price stability and anchor
inflation expectations. In pursuit of these
objectives, the Reserve Bank will continue
to evaluate an array of aggregate and
disaggregated measures of inflation in the
context of the evolving macroeconomic
situation.

Monetary Aggregates
41.
While the current year-on-year
money supply (M3) growth at 15.3 per cent
is below the indicative projection of
17.0 per cent, non-food credit growth at
22.3 per cent was marginally higher than
the indicative projection of 20.0 per cent.
It is expected that even with the higher
growth projection, monetary aggregates
will evolve along the projected trajectory
indicated in the April policy statement.
Accordingly, the M3 and non-food credit
growth projections for 2010-11 have been
retained at 17 per cent and 20 per cent
respectively. As always, these numbers are
indicative projections and not targets.

40.
Notwithstanding the current
inflation scenario, it is important
to recognise that in the last decade
(2000-01 to 2009-10), the average
inflation rate, measured both in terms
of WPI and CPI, moderated to around
5 per cent from the historical trend rate
of about 7.5 per cent. A combination
of factors played a role in this
transformation. One of these was a
monetary policy committed to keeping
inflation low and stable. This record is an
important foundation for the credibility of
monetary policy and, more generally, the
broader inflation management framework.
Against this backdrop, the conduct of
monetary policy will continue to condition
and contain perception of inflation in the
range of 4.0-4.5 per cent. This will be in
line with the medium-term objective of

Risk Factors
42.
The above macroeconomic and
monetary projections are subject to a
number of upside and downside risks.
43.
The main risk emanates from the
global scenario and has two key
dimensions. First, if the global recovery
8

state of global economy, central banks in
advanced economies are likely to maintain
accommodative monetary policies for an
extended period. With the strong growth
potential of EMEs, including India, this
is likely to trigger large capital inflows.
Large capital inflows above the absorptive
capacity of the economy will pose
a challenge for monetary and exchange
rate management. This also has
implications for asset prices. In this
scenario, a widening current account
deficit will help absorb a larger proportion
of the inflows.

falters, the risk of which has
increased since the April 2010 policy
announcement, the performance of EMEs
is likely to be adversely affected. While
Indiaâ€™s trade linkages with the advanced
economies are appreciably smaller than
those of other major EMEs, a widespread
slowdown in global trade will have an
impact on important manufacturing and
service sectors.
44.
The more significant risk, though,
is from a potential slowdown in capital
inflows. Indiaâ€™s rapid recovery has
resulted in a widening of the current
account deficit, as imports have grown
faster than exports. Even if exports slow
down, the strength of domestic growth
drivers will keep imports buoyant,
suggesting a widening of the trade deficit.
However, in the face of a global
slowdown, increasing risk aversion
amongst global investors may
significantly reduce the flow of capital
into EMEs, including India. Apart from
narrowing the comfortable buffer between
the current account deficit and net capital
inflows, this may constrain domestic
investment, which is critical to achieving
and sustaining high growth rates.

46.
On the inflation front, the
prospects of softening of domestic
inflation around mid-year 2010-11 are
contingent on moderating food prices.
Rainfall has been generally adequate so
far, indicating good prospects for the
agricultural sector. But, with two months
yet to go for the season, the risk of
inadequate rainfall adversely affecting
specific regions and crops remains.
47.
However, with respect to
controlling inflation, the global scenario
may generate some favourable impulses.
Slower global growth will help lower
energy and commodity prices. Unutilised
global capacity in many sectors will also
ease pressure on prices.

45.
Admittedly, the risk of capital
flows runs both ways. Given the present

III. The Policy Stance
48.
Since October 2009, when it
signalled the reversal of its policy stance,
the Reserve Bank has cumulatively raised
the CRR by 100 basis points and the repo
and reverse repo rates under the LAF by
75 basis points each. The monetary policy
response has been calibrated on the basis

of Indiaâ€™s specific growth-inflation
dynamics in the broader context of
persistent global uncertainty.
49.
Thus, our policy stance for
2010-11 has been conditioned by three
major considerations:
9

50.
First, domestic economic recovery
is firmly in place and is strengthening. The
7.4 per cent growth in 2009-10 despite
weak global growth and the insignificant
contribution of the agriculture sector is a
testimony of the resilience of the Indian
economy. The Reserve Bankâ€™s upward
revision of the GDP growth projection for
2010-11 to 8.5 per cent (from 8.0 per cent
with an upside bias in April 2010) indicates
that the economy is steadily reverting to
its pre-crisis growth trajectory. However,
even as this is happening, prospects of a
sustained global recovery appear to be
increasingly uncertain, with possible
adverse consequences for the EMEs,
including India.

and inflation scenario, while taking care
not to disrupt the recovery.
53.
In this consideration, the liquidity
situation plays a crucial role. It is well
understood that transmission of monetary
policy through rate actions works most
effectively when liquidity is being
injected into the financial system by the
central bank, rather than when it is being
absorbed. Our calibrated actions to absorb
surplus liquidity from October 2009
onwards were reinforced by market
conditions, which evolved in early June
2010 and still persist. Consequently,
overnight call money interest rates have
moved towards the upper bound of the
LAF corridor, which is equivalent to
effective tightening of rates by 150 basis
points. This has also brought the system
closer to a point at which policy rate
actions are likely to have greater traction.

51.
Second, inflationary pressures
have exacerbated and become generalised,
with demand-side pressures clearly
evident. Capacity constraints are visible
in several sectors and pricing power is
returning to producers. Inflationary
expectations also remain at an elevated
level. Given the spread and persistence of
inflation, demand-side inflationary
pressures need to be contained.

54.
Current market conditions indicate
that while liquidity pressures will ease, the
system is likely to remain in deficit mode
for now. This implies a significant change
in the monetary operations, which has a
direct bearing on our actions. In a deficit
liquidity mode, the repo rate under the
LAF has emerged as the operating policy
rate. The LAF operates in such a manner
that as systemic liquidity alternates from
surplus to deficit, even at the margin, the
overnight call money rates alternate
between the reverse repo rate and the repo
rate. This imparts volatility to call rates
to the extent of the width of the LAF
corridor.

52.
Third, despite the increase in the
policy rates by 75 basis points
cumulatively, real policy rates are not
consistent with the strong growth that
the economy is now witnessing. As
articulated in previous policy statements/
reviews, lower policy rates can complicate
the inflation outlook and impair
inflationary expectations, particularly
given the increased generalisation of
inflation. It is, therefore, imperative that
we continue in the direction of
normalising our policy instruments to a
level consistent with the evolving growth

55.
There is no unique way to
determine the appropriate width of the
policy interest rate corridor. But the
10

guiding principles are: (i) it should be
broad enough not to unduly incentivise
market participants to place their surplus
funds with the central bank; (ii) it should
not be so broad that it gives scope for
greater interest rate volatility to distort the
policy signal. The challenge, therefore, is
to strike the right balance.

a quarter. In a rapidly evolving
macroeconomic situation, however, a gap
of a quarter between policy reviews can
be too long. In recent years, there have
been several occasions (April, June and
September-December 2008; January and
March 2009; and March and July 2010)
when the Reserve Bank had to take offcycle policy actions in response to
macroeconomic developments. While
these instances challenge the discipline of
the quarterly schedule, they also
underscore the need for flexibility to
manoeuvre. Many major central banks in
the world make monetary policy
announcements more frequently ranging
generally from 8 to 12 announcements in
a year. It is, therefore, proposed to
formalise what is already an informal,
internal process.

56.
As the systemic liquidity transits
from an uni-directional surplus mode to
a bi-directional mode, it will have
implications for the effectiveness of
monetary transmission. In the context of
the changing liquidity dynamics, the
operation of the LAF needs to be studied.
Accordingly, it is proposed to set up a
Working Group to review the current
operating procedure of monetary policy of
the Reserve Bank, including the LAF.
57.
Against the above stated backdrop,
the stance of monetary policy is intended
to:
âˆ‘

Contain inflation and anchor
inflationary expectations, while being
prepared to respond to any further
build-up of inflationary pressures.

âˆ‘

Maintain an interest rate regime
consistent with price, output and
financial stability.

âˆ‘

Actively manage liquidity to ensure
that it remains broadly in balance so
that excess liquidity does not dilute
the effectiveness of policy rate
actions.

59.
Accordingly, the Reserve Bank
will now undertake mid-quarter reviews
roughly at the interval of about one and
half months after each quarterly review.
As per schedule, mid-quarter reviews will
be in June, September, December and
March. They will be by way of a press
release, which will provide a rationale
for either action or maintenance of the
status quo.
60.
Mid-quarter Reviews are intended
to communicate our assessment of
economic conditions more frequently. By
instituting these, it is our intention to take
the surprise element out of the off-cycle
actions. However, the Reserve Bank will
have the flexibility, as always, to take
swift and pre-emptive policy action, as
and when warranted by the evolving
macroeconomic developments.
