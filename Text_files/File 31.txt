Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2009-10
By
Dr. D. Subbarao
Governor
The global economy has begun to
recover from the deep recession set off by
the financial crisis. This recovery is
underpinned by output expansion in
emerging market economies (EMEs),
particularly those in Asia. The pace and shape
of recovery, however, remain uncertain.
2.
In fact, the global economic outlook
presents a mixed picture. On the positive
side, world output, as per the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates, has
expanded by 3 per cent in the second
quarter (quarter-on-quarter, annualised),
manufacturing activity has picked up, trade
is recovering, financial market conditions are
improving, and risk appetite is returning. A
sharp recovery in equity markets has enabled
banks to raise capital to repair their balance
sheets. In the US, home prices appear to be
stabilising. Capital flows to EMEs have
resumed. Most importantly, the anxiety and
nervousness that pervaded the financial
markets during the height of the crisis are
being replaced by a sense of calm.
3.
On the negative side, there are
concerns that the recovery is fragile. The
second quarter improvement is essentially
the outcome of policy-induced stimulus.
Going forward, the impact of the stimulus
will fade away and inventory rebuilding may
lose momentum. In advanced economies,
private consumption remains constrained by

continuing job losses, sluggish income
growth and dented confidence. Even as
output is recovering, unemployment is
expected to increase to over 10 per cent in
the US and the Euro area. Investment is also
expected to remain weak due to ruptured
balances sheets, excess capacity and
financing constraints. Bank collapses are
continuing. World trade remains below its
year ago level, notwithstanding recent
quarter-on-quarter improvement.
4.
Reflecting this mixed trend which
has a small bias towards the positive, the
IMF projected, in its October 2009 World
Economic Outlook (WEO), that the rate of
contraction of the world economy in 2009
will be 1.1 per cent, an upward revision from
its projection of a contraction of 1.4 per cent
made in its July 2009 WEO. However, the
IMF expects the ensuing global recovery to
be slow. In its latest Economic Outlook
(September 2009), the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) projects the pace of activity to
remain weak well into 2010 on account of
numerous headwinds. On balance, while
global economic prospects have improved
since the First Quarter Review in July 2009,
uncertainties remain about the pace and
sustainability of economic recovery.
5.
The Indian economy, which slowed
down significantly during the second half

7.
This Second Quarter Review of
Monetary Policy for 2009-10 is thus set
against the backdrop of incipient signs of
recovery in the global economy and improving
prospects for the domestic economy. The
Review is organised in two parts. Part
A covers Monetary Policy and is divided
into three sections: Section I provides an
assessment of the Macroeconomic and
Monetary Developments; Section II defines
the Stance of Monetary Policy; and Section
III sets out Monetary Measures. Part B
covers the Developmental and Regulatory
Policies and is organised into seven sections:
Financial Stability (Section I), Interest Rate
Policy (Section II), Financial Markets
(Section III), Credit Delivery Mechanism
and other Banking Services (Section IV),
Financial Inclusion (Section V), Regulatory
Measures for Commercial Banks (Section
VI) and Institutional Developments (Section
VII). Part A of this Statement should be read
and understood together with the detailed
review in Macroeconomic and Monetary
Developments released yesterday.

of 2008-09, largely due to the knock-on
effect of the global financial crisis, has begun
to stabilise. This is despite the continuing
contraction in exports and the worst drought
since 1972. Performance of the industrial
sector has improved markedly in recent
months. Both domestic and external
financing conditions are on the upturn.
Capital inflows have revived. Activity in
the primary capital market has picked up
and funding from non-bank domestic
sources has eased. Liquidity conditions
have remained easy and interest rates have
softened in the money and credit markets.
6.
At the same time, there are several
negative indications. Private consumption
demand is yet to pick up. Agricultural
production is expected to decline due to
lower Kharif foodgrain production.
Services sector growth remains below
trend. Bank credit growth continues to be
sluggish. There are also clear signs of rising
inflation stemming largely from the supply
side, particularly from food prices.

3.1 per cent against the earlier projection
of 2.5 per cent in its July Update (Table 1).

8.
Global economic performance
improved during the second quarter of 2009
prompting the IMF to reduce the projected
rate of economic contraction in 2009
from 1.4 per cent made in July 2009 to 1.1
per cent in its latest World Economic
Outlook (WEO) released in early October
2009. The IMF has also revised upwards

9.
In the US, the macroeconomic
signals are mixed. Real GDP in Q2 of 2009
contracted by 0.7 per cent, a significant
improvement over the contraction of 6.4
per cent in Q1 of 2009, largely due to
positive contribution from government
spending. Home prices have shown signs
of stabilisation. On the negative side, the

Leading Indicators for August 2009 show
signs of recovery in most of the economies,
especially in France and Italy.
Inflation
11.
Global commodity prices have
rebounded ahead of global recovery. The
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
Food Price Index rose in August-September
2009. Along with volatile food prices,
industrial metal and gold prices have firmed
up in Q3 of 2009. Gold prices have reached
record levels on account of significant
weakening of the US dollar during the
quarter. Crude oil prices have been steady
with a firm undertone during the quarter
reflecting the balance of expectations of an
economic recovery and higher oil
consumption in the future against weak
current demand and high inventories.
Despite these trends, consumer price
inflation in most developed and emerging
market economies (other than India) remains
negative/low due mostly to large output
gaps. The WEO of October 2009 projects
consumer price inflation in advanced
countries to remain low, rising from 0.1
per cent in 2009 to 1.1 per cent in 2010.
Consumer price inflation in emerging and
developing economies is projected to decline
from 5.5 per cent in 2009 to 4.9 per cent in
2010. In sharp contrast, in India, CPI
inflation has not only remained elevated, but
has indeed hardened in recent months
reflecting higher food prices (Table 2).

unemployment rate rose to 9.8 per cent in
September 2009 and is expected to rise
further. Consumer sentiment dipped on
apprehensions about the economy, job and
income prospects.
10.
Economic indicators in the euro
area continue to be weak. Real GDP
contracted by 4.9 per cent in Q1 and by 4.8
per cent in Q2 of 2009. Unemployment rose
to 9.6 per cent in August 2009 and retail
sales dipped further. Although consumer
and business confidence improved in
Q3 of 2009, these are yet to move into
positive territory. Real GDP in the UK
contracted by 5.5 per cent in Q2 of 2009
and by 5.2 per cent in Q3 of 2009.
Unemployment in the UK rose to 7.9
per cent in July-August 2009. Real GDP in
Japan expanded by 2.3 per cent in Q2 2009
after negative growth for almost a year.
Though output is stabilising and consumer
and business confidence are improving,
industrial outlook remains uncertain with
big companies planning to cut capital
outlays. Overall, OECD’s Composite

The wide array of supportive central
bank actions and pronouncements have

support to alleviate stress in the financial
markets following the crisis. In the current
cycle, the Reserve Bank of Australia has
been the first G-20 central bank to raise its
policy rate (Cash Rate) by 25 basis points
to 3.25 per cent on October 6 on the back
of diminished risk of serious economic
contraction. The Reserve Bank of New
Zealand has withdrawn some temporary
emergency liquidity facilities put in place
during the financial crisis of 2008.
Emerging Market Economies
14.
In its October WEO, the IMF
projects the real GDP growth of emerging
and developing economies to decelerate to
1.7 per cent in 2009 (1.5 per cent projected
in the July Update) from 6.0 per cent in 2008,
before rebounding to 5.1 per cent in 2010.
The IMF does not expect the rebound to be
evenly spread across the EMEs; there will
be a divergence between Asian and
non-Asian EMEs as the rebound would be
driven by China, India and other emerging
Asian economies. Emerging markets that
had little direct exposure to the financial
meltdown have displayed significant
economic momentum in Q3 of 2009, albeit
slower than the rapid pace of Q2. China’s
export volumes have been growing,
including recently to the US and Europe,
leading to improvement in China’s trade
surplus. Growth in industrial production and
fixed asset investment in China is estimated
to have improved and its longer-term
prospects have remained strong. In contrast,
Latin America, Eastern Europe and
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
are all expected to face contraction in 2009
and sluggish growth in 2010, while the
Middle East is projected to grow moderately.

Share prices have rebounded in all major
markets. Most major banks in the US and
Europe have reported profits recently after
the large losses incurred during 2008. On
the negative side, credit offtake has fallen in
2009 in a number of advanced economies
as corporates reduced debt levels in an
environment of tighter credit standards by
lenders. There are concerns, as highlighted
by the Global Financial Stability Report
(GFSR) of the IMF, that the transfer of
financial risks to fiscal authorities could
crowd out the private sector and undermine
the sustainability of public sector finances.
Monetary Policy Measures
13.
Central banks in all the major
developed economies, barring Australia,
continued with easy monetary policy and
have held policy rates steady in recent
months. They have also continued with
measures to provide liquidity and other
4

it was 17.0 per cent. However, experience
shows that a deficient rainfall can have a
disproportionate impact on overall
economic prospects and on the sense of
well-being. Poor output will push up prices
and depress rural labour incomes. Given the
inter-sectoral supply-demand linkages, the
knock-on impact on the industrial and
services sectors can also be significant. The
large stock of foodgrains of 44.3 million
tonnes with public agencies, improved
supply management, and the social safety
net programmes could mitigate the adverse
effects to an extent.

Domestic Outlook
15.
The Indian economy posted a
growth of 6.1 per cent for Q1 of 2009-10.
This is higher than the expansion of 5.8
per cent in Q4 of 2008-09, but lower than
the expansion of 7.8 per cent in the
corresponding first quarter of 2008-09. The
year-on-year (y-o-y) deceleration in growth
was broad-based covering all the three
major sectors, viz., agriculture, industry and
services (Table 3).
Agriculture
16.
The south-west monsoon rainfall
this year (June 1- September 30) was 23
per cent lower than the long-period average,
the weakest since 1972. Twenty three of the
36 meteorological sub-divisions recorded
deficient rainfall. The entire central and
northern India received deficient rainfall.
The Reserve Bank’s production-weighted
rainfall index for 2009 was 73, significantly
lower than the index number 104 for 2008.
According to the latest information of
progress of Kharif sowing, the acreage
under paddy declined by 15.7 per cent and
that under oilseeds by 5.2 per cent.

Industry
18.
The industrial sector has shown
clear signs of revival in recent months. The
index of industrial production (IIP)
increased at a higher rate of 5.8 per cent
during April-August 2009 as compared
with a growth of 4.8 per cent in the
corresponding period of the previous year
and 0.6 per cent growth in the second half
of 2008-09. While the basic, intermediate
and consumer durable goods sectors
witnessed higher growth, the performance
of the capital goods and consumer
non-durable sectors was relatively modest.
The core infrastructure sector, with a

weight of 26.7 per cent in the IIP, posted a
growth of 4.8 per cent during April-August
2009, up from 3.3 per cent in the
corresponding period of the previous year.
The leading indicators of industrial
production, both quantitative and
qualitative, also point to revival of
industrial activity in the months ahead.

Demand Components of GDP
20.
Continuing the trend witnessed
since Q2 of 2008-09, the two major
components of demand, viz., private final
consumption expenditure and gross fixed
capital formation (with a combined weight
of around 88 per cent) decelerated further in
Q1 of 2009-10. Government consumption,
which had increased sharply in Q3 and Q4
of 2008-09 due to the fiscal stimulus
measures and the Sixth Pay Commission
payouts, also decelerated in Q1 of 2009-10.
While the direct impact of fiscal stimulus is
waning, its indirect impact on private
consumption and investment will persist for
some more time. External demand
continues to remain weak, whereas net
exports turned positive in Q1 of 2009-10
because of a sharper decline in imports
than in exports as compared with Q1 of
2008-09 (Table 4).

Services
19.
The performance of the services
sector during April-July 2009 continued to
follow the pattern witnessed in Q4 of
2008-09. Trade-related services such as
cargo handled at major sea and airports
continued to show deceleration/negative
growth reflecting contraction of trade. The
number of passengers handled at
international terminals increased, albeit
marginally, while the number of passengers
handled at domestic terminals declined.
Other domestic activity related services
such as communication and construction
have begun to show signs of upturn. The

The latest round of the survey conducted
during July-August 2009 showed a
turnaround in the business sentiment. The
assessment for Q2 of 2009-10 showed
continuing upturn with a 7.8 per cent
increase in the Business Expectations Index
(BEI) over the previous quarter.
Considerable improvement was noted in key
indicators such as production, order books
and capacity utilisation. The financing
conditions were also reported to be better.

Corporate Performance
21.
Sales of the private non-financial
corporate sector declined marginally
(0.9 per cent) in Q1 of 2009-10 on a
year-on-year basis as also in comparison
with Q4 of 2008-09 (1.7 per cent). In the
wake of the downturn, firms responded
quickly to the changed cyclical conditions
by reducing their inventories around Q2
of 2008-09. Now, with the onset of recovery
in Q1 of 2009-10, the upturn is characterised
by an increase in the stocks to sales ratio.
Year-on-year growth in net profits also
witnessed a turnaround in Q1 of 2009-10
after registering negative growth in the
preceding three quarters (Table 5).

23.
The outlook of manufacturing
companies for Q3 of 2009-10 maintains its
upward trend, with the BEI moving up to
116.4 from 109.9 in the previous quarter.
The respondents expect production and
capacity utilisation to improve further,
working capital finance requirement to
grow, the cost of raw materials to rise and
pricing power to return to them. On the back
of improved demand conditions, the
manufacturing companies also expect
further improvement in their employment
situation. The findings of the Reserve

The Reserve Bank has been
conducting a quarterly Industrial Outlook
Survey of manufacturing companies since
1998. The survey tracks business
expectations for the current quarter and
business outlook for the following quarter.

increases in prices of wheat (3.5 per cent)
and rice (5.9 per cent) were relatively low
as supply side pressures were mitigated by
the comfortable levels of foodgrain stocks
with public agencies which stood at 44.3
million tonnes as on October 1, 2009 as
against the minimum stock norm of 16.2
million tonnes. However, large increases
were recorded in prices of vegetables (59.3
per cent), tea (30.7 per cent), sugar,
khandsari and gur (28.7 per cent), egg,
meat and fish (25.3 per cent), pulses (19.2
per cent), jowar (14.9 per cent), condiments
and spices (14.2 per cent), milk (7.0
per cent) and fruits (5.2 per cent).

Bank’s Industrial Outlook Survey are
broadly consistent with business confidence
surveys conducted by other agencies such
as FICCI, NCAER, HSBC-Markit and Dun
and Bradstreet.
Inflation
24.
The headline inflation, as
measured by year-on-year variations in the
wholesale price index (WPI), which
remained negative during June-August
2009 due to the base effect, returned to
positive territory in September 2009. WPI
inflation was 1.21 per cent on October 10,
2009 as compared with 11.30 per cent a
year ago, and 0.84 per cent at end-March
2009. During the current financial year
(up to October 10, 2009), WPI has
increased by 5.95 per cent reflecting
higher food price inflation aggravated by
deficient monsoon.

26.
The current inflationary pressures,
as WPI moves from negative to positive
territory, are quite different from the
inflationary pressures witnessed in AprilOctober 2008. Although both inflation
episodes are driven by supply side
pressures, the inflation in 2008 was
triggered largely by a sharp increase in the
prices of basic metals and mineral oils. In
contrast, during the current episode, price
pressures are emanating from domestic
sources reflecting increase in prices of food
articles and food products (Chart 1).

25.
The upside risk of deficient
monsoon rainfall projected in the First
Quarter Review of July 2009 has since
materialised and prices of primary food
items and manufactured food products have
risen due to short supply. During the current
financial year (up to October 10, 2009), the

inflation of 4.99 per cent.

27.
At a disaggregated level, WPI
inflation rates of food articles, essential
commodities and manufactured food
products are currently in double digits and
are ruling much above their trend levels
(Table 6).

29.
The first occasion in the recent past
when CPI inflation diverged significantly
from WPI inflation was in mid-2004. The
divergence between the two inflation rates
persisted thereafter but remained within a
relatively narrow range. However, the
divergence has widened in the recent period
with WPI inflation turning negative even
as CPI inflation crossed double digits
(Chart 2). Several factors account for this
phenomenon. One, food prices, which have
higher weightage (in the range of 46-69
per cent) in the CPI measures than in WPI
(26 per cent), have risen sharply in the
recent period. Two, miscellaneous group
(representing services) in various CPIs
(weights in the range of 12-24 per cent)

28.
The recent contrarian movements
in the WPI and CPI inflation rates have
raised questions about the correlation
between them. In the short-term, inflation
rates based on WPI and CPIs could be
different due to differences in coverage
and weights. However, these differences
even out over time as wholesale price
changes are followed by changes in the
retail prices. For example, in the five year
period 2003-08, the average inflation based
on consumer price index for industrial
workers (CPI-IW) of 4.83 per cent was not

pressures; these services are not included
in WPI. Three, prices of metals, which do
not form part of the CPI group, have
declined sharply, thereby accentuating the
divergence between CPI and WPI inflation
rates. Four, while a strong base effect
pushed WPI inflation into negative territory
during June-August 2009, there was no base
effect in play for CPI inflation.

Asset prices have risen sharply in
the recent period. Stock prices have increased

for the first half of 2009-10, the actual
purchases were Rs.57,487 crore, the
shortfall from projection being on account
of easy liquidity conditions. Feedback
from the market participants indicates that
the OMO provided considerable comfort.

Review of July 2009, has been the
management of the large government
market borrowing programme in a
n o n - d i s r u p t i v e m a n n e r. F o r t h i s
purpose, the Reserve Bank initiated
several measures, some of which were
unconventional. First, the Reserve Bank
front-loaded the borrowing programme for
2009-10 as credit offtake by the private
sector is usually low in the first half.
Second, MSS securities of the order of
Rs.28,000 crore were de-sequestered.
Third, the Reserve Bank resorted to active
liquidity management by way of
unwinding of MSS securities and purchase
of securities through pre-announced
calendar of open market operations
(OMO). The unwinding of MSS securities
through redemption was of the order of
Rs.42,000 crore during the first half of the
year. Besides, as against the OMO

Rs.80,000 crore through the auction route

The Central Government has
already completed net market borrowing
of Rs. 3,19,911 crore (as much as 80.4
per cent of the budget estimate) through
dated securities during 2009-10 (up to
October 26, 2009) (Table 9). In addition, the
State Governments also mobilised Rs.58,683
crore (net) through the market borrowing
programme. Because of the front-loading
of the market borrowing programme, net
issuances under the Central Government
borrowing programme in the remaining
period of 2009-10 will be Rs.62,464 crore
(Table 9). Given the current level of
liquidity, it should be possible to complete
this borrowing programme smoothly.

Monetary Conditions

36.
Despite the large government
borrowing programme, the weighted
average yield of dated securities issued
under the Central Government borrowing
programme in 2009-10 (up to October 26,
2009) at 7.14 per cent was lower than the
yield of 8.81 per cent averaged for the
corresponding period of the previous year.
However, the yield on the 10-year
government securities rose from 7.01
per cent at end-March to 7.47 per cent in
early-September 2009 with increased
volatility. Subsequently, it stabilised around
7.35 per cent by mid-October 2009. The
Reserve Bank also varied the maturity
profile of debt issuances tailored to market
appetite. The weighted average maturity of
securities issued during 2009-10 (up to
October 26, 2009) was 11.0 years as
compared with the average maturity of 15.5
years in the corresponding period of the
previous year. Market participants indicate
that had there not been active liquidity and
maturity profile management by the
Reserve Bank, the yield perhaps would
have been significantly higher.

37.
Growth in monetary aggregates
during 2009-10 (up to October 9, 2009) has
evolved broadly in line with the projections.
The year-on-year growth in reserve money
(RM) turned negative reflecting the 400
basis points reduction in the cash reserve
ratio (CRR) of banks during October–
January 2008-09, which reduced the banks’
balances with the Reserve Bank. Adjusted
for the first round impact of changes in
the CRR, reserve money growth was
positive, but lower than in the previous
year (Table 10).
38.
The money supply (M3) growth on
a year-on-year basis at 18.9 per cent as on
October 9, 2009 remained above the
indicative projection of 18.0 per cent set
out in the First Quarter Review of July
2009. The main source of M3 expansion was
bank credit to the government reflecting
large market borrowings of the
Government. This is in contrast to what
happened in 2008-09, when bank credit to
the commercial sector and net foreign

significantly, with the growth rate (y-o-y)
falling to 11.2 per cent this year (as on
October 9, 2009) from 29.4 per cent a year
ago. On a financial year basis (up to
October 9, 2009) too, the growth in
scheduled commercial banks’ non-food
credit at 4.3 per cent is significantly lower
than the growth of 10.5 per cent in the
corresponding period of last year.

39.
Monetary management during
2009-10 has been informed by the
continued need to provide liquidity to
mitigate the adverse impact of the global
financial crisis and to complete the large
market borrowing programme of the
Government in a non-disruptive manner.
The phenomenon of substitution of foreign
assets by domestic assets, which began in
the second half of 2008-09, continued
during the first two months of the current
year. This trend, however, reversed after
May 2009, when capital inflows revived on
a net basis. Liquidity conditions have
remained comfortable since mid-November
2008. During 2009-10 (up to October 23,
2009), the average daily amount absorbed
by the Reserve Bank under the LAF
window was of the order of Rs.1,20,000
crore, indicating a large surplus with the
banking system, equivalent to 2.7 per cent
of the net demand and time liabilities
(NDTL).

41.
Several factors have contributed to
the slowdown in non-food bank credit. One,
overall credit demand from the
manufacturing sector slowed down
reflecting a decline in commodity prices
and drawdown of inventories. Two,
corporates were able to access non-bank
domestic sources of funds and external
financing – which had almost dried up
during the crisis – at lower costs. Three,
unlike in the previous year, oil marketing
companies reduced their borrowings from
the banking sector as oil prices moderated.
Four, a significant amount of bank finance
has gone to the corporate sector through
banks’ investment in units of mutual funds.
Five, banks have also reined in credit to the
retail sector due to the perceived increased
risk on account of the general slowdown.
This credit retrenchment was more
pronounced in the case of foreign banks and

per cent of total bank credit, the year-on-year
growth in bank credit to industry as of
August 2009 was lower than that in the
previous year. While the credit flow to
agriculture, real estate and NBFCs remained
high, it was lower for housing (Table 13).

private banks. This is evident from bank
group-wise analysis, which shows that
credit from private banks slowed down
sharply, while that from foreign banks
actually contracted (Table 12). Thus, despite
ample liquidity in the system, non-food
bank credit expansion slowed down.

Total Flow of Financial Resources to the
Commercial Sector

42.
Banks used the ample liquidity
available with them to make large
investments in government securities and
also fairly sizeable investments (of the
order of Rs.92,000 crore during the current
financial year so far) in units of mutual
funds. Consequently, commercial banks’
investments in SLR securities (including
securities acquired under the LAF)
increased to 30.4 per cent of their NDTL as
on October 9, 2009, up from 25.7 per cent a
year ago. Net of LAF collateral securities,
banks’ SLR investments were at 27.6
per cent of NDTL as on October 9, 2009.

44.
During the peak of the crisis (Third
Quarter Review of January, 2009), it was
noted that the flow of resources to the
commercial sector from both bank and
non-bank sources had contracted. While
bank credit continues to decelerate as
indicated earlier, there has been a
turnaround in financing from non-bank
sources. The resource flow from non-bank
sources increased in Q2 of 2009-10 with
increase in foreign direct investment,
pick-up in primary issues, increased support
from insurance companies, and large
investment by mutual funds in non-gilt debt
instruments. While the resource flow from

assurances by the Reserve Bank that it would
manage liquidity conditions and market
borrowing programme of the Government
in a non-disruptive manner (Chart 4).

48.
The yield on government securities
moved up with increased volatility during
the early part of the year in the face of a
large borrowing programme of the Central
and State Governments. There was a
sudden surge in bond yields in late August
due to change in market sentiment with
the yield on 10-year Government security
moving up by 42 basis points during
August 13 - September 3, 2009. However,
the yield stabilised subsequently on

49.
Presently, banks are permitted to
hold statutory liquidity ratio (SLR)
securities up to 25 per cent of their demand
and time liabilities (DTL) in the ‘held to
maturity’ (HTM) category of investments.
Recently, there has been some debate on
the need to raise this limit on the ground
that such a relaxation will mitigate the
upward pressure on G-Sec yields, and
consequently on the overall interest rate
regime. The Reserve Bank considered the

18

benchmark prime lending rates (BPLRs)
does not fully and accurately reflect the
changes in effective lending rates as nearly
two-thirds of banks’ lending takes place at
sub-BPLR rates. As such, the true
movements in lending rates of banks are
better captured in the weighted average
lending rates of banks. Rough estimates
show that the effective average lending rate
for scheduled commercial banks declined
from 12.3 per cent in March 2008 to 11.1
per cent by March 2009 – the latest period
for which data are available (Chart 5).
Further, data from select banks, as a proxy
measure for effective lending rates, suggest
that weighted average yield on advances
declined from 10.6 per cent in March 2009
to 10.3 per cent in June 2009.

advisability of raising the HTM limit. It
may be recalled that in 2004-05 banks
were allowed to shift SLR securities to the
HTM category as a one-time measure
subject to the total SLR securities held in
the HTM category capped at 25 per cent
of their DTL. This limit was kept
unchanged even as the SLR was reduced
from 25 per cent to 24 per cent in
November 2008. As the HTM ratio is
already higher than the prescribed SLR, it
is not considered desirable to further raise
the HTM ratio.
Transmission Mechanism
50.
The changes in the Reserve Bank’s
policy rates were quickly transmitted to the
money and debt markets. However,
transmission to the credit market was slow
due to several structural rigidities in the
system, especially fixed interest rate deposit
liabilities. As bank deposits, contracted in
the past at high rates, have started to mature
and banks have significantly reduced their
term deposit rates, the transmission of lower
policy rates to the credit market has
improved. In this context, it should be
recognised that the movement in the

51.
The analysis by the Working
Group on BPLR (Chairman: Shri Deepak
Mohanty), which submitted its Report on
October 20, 2009, has demonstrated that
though there was considerable divergence
in weighted average lending rates in 2004
among the various bank-groups, these have
tended to converge in the recent period.
The Group has recommended the
introduction of a Base Rate system.

Foreign Exchange Market

Equity Market

52.
The foreign exchange market
remained orderly during 2009-10 (up to
October 23, 2009) with the rupee exhibiting
a two-way movement against major
currencies. During the current financial
year, the rupee appreciated by 9.7 per cent
against the US dollar and 2.6 per cent
against the Japanese yen, whereas it
depreciated by 5.7 per cent against the
pound sterling and 3.2 per cent against the
euro (Chart 6). In terms of the real
exchange rate, the six-currency tradebased real effective exchange rate (REER)
(1993-94=100) moved up from 96.3 at endMarch 2009 to 104.2 by October 23, 2009.

53.
During the current financial year
(up to October 23, 2009), the secondary
segment of the domestic capital market has
remained buoyant. The stock market staged
a smart recovery reflecting large net FII
inflows due to the optimistic outlook for
the Indian economy. FIIs made net
purchases of US$ 13.8 billion in 2009-10
(up to October 21, 2009) in the Indian
equity market as against net sales of US$
8.6 billion in the corresponding period of
2008-09. The BSE Sensex rose from
9,709 at end-March 2009 to 16,811 on
October 23, 2009, showing an increase of
73.1 per cent during 2009-10 to date.

External Sector
54.
India’s external account has
remained comfortable during the current
financial year. Merchandise trade contracted
due to depressed external demand and
slowdown of the domestic economy, with
imports declining more than exports. The
trade deficit narrowed down to US$ 26.0
billion in Q1 of 2009-10 from US$ 31.4
billion in Q1 of 2008-09. However, trade
deficit in Q1 of 2009-10 was higher than
US$ 14.6 billion in Q4 of 2008-09 partly
due to a rise in crude oil prices (Table 18).
The current account deficit at US$ 5.8
billion in Q1 of 2009-10 was also lower
compared to the deficit of US$ 9.0 billion
in Q1 of 2008-09; a current account surplus
of US$ 4.7 billion was recorded in Q4 of
2008-09. The capital account showed a
turnaround from a negative balance in the
last two quarters of 2008-09 to a positive
balance of US$ 6.7 billion during Q1 of
2009-10.

II. Stance of Monetary Policy
daily average of almost Rs.1,20,000 crore.
The utilisation of the several refinance
facilities instituted by the Reserve Bank too
has been low, further evidencing the ample
liquidity situation. Interest rates in all the
markets have declined significantly over
the last one year as detailed before. The
transmission of lower policy rates to the
credit market has materialised with a lag.
With most commercial banks reducing their
deposit rates, the cost of funds has declined
enabling banks to reduce their BPLRs. The
effective lending rates have also come
down as nearly three-fourths of bank
lending takes place at rates below their
BPLRs as alluded to before.

57.
As a part of the accommodative
monetary policy followed since midSeptember 2008, the Reserve Bank has
provided ample rupee and dollar liquidity
and maintained a market environment
conducive for the continued flow of credit
to productive sectors at lower cost. The
important measures initiated include
reduction of the policy rates under the LAF
to their historically low levels, lowering
of reserve requirements, institution of
sector-specific liquidity facilities and a
forex swap facility, relaxation in the ECB
guidelines, countercyclical prudential
measures of adjustment in risk weights and
provisioning, and conditional special
regulatory treatment for restructured
assets.

Growth Projection
60.
During the first quarter of 2009-10,
real GDP recorded a growth of 6.1 per cent,
lower than the growth of 7.8 per cent in the
corresponding quarter of 2008-09, but
marginally higher than the 5.8 per cent
growth in the second half of 2008-09. The
south-west monsoon rainfall this year has
been the weakest since 1972 affecting both
yield and acreage of agricultural crops. This
will impact Kharif production and the
performance of agricultural production
during the Rabi season will be critical for
supply management. On the whole,
agricultural production in 2009-10 is
expected to be lower than in last year.

Liquidity Impact
58.
Consistent with its accommodative
monetary stance, the Reserve Bank
expanded its domestic assets through open
market operations (OMO) and unwinding
of market stabilisation scheme (MSS)
securities to provide primary liquidity to
support the required monetary expansion.
Several measures taken by the Reserve
Bank since mid-September 2008 have
augmented actual/potential liquidity in the
system on the aggregate by Rs.5,85,000
crore.
59.
As a result of the extraordinary
monetary easing by the Reserve Bank, the
banking system has been awash with
liquidity since November 2008. This is
reflected most prominently in the
absorption under the LAF window of a

61.
While external demand has
continued to contract, large fiscal and
monetary stimulus measures have
bolstered domestic consumption and
helped the recovery in the industrial sector.
22

The prospects of the industrial sector have
become more promising than they were at
the time of the First Quarter Review. With
the recovery in the stock market, the
primary segment of the capital market has
also witnessed increased activity in the
recent period. This, combined with the
easing of international financing
conditions, augurs well for a pick-up in
investment activity. The business
confidence surveys also point to further
improvement in outlook despite weak
perception of export demand.

Inflation Projection
63.
Headline WPI inflation turned
negative during June-August 2009 due to
the large statistical base effect. As
anticipated in the First Quarter Review,
WPI inflation has returned to positive
territory, albeit a few weeks sooner than
expected, in the wake of large increase in
prices of food items and increase in global
crude oil prices.
64.
The upside risks on account of
deficiency in monsoon rainfall indicated in
First Quarter Review of July 2009 have now
materialised as prices of food items have
risen sharply. Going forward, Rabi crop
prospects would be critical in shaping the
path of food inflation. The large stock of
foodgrains with public agencies should help
mitigate any significant adverse impact due
to supply constraints. The improved terms
of trade for agriculture in recent years
should provide an incentive to the sector.

62.
Various services sector activities,
which have slowed down significantly in
the recent period, should also catch up,
albeit wit h a lag, in tandem with
improved industrial growth. Assuming a
modest decline in agricultural production
and a faster recovery in industrial
production, the baseline projection for
GDP growth for 2009-10 is placed at 6.0
per cent with an upside bias (Chart 7).
Thus, the GDP projection for 2009-10 for
policy purposes remains unaltered from
that made in the First Quarter Review of
July 2009.

65.
Global commodity prices, which
had bottomed out in early-2009, rebounded
ahead of global recovery. The global oil
prices present a mixed picture. Crude oil

consumption patterns. This underscores
the need to expedite the revision of
coverage and updating of the base year for
the WPI series as also the proposed two
consumer price indices, i.e., CPI-Urban
and CPI-Rural.

prices, which increased from their low
levels of January-March 2009, have
remained range-bound since June 2009.
Large global liquidity due to easy monetary
policy followed by major central banks has
led to sizeable financialisation of the
commodities market, especially for those
products that are prone to demand supply
gaps. These developments may induce
greater volatility in commodity prices in the
coming years.

67.
The First Quarter Review of July
2009 projected WPI inflation for end-March
2010 at around 5.0 per cent. The July
Review indicated that the risk to this
projection was on the upside. Though the
year-on-year WPI inflation was 1.21
per cent as on October 10, 2009, it has
already increased by 5.95 per cent on a
financial year basis though some of the
increase is seasonal and is likely to soften.
However, the base effect, which resulted
in negative WPI inflation during JuneAugust 2009, is now expected to work in
the reverse direction accentuated by high
food prices. The Reserve Bank’s quarterly
inflation expectations survey for
households indicates that while inflationary
expectations remain contained, a majority
of the respondents expect inflation rate to
increase over the next three months as also
over the next year.

66.
Inflation assessment has become
increasingly complex in recent times with
the WPI inflation rate remaining negative
or low and the various CPI inflation
measures remaining close to or above the
double digits for an extended period. CPI
inflation has remained at an elevated level
since March 2008 and did not decline as
expected in line with fall in WPI inflation.
Indeed, it hardened due to sharp increase
in essential commodity prices. The situation
was aggravated by the deficient monsoon
rainfall and drought condition in several
parts of the country. The Reserve Bank
monitors an array of measures of inflation,
both overall and disaggregated
components, in conjunction with other
economic and financial indicators, to assess
the underlying inflationary pressures and
articulates its policy stance in terms of WPI.
The Government took a decision on
October 19, 2009 to reduce the frequency
of the current series of Wholesale Price
Index (base:1993-94) from weekly to
monthly. The available indices, WPI and
the four measures of CPI, fail to adequately
capture the underlying inflationary
conditions because of inadequate coverage
and also because the respective base years
do not capture the changed production and

68.
Keeping in view the global trend
in commodity prices and the domestic
demand-supply balance, the baseline
projection for WPI inflation at end-March
2010 is placed at 6.5 per cent with an upside
bias (Chart 8). This is higher than the 5.0
per cent WPI inflation projected in the First
Quarter Review of July 2009 as the upside
risks have materialised.
69.
As always, the Reserve Bank will
endeavour to ensure price stability and
anchor inflation expectations. The conduct
of monetary policy will continue to

market borrowing programme for 2009-10
is now completed. In 2009-10 (up to
October 9, 2009), credit has expanded by
Rs.1,14,800 crore. Thus, to attain the
projected growth of 20 per cent, banks will
need to expand credit by Rs.4,40,000 crore
in the remaining part of the year, which will
be difficult unless demand for retail credit
accelerates. Also, access of corporates to
non-bank sources of financing, both
domestic and international, has eased,
which could lead to substitution of bank
credit. While credit demand is expected to
pick up during the second-half of 2009-10,
attaining the projected growth of 20 per cent
is unlikely.

condition and contain perception of
inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent.
This will be in line with the medium-term
objective of 3.0 per cent inflation consistent
with India’s broader integration with the
global economy.
Monetary Projection
70.
The year-on-year growth in money
supply (M3) increased from 18.6 per cent
in end-March 2009 to 18.9 per cent by
October 9, 2009. A major source of M 3
expansion this year has been the banking
system’s financing of the large market
borrowing of the Government, including
OMO purchases by the Reserve Bank. The
growth in bank credit to the commercial
sector has moderated significantly to 10.7
per cent from the high level of 27.4 per cent
a year ago.

72.
Keeping in view the borrowing
requirement of the government and of the
commercial sector in the remaining period
of 2009-10, the indicative projection of
money supply growth of 18.0 per cent set
out in July 2009 is revised downwards to
17.0 per cent. Consistent with this,
aggregate deposits of scheduled
commercial banks are projected to grow by
18.0 per cent. The growth in adjusted

The First Quarter Review of July

government market borrowing programme
did not crowd out the credit flow to the
private sector. Over 80 per cent of the

Third, somewhat related to the
point above, India has traditionally been a
supply constrained economy in contrast to
advanced economies which are demand
starved. We need, in particular, to expand
the supply of infrastructure – power, roads,
urban infrastructure and social
infrastructure. The supply constraints which
remained subdued during the crisis period
owing to weak demand, will re-emerge and
may indeed become binding.

undertakings and private corporate sector
and CPs, is also revised downwards to 18.0
per cent from 20.0 per cent set out in the
Annual Policy Statement and the First
Quarter Review. Banks are urged once
again to step up their efforts towards credit
expansion while preserving credit quality
which is critical for revival of growth.
Overall Assessment
73.
There has been a discernible
improvement in the global economic
outlook since the First Quarter Review in
July 2009. In India too, there are definitive
indications of the economy reverting to the
growth track. Accordingly, attention around
the world, as also in India, has shifted from
managing the crisis to managing the
recovery.

77.
Fourth and importantly, India is one
of the few large emerging economies with
twin deficits – fiscal and current account
deficits. While our current account deficit
is modest, and may even be benign given
the investment requirements of the
economy, there can be no two views about
the need to make a responsible, credible and
time-bound fiscal adjustment. The
arguments for fiscal consolidation and
rectitude are compelling and widely known,
and need not be repeated here. But an issue
of some immediate relevance is the critical
need to downsize the government borrowing
programme so as to help sustain a moderate
interest rate regime. This is crucial for
investment demand to pick up on which
hinge our long-term economic prospects.

74.
The policy dilemma for India is
different in some important respects from
that of advanced economies as also other
emerging market economies. First, most of
these countries do not face an immediate
risk of inflation. Indeed, in several
advanced economies, the concerns were
about a possible deflation, which are just
about waning. On the other hand, India is
actively confronted with an upturn in
inflation – a rising WPI inflation and
stubbornly elevated CPI inflation.

78.
Around the world, there is an
active, and at times animated debate on
the timing and sequencing of exit from the
expansionary monetary stance. ‘Exit’ is a
central issue in our policy matrix too. As
the Reserve Bank has indicated in several
public statements, our current monetary
stance is not the steady state and we need
to reverse the expansionary stance. It is
important to recognise though that the
exit debate in India is qualitatively

75.
Second, advanced economies are
faced with households, firms and financial
institutions still struggling with their
impaired balance sheets. Fortunately, we
do not have this problem in India, but we
still have the challenge of reviving
domestic consumption and investment
demand, the traditional, dominant drivers
of our growth.
26

different from that in other advanced and
emerging economies because of the unique
features of our macroeconomic context
indicated above.

the next three months as also one year. The
lag with which monetary policy operates
suggests that there is a case for tightening
sooner rather than later.

79.
The precise challenge for the
Reserve Bank is to support the recovery
process without compromising on price
stability. This calls for a careful management
of trade-offs. Growth drivers warrant a
delayed exit, while inflation concerns call
for an early exit. Premature exit will derail
the fragile growth, but a delayed exit can
potentially engender inflation expectations.

83.
Forceful arguments for early
reversal of monetary policy also arise from
liquidity concerns. The LAF window has
been absorbing over Rs.100,000 crore on a
daily basis since May 2009, save for a few
days on account of temporary increases in
government balances. This evidences the
large amount of liquidity in the system
which could potentially result in an
unsustainable asset price build-up. There is
already some evidence of excess liquidity
feeding through asset prices with potential
financial stability concerns. Further, capital
flows have resumed. Given the limitations
of the economy’s current absorptive
capacity, these flows will add to the overall
domestic liquidity, further fuelling the asset
price build-up. Large capital inflows and
asset price inflation have the potential to
feed on each other. From the liquidity
dimension, it is further argued that the
current large overhang of liquidity could
engender inflation expectation even if credit
demand remains subdued.

80.
The Reserve Bank has consulted a
wide array of stakeholders in the run up to
this policy review. Based on these
consultations, the arguments for and against
reversal of the expansionary monetary
policy stance can be summarised as follows.
Arguments for Beginning Reversal of
Monetary Easing
81.
The most dominant argument for
reversing monetary policy easing stems
from the concern about inflation. WPI
inflation has turned positive, the base effect
which has kept WPI low so far is now gone
and CPI inflation has remained stubbornly
elevated. On a financial year basis, WPI
has already increased by 5.95 per cent.
Inasmuch as monetary policy acts with a
lag, there is need to act now.

Arguments for Deferring Reversal of
Monetary Easing
84.
The dominant argument for
continuing with the current monetary stance
is that the recovery is as yet fragile. Exports
are still on the decline and the recent
improvement in industrial production
overstates the recovery as part of it is due
to the base effect and the one time impact
of restocking inventory. Premature
tightening will hurt the growth impulses.

82.
It is further argued that even though
the current inflationary pressures are driven
by food prices, they can strengthen
expectations of higher inflation and lead to
generalised inflation. The Reserve Bank’s
inflation expectations survey shows that
households expect inflation to increase over
27

On the other hand, it is imperative to
continue with the accommodative stance to
compensate for the decline in agricultural
output and till there is firm evidence of
sustained global recovery.

88.
The Reserve Bank has studied
these arguments. Some of the arguments are
persuasive and some less so. The balance
of judgment at the current juncture is that
it may be appropriate to sequence the ‘exit’
in a calibrated way so that while the
recovery process is not hampered, inflation
expectations remain anchored. The ‘exit’
process can begin with the closure of some
special liquidity support measures.

85.
The second argument against an
immediate reversal of monetary easing is
that the current inflationary pressures are
driven by supply side constraints,
particularly food prices. Monetary policy
is typically not an efficient instrument for
reining in food price inflation. There could,
of course, be concerns that rising food prices
could spark inflationary expectations. But
the probability of that is low as food prices
are likely to ease in the coming months
following the seasonal trend. The promising
Rabi crop prospects also will reduce food
price pressures. Under these circumstances,
the downside risks to any tightening now
are high with virtually no upside.

89.
It will be recalled that in response
to the crisis, like most other central banks,
the Reserve Bank too instituted both
conventional measures and unconventional
measures. While reversing of conventional
measures is not considered appropriate for
now, many of the unconventional measures
can be reversed immediately. The following
measures constitute the first phase of ‘exit’.
90.
The statutory liquidity ratio (SLR),
which was reduced from 25 per cent of
demand and time liabilities to 24 per cent,
is being restored to 25 per cent. The limit
for export credit refinance facility [(under
section 17(3A) of the RBI Act], which was
raised to 50 per cent of eligible outstanding
export credit, is being returned to the
pre-crisis level of 15 per cent. The two
non-standard refinance facilities: (i) special
refinance facility for scheduled commercial
banks under section 17(3B) of the RBI Act
(available up to March 31, 2010), and
(ii) special term repo facility for scheduled
commercial banks (for funding to MFs,
NBFCs, and HFCs) (available up to March
31, 2010) are being discontinued with
immediate effect. Details in this regard are
indicated in the subsequent sections of this
Statement.

86.
The third argument for maintaining
the accommodative monetary stance for
now is that any reversal at this stage will
harden yields on government bonds putting
upward pressure on interest rates and
dampening both consumption and
investment demand. This could seriously
unravel the incipient recovery.
87.
Finally, capital flows have resumed
on the promise of India’s growth prospects.
It is argued that if we tighten ahead of other
economies, the wider interest rate differential
will become a perverse incentive for even
larger capital flows. In managing capital
flows in excess of the current account deficit,
the economy will have to pay a cost which
will be a combination of exchange rate
appreciation, larger systemic liquidity and
fiscal costs of sterilisation.

Policy Stance

adequately met while also securing price
stability and financial stability.

91.
On the basis of the above overall
assessment, the stance of monetary policy
for the remaining period of 2009-10 will
be as follows:

•

Keep a vigil on the trends in inflation
and be prepared to respond swiftly and
effectively through policy adjustments
to stabilise inflation expectations.

•

Monitor the liquidity situation closely
and manage it actively to ensure that
credit demands of productive sectors are

•

Maintain a monetary and interest rate
regime consistent with price stability
and financial stability, and supportive of
the growth process.

92.
In conclusion, it bears emphasis that
the Reserve Bank is mindful of its
fundamental commitment to price stability.
It will continue to monitor the price situation
in its entirety and will take measures as
warranted by the evolving macroeconomic
conditions swiftly and effectively.

III. Monetary Measures
flexibly including the right to accept or reject
tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially,
so as to make efficient use of the LAF in
daily liquidity management.

Bank Rate
93.
The Bank Rate has been retained
unchanged at 6.0 per cent.
Repo Rate

Cash Reserve Ratio

94.
The repo rate under the Liquidity
Adjustment Facility (LAF) has been
retained unchanged at 4.75 per cent.

98.
The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of
scheduled banks has been retained
unchanged at 5.0 per cent of their net demand
and time liabilities (NDTL).

Reverse Repo Rate

99.
The collateralised borrowing and
lending obligation (CBLO) liabilities of
scheduled banks were exempted from
CRR prescription in order to develop
CBLO as a money market instrument.
Volumes in the CBLO segment have
increased over the years, especially after
the phasing out of the non-banks from the
inter-bank market. The daily average
volume in the CBLO segment, which was
only Rs.6 crore in January 2003, is now
over Rs.60,000 crore. Since the objective
of developing CBLO as a money market

95.
The reverse repo rate under the
LAF has been retained unchanged at 3.25
per cent.
96.
The Reserve Bank has the
flexibility to conduct repo/reverse repo
auctions at a fixed rate or at variable rates
as circumstances warrant.
97.
The Reserve Bank retains the option
to conduct overnight or longer term repo/
reverse repo under the LAF depending on
market conditions and other relevant factors.
The Reserve Bank will continue to use this

surplus funds being placed by banks daily
in the LAF window of the Reserve Bank.
Accordingly, it has been decided to:

instrument has been broadly achieved, it
is proposed that:

•

liabilities of scheduled banks arising
from transactions in CBLO with
Clearing Corporation of India Ltd.
(CCIL) will be subject to maintenance
of CRR with effect from the fortnight
beginning November 21, 2009.

•

restore the SLR for scheduled
commercial banks to 25 per cent of
their NDTL with effect from the
fortnight beginning November 7, 2009.

101. SCBs are currently maintaining
SLR investments at 27.6 per cent of their
NDTL, net of LAF collateral securities, and
30.4 per cent of NDTL, inclusive of LAF
collateral securities. As such, the increase
in the SLR will not impact the liquidity
position of the banking system and credit
to the private sector.

Statutory Liquidity Ratio
100.
In view of difficult macroeconomic
situation and liquidity conditions in the
global and domestic financial markets after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the
statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled
commercial banks (SCBs) was reduced from
25 per cent to 24 per cent of their NDTL
with effect from November 8, 2008. The
liquidity situation has remained comfortable
since mid-November 2008 as reflected in the

Third Quarter Review
102. The Third Quarter Review of
Monetary Policy for 2009-10 will be
undertaken on January 29, 2010.

Part B. Developmental and Regulatory Policies
103. The global financial crisis raised
issues that we thought were settled and
reopened questions that we thought had
been answered. It also pointed to the
egregious policies and practices in financial
sector regulation and supervision.
Reflecting the lessons of the crisis, there is
now active debate and discussion at the
global level on reforming the regulatory
structures and supervisory processes. This
is expected to be a continuous process with
reform packages being agreed upon and
finalised in a modular fashion on a regular
basis over the next couple of years.

participant at the global discussions. The
task for us will be to reflect our point of
view in the global debate and adapt the
global policies and guidelines to the Indian
situation on a dynamic basis. A task that
the Reserve Bank has all along been
performing but is now explicitly defined is
monitoring and ensuring financial stability.
Furthermore, we need to actively pursue the
challenge of financial inclusion.
105.
Reform is a continuous process.
Over the last several years, the Reserve Bank
has endeavoured to make reforms a
consultative and participative endeavour. It
is now standard practice for the Reserve
Bank to consult stakeholders before policy
reviews, seek comments from experts, place
draft policy proposals on its website for
feedback and to disseminate policies widely.
We will continue to improve these practices.

104. India has been less affected by the
crisis than most other countries because of
our relatively cautious policies, prudent
regulation and effective supervision.
Nonetheless, there are lessons from the
crisis for India too, which include:
(i) further strengthening regulation at the
systemic and institutional levels; (ii) making
our supervision more effective and value
adding; and (iii) improving our skills in risk
management. India has been an active

status of past policy announcements
together with a listing of fresh policies is
set out below.

I. Financial Stability
excessive risk-taking; (iii) improve the
over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives
market; (iv) create more powerful tools to
hold large global firms to account for the
risks they take; and (v) ensure that standards
for large global financial firms are
commensurate with the cost of their
failure. It was also agreed to reform the
global architecture to meet the needs of
the 21st century.

107. At the recently held G-20 Summit
during September 24-25, 2009 in
Pittsburgh, it was decided, among others,
to make sure that the global regulatory
system for banks and other financial
firms reins in the excesses that led to the
crisis and as such committed to: (i) raise
capital standards; (ii) implement strong
international compensation standards
aimed at ending practices that led to
31

(ii) prepare financial stability reports;
(iii) develop database of key variables
which could impact financial stability
and a time series of a core set of financial
indicators; (iv) conduct systemic stress
tests to assess resilience; and (v) develop
models for assessing financial stability.
The FSU also provides the secretariat to
the Reserve Bank’s representative in the
Financial Stability Board (FSB). The
FSU is expected to bring out the first
Financial Stability Report by endDecember 2009.

108. Keeping in view both international
and domestic initiatives in the financial
sector, the Annual Policy Statement of
April 2009 indicated setting up of a
Financial Stability Unit (FSU) in the
Reserve Bank. Accordingly, the FSU was
constituted in July 2009 drawing upon
inter-disciplinary expertise from the
regulatory, supervisory, statistics, economics
and financial markets departments of the
Reserve Bank. The FSU will: (i) conduct
macro-prudential surveillance of the
financial system on an ongoing basis;

II. Interest Rate Policy
BPLR System: Review

was constituted in June 2009 and the Group
submitted its Report on October 20, 2009.
The Report of the Working Group was also
placed on the Reserve Bank’s website on the
same day for comments and suggestions.
The Reserve Bank will consider the
recommendations after taking into account
the feedback received on the Report.

109. The Annual Policy Statement of
April 2009 proposed constituting a Working
Group to review the present benchmark
prime lending rate (BPLR) system and
suggest changes to make credit pricing
more transparent. Accordingly, a Working
Group (Chairman: Shri Deepak Mohanty)

III. Financial Markets
were placed on the Reserve Bank’s website
in August 2009. The National Stock
Exchange (NSE) commenced trading in
IRFs on August 31, 2009.

Financial Market Products
Interest Rate Futures
110.
The Annual Policy Statement of
April 2009 had indicated launching of
exchange traded interest rate futures (IRFs)
contracts on the 10-year notional coupon
bearing Government of India bond.
Accordingly, in consultation with the
Securities and Exchange Board of India
(SEBI), IRFs were introduced and the
directions covering the framework for
trading of IRFs on recognised exchanges

Introduction of Repo in Corporate Bonds
111.
The Reserve Bank had placed on
its website, on September 17, 2009, the
draft guidelines on repo in corporate bonds
for comments/feedback. The draft
guidelines were also deliberated by the
Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on
32

Money, Foreign Exchange and Government
Securities Markets at its meeting held on
September 23, 2009. With DvP-I (trade-bytrade) based clearing and settlement system
for OTC trades in corporate bonds being
operationalised by the clearing houses of
the exchanges, repo in corporate bonds can
now be introduced. Accordingly:

•

the lines of the guidelines for issuance of
commercial paper (CP). Accordingly:

•

draft guidelines are being formulated
which will be placed on the Reserve
Bank’s website by end-November 2009
for comments/suggestions.

Introduction of Credit Default
Swaps (CDS)

final guidelines on repo in corporate
bonds will be issued by end-November
2009.

113.
In 2007, the Reserve Bank had
issued draft guidelines for introduction of
credit default swaps (CDS) in India.
However, the issuance of final guidelines
was kept in abeyance keeping in view the
role of credit derivatives in the recent
financial crisis. It was considered
appropriate to proceed with caution
reflecting the lessons from the financial
crisis in this regard. In order to align with
the international work already conducted/
underway in the area of credit derivatives,
and keeping in view the specifics of the
Indian markets, it is proposed:

Regulation of Non-Convertible
Debentures (NCDs) of Maturity of
Less than One Year
112.
At present, issuance of nonconvertible debentures (NCDs) with
maturity of less than one year is not subjected
to regulation by the SEBI or the Government
of India. It was decided in the High Level
Coordination Committee on Financial
Markets (HLCCFM) that such instruments
being ‘money market instruments’ needed
to be brought under the regulation of the
Reserve Bank. A Working Group with
representation from the Reserve Bank and
the SEBI was, therefore, set up to examine
the issue. The Working Group, which has
since submitted its Report, has
recommended that the Reserve Bank may
frame regulations on issuance of NCDs with
maturity of less than one year, as
they fall under the definition of ‘money
market instruments’ of Chapter IIID of
the Reserve Bank of India (Amendment) Act,
2006. The recommendations of the Working
Group were discussed in the meeting of the
TAC on Money, Foreign Exchange and
Government Securities Markets on
September 23, 2009 and it was agreed that
the Reserve Bank may frame regulations on

•

to i n t r o d u c e p l a i n v a n i l l a O T C
single-name CDS for corporate bonds
for resident entities subject to
appropriate safeguards. To begin with,
all CDS trades will be required to be
reported to a centralised trade reporting
platform and in due course they will be
brought on a central clearing platform.

114.
The Reserve Bank is setting up an
internal Group to finalise the operational
framework in consultation with market
participants.
Separate Trading for Registered
Interest and Principal of Securities
(STRIPS)
115.
As indicated in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009, the draft
33

guidelines on stripping/reconstitution of
government securities were placed on the
Reserve Bank’s website on May 1, 2009
inviting comments/suggestions from
market participants by May 29, 2009. Based
on the feedback/suggestions received from
the market participants, the guidelines have
been finalised. Banks will be permitted to
strip/reconstitute eligible securities held in
their held to maturity (HTM)/available for
sale (AFS)/held for trade (HFT) portfolios.
Accordingly:

•

combined average daily turnover of the
contracts in all the three exchanges
increased from US$ 1.1 billion in March
2009 to US$ 2.5 billion in September 2009.
Market participants have been representing
that trading of currency future contracts in
other major currency pairs may also be
permitted to facilitate direct hedging of their
risk in such currencies. Accordingly, it is
proposed:

•

STRIPS will be launched, as scheduled,
during the current financial year.

Floating Rate Bonds (FRBs)
116.
As announced in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009, the issuance
structure of floating rate bonds (FRBs) has
been revised, addressing issues relating to
product design. The FRBs will henceforth
be issued by way of ‘price-based’ auction
as against the earlier ‘spread-based’ auction.
The revised issuance structure of FRBs
has been built into the negotiated dealing
system (NDS) auction platform, which
was operationalised on May 11, 2009.
Accordingly:

•

to permit the recognised stock exchanges
to offer currency futures contracts in
currency pairs of Euro-INR, Japanese
Yen-INR and Pound Sterling-INR, in
addition to US dollar-rupee contracts
which are already permitted.

118.
Necessary amendments to
Currency Futures (Reserve Bank)
Directions, 2008 are being made separately.
Guidelines on Forex, Commodity
and Freight Derivatives
119.
In light of the developments in the
domestic and international financial
markets and based on the feedback received
from banks, market participants, industry
associations and others, the existing
guidelines on foreign exchange and
commodity and freight derivatives overseas
have been reviewed by an internal Group.
The draft proposals were discussed in the
meeting of the TAC on Money, Foreign
Exchange and Government Securities
Markets. Accordingly:

floating rate bonds will be issued during
the current financial year depending
upon the market conditions and market
appetite.

Expansion of Currency Pairs of
Currency Futures Contracts

•

117.
Currently, persons resident in India
are permitted to trade in US dollar-Indian
rupee (INR) currency futures contracts in
three recognised stock exchanges. The

the draft guidelines are being placed
on the Reserve Bank’s website by
end-November 2009 for wider
dissemination and comments/views.

available up to March 31, 2010: (i) the export
credit refinance (ECR) facility (limit up to
50 per cent of eligible outstanding rupee
export credit) under Section 17(3A) of the
Reserve Bank of India Act (RBI); (ii) the
special refinance facility for scheduled
commercial banks [limit up to one per cent
of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL)
as on October 24, 2008] under Section
17(3B) of the RBI Act; (iii) special term repo
facility to scheduled commercial banks for
funding to mutual funds (MFs), non-banking
financial companies (NBFCs) and housing
finance companies (HFCs) [limit is in terms
of relaxation in the statutory liquidity
ratio (SLR) up to 1.5 per cent of NDTL];
(iv) refinance facility to Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI),
National Housing Bank (NHB) and
Export- Import Bank of India (EXIM Bank)
[under Section 17(4H), Section 17(4DD) and
Section 17(4J), respectively, of the RBI Act];
and (v) the forex swap facility to banks for
tenor up to three months.

Financial Market Infrastructure
Revision of Repo Accounting
120.
The Annual Policy Statement of
April 2009 had indicated issuance of
revised guidelines on repo accounting
taking into account comments on the draft
guidelines earlier placed on the Reserve
Bank’s website for implementation from
April 1, 2010. Accordingly:

•

the final guidelines are under
consideration and will be issued by
end-November 2009.

Clearing and Settlement of OTC Trades
in Corporate Bonds: Status
121.
As announced in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009, the clearing
houses of the exchanges, viz., National
Securities Clearing Corporation Limited
(NSCCL) and Indian Clearing Corporation
Limited (ICCL) have been permitted to
maintain transitory pooling accounts with
the Reserve Bank for facilitating settlement
of OTC transactions in corporate bonds in
the real time gross settlement (RTGS)
system on a DvP-I basis (i.e., on a tradeby-trade basis). The Reserve Bank and
SEBI have issued necessary instructions
requiring specified regulated entities to
clear and settle all OTC trades in corporate
bonds through the NSCCL or ICCL with
effect from December 1, 2009.

123.
A review of these facilities,
indicated that the utilisation of these facilities
has been low. Keeping this in view and
taking into account the current liquidity
conditions in the markets, it is proposed to
take the following actions with immediate
effect:

•

to reduce the limit of export credit
refinance facility from 50 per cent to
15 per cent of eligible outstanding rupee
export credit extended under Section
17(3A) of the RBI Act;

•

to discontinue the special refinance
facility for scheduled commercial banks
instituted under Section 17(3B) of the
RBI Act;

Money Market
Refinance/Special Liquidity Facilities
122.
As indicated in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009, the following
liquidity facilities provided by the Reserve
Bank to banks and financial institutions are
35

•

to discontinue the special term repo
facility for scheduled commercial banks
for funding to mutual funds, non-banking
financial companies and housing finance
companies; and

•

to discontinue the forex swap facility of
banks.

and submission of competitive bids only
through the NDS; and (ii) submission of a
single consolidated bid on behalf of all its
constituents by the bank/primary dealer
(PD) in respect of non-competitive bids,
have been implemented with effect from
May 22, 2009. The implementation of the
recommendations of the Working Group
has improved the efficiency of the auction
process by reducing the time taken for
announcement of the auction results,
thereby enhancing the time available for
trading in the auctioned securities.

124. The refinance facility to SIDBI,
NHB and EXIM Bank [under Section
17(4H), Section 17(4DD) and Section
17(4J), respectively, of the RBI Act]
will continue to be in operation till the
pre-announced date of March 31, 2010.
However, these three financial institutions
(FIs) will have to ensure that all
outstandings are repaid by the close of
business on March 31, 2010.

Non-Competitive Bidding in the Auction
of State Development Loans (SDLs):
Status
126.
In order to widen the investor base
and enhance the liquidity for State
Development Loans (SDLs), a scheme for
non-competitive bidding in the auction of
SDLs was notified by all State Governments
on July 20, 2007. In pursuance of the
announcement made in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009, the scheme for
non-competitive bidding in SDLs has been
operationalised with effect from August 25,
2009. Under the scheme, up to 10 per cent
of the notified amount of SDLs will be
allotted to eligible individuals and institutions,
subject to a maximum of one per cent of the
notified amount for single bid per stock. An
investor can submit only a single bid in an
auction of SDL through a bank or PD.

Government Securities Market
Auction Process of Government of
India Securities: Status
125. As indicated in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009, the specific
notification for auction for sale of
government securities along with the
scheme for non-competitive bidding facility
has been amended by the Government of
India in consultation with the Reserve
Bank. Accordingly, the remaining
recommendations of the internal Working
Group (Chairman: H.R. Khan) pertaining to
the Reserve Bank such as: (i) withdrawal
of the facility of bidding in physical form

IV. Credit Delivery Mechanism and Other Banking Services

policies for the micro and small enterprises
(MSEs), duly approved by their respective
Boards with regard to: (i) loan policy
governing extension of credit facilities;
(ii) restructuring/rehabilitation policy for
revival of potentially viable sick units/
enterprises; and (iii) non-discretionary onetime settlement scheme for recovery of nonperforming loans. Other recommendations
pertaining to the Government of India/State
Governments/State Level Bankers’
Committee (SLBC) convener banks were
forwarded to them for necessary action. The
regional offices of the Reserve Bank were
advised to monitor the actions initiated by
the State Governments/SLBC convener
banks and discuss the progress in this regard
in the SLBC meetings.

announced in the Union Budget 2008-09.
Out of this, Rs.28,000 crore was passed on
to the National Bank for Agriculture and
Rural Development (NABARD) for
reimbursing the claims of regional rural
banks (RRBs) and co-operatives and the
remaining amount was earmarked for
reimbursing the claims of scheduled
commercial banks (SCBs), local area
banks (LABs) and urban co-operative
banks (UCBs). Till date, SCBs and UCBs
have been reimbursed to the extent of
64.7 per cent of their ‘debt waiver’ claims.
Rural Co-operative Banks
Licensing of Co-operatives: Status
130.
The Committee on Financial Sector
Assessment (Chairman: Dr. Rakesh Mohan
and Co-Chairman: Shri Ashok Chawla) had
recommended that rural co-operative banks
which fail to obtain a license by 2012
should not be allowed to continue to
operate. Accordingly, it was proposed, in
the Annual Policy Statement of April 2009,
to work out a roadmap for achieving this
objective in a non-disruptive manner. The
criteria for licensing of these banks have
been drafted in consultation with the
NABARD and action with regard to
issuance of licenses has been initiated. At
present, 17 out of 31 state co-operative
banks, and 296 out of 371 central co-operative
banks are unlicensed.

128. The Annual Policy Statement of
April 2009 also proposed that the Standing
Advisory Committee on MSEs would
review the credit guarantee scheme.
Accordingly, a Working Group (Chairman:
Shri V. K. Sharma) was constituted to
review the credit guarantee scheme of the
Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and
Small Enterprises (CGFTMSE) and also
examine the feasibility of a ‘whole turnover
guarantee’ for the MSE portfolio. The
Working Group is expected to submit its
report by end-December 2009.
Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt
Relief Scheme, 2008: Status
129. A scheme of agricultural debt
waiver and debt relief for farmers with the
total value of overdue loans being waived
estimated at Rs.50,000 crore and a one-time
settlement (OTS) relief on the overdue
loans estimated at Rs.10,000 crore was

Revival of Rural Co-operative Credit
Structure: Status
131.
Based on the recommendations

Rural Co-operative Credit Institutions
37

(Chairman: Prof. A. Vaidyanathan) and in
consultation with the State Governments,
the Government of India had approved a
package for revival of the short-term rural
co-operative credit structure. So far, as
envisaged under the package, 25 States
have entered into Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) with the
Government of India and the NABARD.
Twelve States have made amendments to
their respective Co-operative Societies Acts.
As on July 31, 2009, an aggregate amount
of Rs.6,639 crore has been released by the
NABARD as Government of India’s share
under the package to primary agricultural
credit societies (PACS) in 10 States. The
National Implementing and Monitoring
Committee (NIMC) set up by the
Government of India is monitoring the
implementation of the revival package.

viability, relevance of a separate package
and strategy for implementation.
Regional Rural Banks
Capital to Risk-weighted Assets Ratio
(CRAR) for RRBs: Status
133. On the basis of the recommendations
of the Committee on Financial Sector
Assessment (Chairman: Dr. Rakesh Mohan
and Co-Chairman: Shri Ashok Chawla), the
Annual Policy Statement of April 2009
proposed to introduce CRAR for RRBs in a
phased manner, taking into account the status
of recapitalisation and amalgamation. The
Government of India has constituted a
Committee (Chairman: Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty)
with representatives from the Government,
sponsor banks, RRBs and the NABARD to
examine the financials of the RRBs and
suggest a roadmap to raise the CRAR of
RRBs to nine per cent by March 2012. The
Committee is expected to submit its report
by end-January 2010.

132.
Furthermore, a study of the long-term
co-operative credit structure was entrusted
by the Government of India to the same
Task Force. The Task Force submitted its
report in August 2006. It was announced in
the Union Budget 2008-09 that the
Government of India and the State
Governments have reached an agreement
on the content of the package for the revival
of the long-term co-operative credit
structure. The cost of the package has been
estimated at Rs.3,074 crore, of which the
Central Government’s share will be
Rs.2,642 crore. The Government of
India has constituted a Task Force
(Chairman: Shri G. C. Chaturvedi) in
September 2009 with representatives from
the Reserve Bank and the NABARD to look
into the various aspects of the long-term
co-operative credit structure with regard to

Amalgamation of RRBs: Status
134. Of the total number of 196 RRBs,
159 RRBs have been amalgamated into 46
new RRBs (sponsored by 27 banks and
located in 26 States including one Union
Territory). Since then one new RRB has
also been established in the Union Territory
of Puducherry. Accordingly, the total
number of RRBs now functioning is 84.
Recapitalisation of RRBs: Status
135
The Union Budget 2007-08
announced that RRBs which have a
negative net worth will be recapitalised in
38

a phased manner. The process of
recapitalisation has since been completed
with 27 RRBs having been fully
recapitalised with an amount of Rs.1,796
crore as on July 31, 2009.

existing instructions on internal control,
risk management system, asset-liability
management (ALM) and disclosure norms
as appropriate to UCBs as also to apply
capital charge for market risk in respect of
large-sized and systemically important
UCBs. The review is underway.

Technology Upgradation of RRBs: Status
136. With a view to enabling RRBs to
adopt information technology (IT)-based
solutions for financial inclusion, it was
proposed in the Annual Policy Statement
of April 2009 to work out, in consultation
with the NABARD, the manner of providing
assistance to RRBs for adopting information
and communication technology (ICT)
solutions for financial inclusion in districts
identified as having high level of exclusion
by the Committee on Financial Inclusion
(Chairman: Dr. C. Rangarajan). To facilitate
ICT implementation, there is a need to
implement core banking solutions (CBS). In
this context, the Report of the internal
Working Group (Chairman: Shri G.
Srinivasan) constituted by the Reserve
Bank to prepare a roadmap for migration
to CBS by RRBs was forwarded to all
sponsor banks in October 2008 with an
advice to implement the recommendations
in respect of RRBs sponsored by them. The
issue of sharing the funding cost of CBS
project among the owners of RRBs, viz.,
the Government of India, the State
Governments and sponsor banks, is under
examination by the NABARD.

Information Technology Support to
UCBs: Status
138. Based on the recommendations of
the Working Group (Chairman: Shri R.
Gandhi), which looked into ways of
supporting IT initiatives of the UCBs, a
tentative action plan has been worked out.
Taking into account a large number of small
and unit UCBs and the lack of uniformity
in the level of computerisation, the action
plan envisages the minimum level of IT
infrastructure to include computerised
management information system (MIS)
reporting and automated regulatory
reporting (ARR). After a series of
discussions with service providers, it has
been decided to adopt the application
service provider (ASP) model for providing
IT support to UCBs. The modalities are
being worked out in consultation with the
Institute for Development and Research in
Banking Technology (IDRBT).
Creation of Umbrella Organisation and
Revival Fund for UCBs: Status
139. As indicated in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2008, a Working Group
(Chairman: Shri V. S. Das) was constituted
to suggest measures, including the
appropriate regulatory and supervisory
framework, to facilitate emergence of
umbrella organisation(s) for the UCB sector

Urban Co-operative Banks
Review of Regulatory and Supervisory
Framework for UCBs: Status

since submitted its Report.

2007. However, in those cases, where
proposals for amalgamation within the UCB
sector are not forthcoming, it is proposed:

DICGC-Supported Transfer of Assets
and Liabilities of UCBs to Commercial
Banks in Legacy Cases

•

140.
As a part of the measures to
strengthen the urban co-operative banking
system, a scheme of amalgamation of weak
UCBs with strong UCBs, with support from
the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee
Corporation (DICGC), is considered by the
Reserve Bank in cases involving UCBs
having negative net worth as on March 31,

to provide DICGC support to the scheme
involving transfer of assets and liabilities
(including branches) of legacy cases of
urban co-operative banks to domestic
scheduled commercial banks, provided the
scheme ensures 100 per cent protection
to depositors and DICGC support is
restricted to the amount as provided under
Section 16 (2) of the DICGC Act, 1961.

141.
Detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued separately.

V. Financial Inclusion
who own petrol pumps; (v) retired
teachers; and (vi) authorised functionaries
of well-run self-help groups (SHGs)
linked to banks; and

Business Correspondent (BC) Model
142.
As proposed in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009, a Working Group
(Chairman: Shri P. Vijaya Bhaskar) was
constituted to examine the experience
gained to date with the business
correspondent (BC) model and to suggest
measures to enlarge the category of persons
that can act as BCs, keeping in view the
regulatory and supervisory framework and
consumer protection issues. The Group’s
Report has been placed on the Reserve
Bank’s website. Based on the Group’s
recommendations, it is proposed:

•

•

to allow banks to collect reasonable
service charges from the customer in a
transparent manner under their Boardapproved policy for delivering the
services through BC. This should be
clearly explained to the customer.

143.
Based on the experience gained,
the working of the scheme will be reviewed
after one year.
Pilot Project of SLBCs for 100 per cent
Financial Inclusion

to allow banks to appoint the following
entities as BCs in addition to those
permitted already: (i) individual
kirana/medical/fair price shop owners;
(ii) individual public call office (PCO)
operators; (iii) agents of small savings
schemes of Government of India/
insurance companies; (iv) individuals

144.
Of the total of 623 districts in the
country, 431 districts have so far been
identified for 100 per cent financial
inclusion. Of these, 204 districts in 18
States and six Union Territories have
reported having achieved the target. All
40

districts of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,
Karnataka, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Goa,
Chandigarh, Puducherry, Daman & Diu,
Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Lakshdweep
have reported having achieved 100 per cent
financial inclusion. The Reserve Bank had
undertaken an evaluation study through
external agencies in 26 districts of eight
States claiming 100 per cent financial
inclusion, to draw lessons for further action.
The study reports had, inter alia, revealed
that although the SLBCs had declared
several districts as 100 per cent financially
included, the actual financial inclusion was
short of that. A large number of no-frills
accounts are dormant, the number of
transactions is small and ICT- based
financial services are yet to reach many
villages. The findings of the study were
communicated to banks in January 2009
with an advice to take appropriate action.

centres have been allotted to three public
sector banks. Action has also been initiated
in respect of other States in the region.
Quicker Adoption of Electronic Benefit
Transfer (EBT) for Government
Schemes
146.
To encourage banks to adopt ICT
solutions for enhancing their outreach, the
Reserve Bank formulated a scheme to
quicken the pace of adoption of the smart
card-based electronic benefit transfer (EBT)
mechanism by banks and rolled out the EBT
system in the States that are ready to adopt
the scheme. As per the scheme, the Reserve
Bank would reimburse the banks a part of
the cost of opening accounts with bio-metric
access/smart cards at the rate of Rs.50 per
account through which payment of social
security benefits, National Rural Employment
Guarantee Act (NREGA) payments and
payments under other Government benefit
programmes would be routed to persons
belonging to below poverty line (BPL)
families. The scheme is currently being
implemented in Andhra Pradesh. So far,
seven banks have been paid Rs.1.8 crore for
smart cards issued by banks in Andhra
Pradesh during July-December 2008. The
process is at different stages of
implementation in other States such as
Karnataka and Uttarakhand and the scheme
of partial reimbursement by the Reserve
Bank has been extended by one year up to
June 30, 2010. Banks are advised to work
in co-ordination with the respective
government departments at the Central and
State levels to ensure that all State benefits
are delivered to individuals only through
bank accounts within a specific timeframe.

Special Task Force in North-Eastern
Region
145. The Annual Policy Statement of
April 2009 had indicated the formulation
of a scheme of providing financial support
to banks by the Reserve Bank for setting
up banking facilities at centres in the
North-Eastern region which were found to
be commercially viable by banks, provided
the State Governments made available
necessary premises and other infrastructural
support. As its contribution, the Reserve
Bank would bear one-time capital cost and
recurring expenses for a limited period of
five years as per the lowest bid offered by
a bank. The Government of Meghalaya has
since agreed to the proposal of providing
premises and security. Accordingly, eight

High Level Committee on
Lead Bank Scheme

including repeat loans to existing SHGs, to
the tune of Rs.12,254 crore. There were 6.1
million savings accounts of SHGs with
banks as on March 31, 2009 with total
deposits amounting to Rs.5,546 crore.

147. The High Level Committee on Lead
Bank Scheme (Chairperson: Smt. Usha Thorat)
submitted its draft report on May 21, 2009.
The Report was placed on the Reserve
Bank’s website inviting comments from
public and other stakeholders. Based on the
feedback received, the Committee
submitted its final report to the Reserve
Bank on August 20, 2009 and the report
was placed on the Reserve Bank’s website
on August 24, 2009. While the
recommendations of the Committee are
under consideration, it is proposed:

•

149. The role of micro-finance institutions
(MFIs) in providing financial services to the
poor is growing in importance. The banking
sector has been extending loans to MFIs
for on-lending to SHGs. During 2008-09,
bank loans amounting to Rs.3,732 crore
were disbursed to 581 MFIs, increasing the
total outstanding loans to Rs.5,009 crore to
1,915 MFIs as on March 31, 2009.
Priority Sector Lending Certificates
(PSLCs): Working Group

to advise the lead banks to constitute a
Sub-Committee of the District
Consultative Committees (DCCs) to
draw up a roadmap by March 2010 to
provide banking services through a
banking outlet in every village having a
population of over 2,000, by March
2011. Such banking services may not
necessarily be extended through a
brick and mortar branch but can be
provided through any of the various
forms of ICT- based models, including
through BCs.

150. The Committee on Financial
Sector Reforms (Chairman: Dr. Raghuram
G. Rajan), inter alia, recommended
introduction of priority sector lending
certificates (PSLCs) for purchase by banks
for achieving the priority sector lending
target. According to the Committee’s
recommendation, PSLCs would be issued
by registered lenders such as MFIs,
NBFCs, co-operatives, and registered
money lenders for the amount of loans
granted by them to the priority sector, and
also by banks for the amounts in excess of
their stipulated priority sector lending
requirements. These certificates could be
traded in the open market, and banks
having shortfall in meeting the priority
sector lending targets could buy such
certificates and thus meet the priority
sector lending norms. The Committee
further recommended that in the trading of
PSLCs, the actual loans would continue to
remain on the books of the original lender

Micro-finance: Status
148. The self-help group (SHG)-bank
linkage programme has emerged as the
major micro-finance programme in the
country and is being implemented by
commercial banks, RRBs and co-operative
banks. As on March 31, 2009, 4.2 million
SHGs were operating with an outstanding
bank credit of Rs.22,680 crore, up by 34
per cent over March 31, 2008. During
2008-09, banks financed 1.6 million SHGs,
42

151.
Preliminary discussions indicated
that there are both merits and demerits of
the proposal. Therefore, it is proposed:

unlike in outright purchase of loan assets.
However, the buyer bank would show the
amount in its priority sector lending
requirements. The seller of PSLC, if it is a
bank, will take it off its priority sector
lending requirements even though it will
continue to carry the loan on its books.

•

to constitute a Working Group to examine
the issues involved in the introduction
of priority sector lending certificates
and make suitable recommendations.

VI. Regulatory Measures for Commercial Banks
manner that at least one-third of such
branches are in the underbanked districts
of underbanked States as will be notified
separately by the Reserve Bank. This
would be one of the criteria in the Reserve
Bank’s consideration of proposals by
domestic scheduled commercial banks
(other than RRBs) to open branches in
Tier 1 and Tier 2 centres. In considering
such proposals, the Reserve Bank would,
in addition, take into account banks’
performance in financial inclusion,
priority sector lending and level of
customer service, among others.

Relaxations in Branch Authorisation
Policy
152.
As announced in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009, a Working Group
(Chairman: Shri P. Vijaya Bhaskar) was
constituted to review the extant branch
authorisation policy with a view to
providing greater flexibility to banks for
opening branches to enhance banking
penetration and promote financial
inclusion. The Group has since submitted
its report. Taking into consideration the
Group’s recommendations, it is proposed
to liberalise the extant branch authorisation
policy for domestic scheduled commercial
banks (other than RRBs) as under:

•

Domestic scheduled commercial banks
(other than RRBs) will now be free to
open branches in Tier 3 to Tier 6 centres
as identified in the Census 2001 (with
population up to 50,000) under general
permission.

•

Opening of branches by domestic
scheduled commercial banks (other
than RRBs) in Tier 1 and Tier 2 centres
(with population over 50,000) will
continue to require prior authorisation.

•

Banks may plan their branch expansion
in Tier 3 to Tier 6 centres in such a

Enhancements to the Basel II
Framework
153.
In July 2009, the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision (BCBS) had finalised
enhancements and revisions in certain areas
of the Basel II framework. The enhanced/
revised guidance of BCBS is contained in
their three documents, viz., Enhancements to
the Basel II Framework; Revisions to the
Basel II Market Risk Framework; and
Guidelines for Computing Capital Charge for
Incremental Risk in the Trading Book. These
enhancements and revisions are intended to
strengthen the framework and respond to
lessons learnt from the financial crisis.
43

154.
The enhancements and revisions
now stipulated by BCBS are, however,
mostly applicable to advanced approaches
of the Basel II framework. Banks in India
have implemented standardised/basic
approaches contained in the framework.
However, wherever those enhancements and
revisions are applicable to standardised/basic
approaches, it is proposed:

•

of their interest rate risk. With this move,
banks would migrate to the application of
the ‘economic value perspective’ to interest
rate risk management. Accordingly, it is
proposed:

•

to issue detailed guidelines as appropriate
for implementation by banks operating
in India by end-November 2009.

to issue detailed guidelines on the use
of DGA for management of interest rate
risk by end-November 2009 .

Review of Capital Adequacy Norms
for Take-out Financing
156. At present, the credit conversion
factor (CCF) for off-balance sheet exposure
of the take-out financing institution, which
captures that institution’s unconditional
commitment during the period up to the
take-out event, is 100 per cent. The CCF
for conditional take-out has been fixed at a
lower level of 50 per cent reflecting the
uncertainty regarding the take-out event due
to the conditional nature of the agreement.
The existing capital adequacy treatment of
take-out financing is in conformity with the
capital adequacy treatment of forward asset
purchases under both Basel I and Basel II.
The issue has been reconsidered and it is
proposed:

Introduction of Duration Gap Analysis
for Asset Liability Management
155.
The Reserve Bank had issued
guidelines on asset liability management in
February 1999, which, inter alia, covered
aspects relating to interest rate risk
measurement. These guidelines to banks
approached interest rate risk measurement
from the ‘earnings perspective’ using the
traditional gap analysis (TGA). To begin
with, the TGA was considered as a suitable
method to measure interest rate risk. The
Reserve Bank had, however, indicated its
intention to shift to modern techniques of
interest rate risk measurement such as
duration gap analysis (DGA), simulation
and value-at-risk over a period of time,
when banks acquire sufficient expertise and
sophistication in this regard. Since banks
have gained considerable experience in
implementation of the TGA and have
become familiar with the application of the
concept of duration/modified duration
while applying standardised duration
method for measurement of interest rate risk
in the trading book, this is an opportune time
for banks to adopt the DGA for management

•

to allow banks to build up capital for
take-out exposures in a phased manner.

157.
Detailed guidelines in this regard
are being issued separately.
Commercial Real Estate Exposures
158. In view of large increase in credit
to the commercial real estate sector over
the last one year and the extent of
restructured advances in this sector, it
would be prudent to build cushion against
44

likely non-performing assets (NPAs).
Accordingly, it is proposed:

•

non-deposit taking NBFCs (NBFCs-ND-SI)
is 100 per cent. However, asset finance
companies (AFCs) within the NBFCs-ND-SI
category carry a risk weight based on credit
ratings. As indicated in para 178 in Section
VII of this part, NBFCs engaged in financing
of infrastructure would henceforth be
classified in a new category called
infrastructure NBFCs. Since financing by
such NBFCs would essentially result in the
creation of physical infrastructure, it is
proposed:

to increase the provisioning requirement
for advances to the commercial real
estate sector classified as ‘standard
assets’ from the present level of 0.40 per
cent to 1 per cent.

Review of Adequacy of Loan Loss
Provisions
159.
At present, the provisioning
requirements for NPAs range between 10 per
cent and 100 per cent of the outstanding
amount, depending on the age of the NPAs,
the security available and the internal policy
of the bank. Since the rates of provisioning
stipulated by the Reserve Bank for NPAs are
the minimum and banks can make additional
provisions subject to a consistent policy
based on riskiness of their credit portfolios,
it has been observed that there is a wide
heterogeneity and variance in the level of
provisioning coverage ratio across different
banks. With a view to improving the
provisioning cover and enhancing the
soundness of individual banks, it is
proposed:

•

•

to link the risk weights of banks’
exposure to such NBFCs to the credit
rating assigned to the NBFC by external
credit assessment institutions (ECAIs).

Lock-in Period and Minimum Retention
for Securitisation Exposures
161.
To ensure that the originators do not
compromise on due diligence of assets
generated for the purpose of securitisation,
it was proposed in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009 to stipulate a
minimum lock-in period for bank loans
before these were securitised. It was also
proposed to lay down minimum retention
criteria for the originators as another
measure to achieve the same objective.
Accordingly, it is proposed:

to advise banks to augment their
provisioning cushions consisting of
specific provisions against NPAs as well
as floating provisions, and ensure that
their total provisioning coverage ratio,
including floating provisions, is not less
than 70 per cent. Banks should achieve
this norm not later than end-September
2010.

Banks’ Exposure to NBFCs Engaged
in Infrastructure Financing: Review
of Risk Weights

•

that the minimum lock-in period for all
types of loans would be one year before
these can be securitised; and

•

that the minimum retention by the
originators will be 10 per cent of the pool
of assets being securitised.

162.
The international work, especially
in the European Union and the US
regarding the minimum retention criteria,
is still underway. The Reserve Bank will

At present, the risk weight for
banks’ exposure to systemically important

adopting the integrating risk management
system, it is now proposed:

issue detailed guidelines on the manner of
computation of the one year lock-in period
and other operational details keeping in
view the international norms being
developed.

•

to issue a draft circular reflecting these
changes by end-December 2009.

Stress Testing
Compensation Practices

165.
The Annual Policy Statement of
April 2009 proposed upgradation of the
stress testing guidelines once BCBS
finalises the paper on ‘Principles for Sound
Stress Testing Practices and Supervision’.
In this context, the guidelines issued to
banks in June 2007 are required to be
enhanced in the light of the final paper
issued by BCBS and taking into account
international work/initiatives in the area of
stress testing, particularly that being done
by the IMF and the FSB. It is proposed:

163.
Compensation practices, especially
of large financial institutions, were one of
the factors which contributed to the recent
global financial crisis. The FSB has
brought out certain principles for sound
compensation practices. The principles call
for effective governance of compensation,
and for compensation to be adjusted for all
types of risk, to be symmetric with risk
outcomes, and to be sensitive to the time
horizon of risks. These principles, which
have been endorsed by the G-20, should be
the guiding tenets for devising compensation
schemes for all employees in a financial
institution. The Reserve Bank is working
on the FSB principles for sound
compensation and it is proposed:

•

•

to issue guidelines to banks on stress
testing by end-January 2010.

Credit Rating Agencies: Status
166.
It was indicated in the Annual
Policy Statement of April 2009 that the
Reserve Bank will liaise with the SEBI on
the issue of rating agencies’ adherence to
Code of Conduct Fundamentals of the
International Organisation of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO). Accordingly, in
order to review rating agencies’ continued
accreditation under Basel II, the Reserve
Bank conducted meetings with Credit
Rating Information Services of India Ltd.
(CRISIL), ICRA Ltd., Credit Analysis and
Research Ltd. (CARE) and Fitch. The
Reserve Bank has also initiated
discussions with the SEBI to assess the
rating agencies’ compliance with the
enhanced Code of Conduct Fundamentals
of the IOSCO.

to issue suitable guidelines to private
sector and foreign banks with regard to
sound compensation policies.

Liquidity Risk
164.
The Annual Policy Statement of
April 2009 proposed to place the draft
circular on liquidity risk management, as
also the guidance note on “Liquidity Risk
Management” on the Reserve Bank’s
website by mid-June 2009. This was
deferred. Keeping in view active discussions
underway at the global level on liquidity
risk management as the BCBS is also in
the process of enhancing the modalities for
46

VII. Institutional Developments
regarding debit of their accounts even though
ATMs had not disbursed cash for various
reasons. In order to improve customer
service, the Reserve Bank advised all banks
to reimburse to the customers the amount
wrongfully debited on account of failed ATM
transactions within a maximum period of 12
days from the date of receipt of customer
complaint. In case a bank fails to re-credit
the customer’s account, it is required to pay
compensation of Rs.100 per day to the
aggrieved customer. The amount of
compensation is credited to the customer’s
account on the same day the bank credits
the amount of the failed ATM transaction.

Payment and Settlement Systems
Guidelines for Pre-paid Payment
Instruments in India
167.
As indicated in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009, SCBs and non-bank
entities, which complied with the eligibility
criteria, were permitted to issue pre-paid
payment instruments. Furthermore, in
August 2009, other entities were also
permitted to issue mobile phone based
semi-closed system pre-paid instruments for
a maximum value of Rs.5,000.
Electronic Payment Systems
168. Between end-March 2009 and
end-September 2009, the branch network
of national electronic funds transfer (NEFT)
enabled banks increased from 54,200 to
60,839 and the RTGS enabled branches
increased from 55,000 to 60,144. The
average number of daily transactions
handled by the RTGS network increased
from 80,000 to 90,000.

Facility to Use ATMs of other Banks:
Rationalisation
171.
The Reserve Bank had advised that
customers could use the ATMs of other
banks for cash withdrawal free of charge
with effect from April 1, 2009. This led to a
quantum increase in ATM transactions,
especially small value cash withdrawal
transactions, which tended to impair the
viability of operations. The Indian Banks’
Association (IBA), therefore, approached the
Reserve Bank with suggestions to rationalise
the facility in order to achieve a balance
between optimising customer convenience
and mitigating operational difficulties.
Taking into account all the relevant issues,
the Reserve Bank agreed to the IBA’s
suggestions of: (i) extending the access of
ATMs of other banks to only customers
having savings bank accounts; (ii) pegging
a cap of Rs.10,000 per withdrawal at ATMs
of other banks; and (iii) permitting only five
free transactions per month at ATMs of other

National Electronic Clearing Service
169.
As indicated in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009, the volume of
transactions through national electronic
clearing service (NECS), introduced in
September 2008, is gradually increasing. As
at end-September 2009, 114 banks with
30,780 branches have been participating in
NECS.
Customer Service at ATMs
170.
The Reserve Bank received a
number of complaints from bank customers

cards, cash withdrawals up to Rs.1,000 per
day at POS terminals have been allowed for
all debit cards issued in India.

banks. These instructions came into effect
from October 15, 2009.
Mobile Payments

The Payment and Settlement Systems
Act, 2007

172.
With the issuance of the operative
guidelines for mobile payments on October
8, 2008, the Reserve Bank has so far
granted approval to 32 banks to provide
mobile banking facilities to their customers.

175.
As indicated in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2009, all payment
system providers/operators, including
credit card issuing companies and entities
engaged in money transfer activity, require
authorisation as per the Payment and
Settlement Systems Act, 2007. Accordingly,
30 payment system service providers
providing service in India have been
granted certificate of authorisation by the
Reserve Bank by end-September 2009.

Cheque Truncation System
173.
The Annual Policy Statement of
April 2009 indicated that the Reserve Bank
will continue to take steps towards extending
the cheque truncation system (CTS) across
the country. In pursuance of this, effective
July 1, 2009, all cheque volumes at New
Delhi migrated to CTS and accordingly
magnetic ink character recognition (MICR)
clearing (both at SBI and the Reserve Bank)
was discontinued. Furthermore, action to
roll-out CTS at Chennai has been initiated
and it is proposed that New Delhi and
Chennai would act as backup for each other.
With effect from July 1, 2009, a fee of
Rs.0.50 per instrument each from the
presenting bank and from the paying bank
in the CTS has been introduced. Presently,
CTS is handling around 6,00,000 instruments
every day.

Currency Management
176.
The High Level Group on Currency
Management (Chairperson: Smt Usha
Thorat) constituted by the Reserve Bank
submitted its Report in August 2009. The
Group has, inter alia, emphasised the
importance of using modern technology and
security systems for stocking, processing
and distribution of currency to ensure
adequate availability of genuine and clean
notes to the public. With a view to
encouraging banks for giving due priority
to the above objective, it is proposed:

Cash Withdrawal at Point-of-Sale (POS)
174.
Cash is predominantly used for
small value payments and as such there is
always a need for availability of currency.
The use of debit cards at point-of-sale
(POS) terminals at different merchant
establishments has been steadily on the rise.
The number of POS terminals in the country
at the end of August 2009 was 4,87,024.
As a further step towards enhancing
customer convenience in using plastic
48

•

to mandate banks to install note sorting
machines in all their branches in a
phased manner in terms of a roadmap
to be approved by the Reserve Bank; and

•

to have the responsibility of currency
management entrusted to a nodal official
in each bank, who shall be a senior
functionary at a level not less than that
of a General Manager and who will be
accountable for the obligations cast upon
currency chests by the Reserve Bank.

borrower which will be legally enforceable.
Accordingly, NBFCs were advised the
broad framework in respect of terms and
conditions of the contract/loan agreement,
viz., (i) notice period before taking
possession; (ii) circumstances under which
the notice period can be waived; (iii) the
procedure for taking possession of the
security; (iv) a provision regarding final
chance to be given to the borrower for
repayment of loan before the sale/auction of
the property; (v) the procedure for giving
repossession to the borrower; and (vi) the
procedure for sale/auction of the property.
Furthermore, NBFCs were urged to make
available a copy of such terms and conditions
to the borrowers at the time of sanction/
disbursement of loans, which may form a
key component of such contracts/loan
agreements.

177.
Detailed guidelines based on the
report of the Working Group are being
issued separately.
Non-Banking Financial Companies
Classification of NBFCs-ND-SI:
Infrastructure Companies
178. NBFCs-ND-SI engaged predominantly
in the infrastructure financing have
represented to the Reserve Bank that there
should be a separate category of
infrastructure financing NBFCs in view of
the critical role played by them in providing
credit to the infrastructure sector. Currently,
the Reserve Bank classifies NBFCs under
three categories, viz., asset finance
companies, loan companies and investment
companies. It has now been decided to:

•

introduce a fourth category of NBFCs
as ‘infrastructure NBFCs’, defined as
entities which hold minimum of 75 per
cent of their total assets for financing
infrastructure projects.

Special Liquidity Facility for Eligible
NBFCs-ND-SI
181.
The special liquidity facility for
eligible NBFCs-ND-SI for meeting the
temporary liquidity mismatches through the
Industrial Development Bank of India
Stressed Asset Stabilisation Fund (IDBI
SASF) Trust, which was notified as a special
purpose vehicle (SPV) for undertaking the
operation, was extended for eligible papers
issued by NBFCs up to September 30, 2009.
The SPV will cease to make fresh purchases
after December 31, 2009 and will recover
all dues by March 31, 2010. The facility
was availed of to the extent of Rs.750 crore
and was repaid fully by July 7, 2009.

179.
Detailed instructions, including
eligibility criteria, are being issued separately.
Repossession of Vehicles by NBFCs
180.
The Annual Policy Statement of
April 2009 had emphasised that NBFCs
should have a built-in repossession clause
(in respect of repossession of vehicles) and
also detailed provisions with regard to terms
and conditions for ensuring transparency in
the contract/loan agreement with the
