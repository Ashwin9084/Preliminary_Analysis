Second Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2019-20
Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
Reserve Bank of India
On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the
Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today decided to:
•

reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points
to 5.75 per cent from 6.0 per cent with immediate effect.

Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.50 per cent, and the marginal
standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.0 per cent.
The MPC also decided to change the stance of monetary policy from neutral to accommodative.
These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for
consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting
growth.
The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.
Assessment
Global Economy
2.
Global economic activity has been losing pace after a somewhat improved performance in
Q1:2019, reflecting further slowdown in trade and manufacturing activity. Among advanced
economies (AEs), economic activity in the US strengthened in Q1, supported by higher government
spending, increase in private investment and a lower trade deficit. However, factory activity and retail
sales moderated in April. Economic activity in the Euro area has remained weak due to muted
industrial activity and weak business confidence. Leading indicators point to a further slowdown in the
Euro area in Q2. In the UK, GDP growth for Q1 picked up on high retail sales and government
expenditure. However, the outlook is clouded by uncertainty relating to Brexit. The Japanese economy
accelerated in Q1 on net exports gains and increased public investment. In April, industrial production
improved, while retail sales fell.
3.
Economic activity has slowed in many emerging market economies (EMEs). In Q1:2019, the
Chinese economy grew at the same pace as in the previous quarter, though slightly above consensus
expectations. However, incoming data on industrial production and retail sales suggest that the growth
momentum may weaken in Q2. The Russian economy, which had shown some signs of recovery in
Q4:2018, weakened in Q1 on muted domestic activity and trade. Economic activity in South Africa
contracted in Q1 pulled down mainly by a sharp decline in manufacturing activity. Brazil’s economy
contracted in Q1 for the first time since 2016 and there are fears that it could return to recession.

2
4.
Crude oil prices remained volatile, reflecting evolving demand-supply conditions underpinned
by the production stance of the OPEC plus, rising shale output, weakening global demand and geopolitical concerns. The strengthening of the US dollar had weakened gold prices; however, prices
picked up since the last week of May on escalating trade tensions, reviving its demand as a safe haven
asset. Inflation remains below target in several economies, though it has shown an uptick since March.
5.
Financial markets have been driven by uncertainties surrounding US-China trade negotiations
and Brexit. In the US, the equity market has experienced some selling pressures since early May on
escalation of trade tensions with China and recently, with Mexico. Equity markets in most EMEs have
lost steam due to the waning risk appetite on rising geo-political uncertainties and weakening global
trade prospects. Bond yields in the US picked up in April on better GDP data for Q1, but declined in
May on subdued economic data and expectations of a dovish monetary policy stance. Bond yields in
Germany slipped into negative territory on weak economic data; in Japan, they remained negative on
indications of sustained accommodation. In many EMEs, bond yields have been falling with central
banks adopting accommodative monetary policy to boost economic growth. In currency markets, the
US dollar strengthened on better than expected domestic economic data for Q1. Most EME currencies
have depreciated against the US dollar.
Domestic Economy
6.
Turning to the domestic economy, on May 31, 2019 the National Statistical Office (NSO)
released quarterly estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) for Q4:2018-19 and provisional
estimates of national income for 2018-19. GDP growth for 2018-19 has been estimated at 6.8 per cent
year-on-year (y-o-y), down by 20 basis points from the second advance estimates released on February
28, pulled down by a downward revision in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) and
moderation in exports. Quarterly data show that domestic economic activity decelerated sharply to 5.8
per cent in Q4:2018-19 from 6.6 per cent in Q3 and 8.1 per cent in Q4:2017-18. Gross fixed capital
formation (GFCF) growth declined sharply to 3.6 per cent, after remaining in double digits in the
previous five quarters. Private consumption growth also moderated. The drag on aggregate demand
from net exports increased in Q4 due to a sharper deceleration in exports relative to imports. However,
the overall slowdown in growth was cushioned by a large increase in government final consumption
expenditure (GFCE).
7.
On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities contracted, albeit marginally, in Q4:201819 due to a decline in rabi production. According to the third advance estimates, foodgrains
production at 283.4 million tonnes for 2018-19 was lower by 0.6 per cent compared with the previous
year mainly due to lower production of rabi rice, pulses and coarse cereals. However, there has been a
catch-up in foodgrains production relative to earlier estimates. Foodgrains stocks at 72.6 million
tonnes as on May 16, 2019 were 3.4 times the prescribed buffer norms. Growth in manufacturing
activity weakened sharply to 3.1 per cent from 6.4 per cent in the previous quarter. Service sector
growth, however, accelerated, supported by financial, real estate and professional services, and public
administration, defence and other services. In contrast, construction activity slowed down markedly.
8.
Moving beyond Q4, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that south-west
monsoon rainfall (June to September) is likely to be normal at 96 per cent of the long period average
(LPA). The current weak El Niño conditions over the Pacific are likely to continue during the
monsoon. However, currently prevailing neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions may turn
positive in the middle of the monsoon season and persist thereafter, which augur well for the rainfall
outlook.
9.
Growth in eight core industries decelerated sharply in April, pulled down largely by coal,
crude oil, fertilisers and cement. Credit flows from banks to large industries strengthened, though they
remained muted for micro, small and medium industries. Based on early results of the Reserve Bank’s
order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), capacity utilisation (CU) in the
manufacturing sector improved to 77 per cent in Q4 from 75.9 per cent in Q3; seasonally adjusted CU,
however, slipped marginally to 75.2 per cent in Q4 from 75.8 per cent in Q3. The business assessment
index (BAI) of the industrial outlook survey (IOS) in Q1:2019-20 remained unchanged at its level in
the previous quarter. Imports of capital goods – a key indicator of investment activity – remained

3
anaemic in April. However, the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) edged up to 52.7 in
May with strengthening of output, new orders and employment.
10.
High frequency indicators suggest moderation in activity in the service sector. Sales of
commercial vehicles, tractors, passenger cars, and three and two wheelers contracted in April. Railway
freight traffic growth decelerated. Domestic air passenger traffic growth contracted in March, but
turned around modestly in April. Two key indicators of construction activity, viz., cement production
and steel consumption, slowed down in April. The PMI services index moderated to 50.2 in May on
subdued growth of new businesses.
11.
Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in CPI, remained unchanged in April, at its March
level of 2.9 per cent, with higher inflation in food and fuel groups being offset by lower inflation in
items excluding food and fuel.
12.
The April food inflation print showed an increase to 1.4 per cent from 0.7 per cent in March.
Within the food group, vegetables moved out of nine months of deflation. However, three sub-groups,
viz., fruits, pulses and sugar, remained in deflation in April, though the extent of deflation moderated.
Among other food sub-groups, inflation in prices of milk, oils and fats, spices, non-alcoholic
beverages and prepared meals moderated, while inflation in meat, fish and eggs prices ticked up.
13.
Inflation in the fuel and light group rose to 2.6 per cent in April from the February trough of
1.2 per cent, pulled up by prices of liquified petroleum gas due to an increase in international prices.
Inflation in subsidised kerosene also rose, reflecting the impact of the calibrated increase in its
administered price. Electricity prices moved out of three months of deflation in April. Prices of rural
fuel consumption items – firewood, chips and dung cake – moved into deflation.
14.
CPI inflation excluding food and fuel fell sharply to 4.5 per cent in April from 5.1 per cent in
March – the largest monthly decline since April 2017. The moderation in inflation was broad-based,
with household goods and services, and personal care and effects sub-groups registering the largest fall
in April; housing inflation was the lowest since June 2017, reflecting softening in house rents in urban
areas. Inflation in clothing and footwear also touched its historical low in the new all-India CPI series.
Inflation in education, health and transportation and communication moderated as well.
15.
Inflation expectations of households in the May 2019 round of Reserve Bank’s survey
declined by 20 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon compared with the previous round, but
remained unchanged for the one-year ahead horizon. However, manufacturing firms participating in
the Reserve Bank’s industrial outlook survey expect input cost pressures to intensify on account of
higher raw material costs and salaries in Q2. Input price pressures eased in both agricultural and
industrial raw materials. Nominal growth in rural wages and in organised sector staff costs remained
muted.
16.
Liquidity in the system turned into an average daily surplus of ₹66,000 crore (₹660 billion) in
early June after remaining in deficit during April and most of May due to restrained government
spending. The Reserve Bank injected liquidity of ₹70,000 crore (₹700 billion) in April and ₹33,400
crore (₹334 billion) in May on a daily net average basis under the LAF. It conducted two OMO
purchase auctions in May amounting to ₹25,000 crore (₹250 billion) and a US dollar buy/sell swap
auction of US$ 5 billion (₹34,874 crore) for a tenor of 3 years in April to inject durable liquidity into
the system. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) – the operating target of monetary policy
– remained broadly aligned with the policy repo rate: it traded above the policy repo rate (on an
average) by 6 bps in April, but below the policy repo rate by 6 bps in May. The Reserve Bank has
announced that it would conduct an OMO purchase auction of ₹15,000 crore (₹150 billion) on June
13, 2019.
17.
Transmission of the cumulative reduction of 50 bps in the policy repo rate in February and
April 2019 was 21 bps to the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans. However,
the WALR on outstanding rupee loans increased by 4 bps as the past loans continue to be priced at
high rates. Interest rates on longer tenor money market instruments remained broadly aligned with the
overnight WACR, reflecting near full transmission of the reduction in policy rate.

18.
Exports were unable to sustain the growth of 11.8 per cent observed in March 2019; they grew
by 0.6 per cent in April 2019 dragged down by engineering goods, gems and jewellery, and leather
products. Imports grew at a somewhat accelerated pace in April 2019 relative to the preceding month,
driven by imports of petroleum (crude and products), gold and machinery. This led to a widening of
the trade deficit, both sequentially and on a y-o-y basis. Provisional data suggest that net services
exports in Q4:2018-19 were broadly comparable to their level a year ago which bode well for the
current account balance. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment flows were stronger in
Q4:2018-19 than a year ago. After a sharp recovery in March 2019, net foreign portfolio inflows were
relatively modest at US$ 2.3 billion in 2019-20 in April-May. While the equity segment received net
inflows during this period, the debt segment witnessed net outflows. India’s foreign exchange reserves
were at US$ 421.9 billion on May 31, 2019.
Outlook
19.
In the bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of April 2019, CPI inflation was projected at 2.4
per cent for Q4:2018-19, 2.9-3.0 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 3.5-3.8 per cent for H2:2019-20, with
risks broadly balanced. The headline inflation outcome in Q4 at 2.5 per cent was largely in alignment
with the April policy projections.
20.
The baseline inflation trajectory for 2019-20 is shaped by several factors. First, the summer
pick-up in vegetable prices has been sharper than expected, though this may be accompanied by a
correspondingly larger reversal during autumn and winter. More recent information also suggests a
broad-based pick-up in prices in several food items. This has imparted an upward bias to the nearterm trajectory of food inflation. Second, a significant weakening of domestic and external demand
conditions appear to have led to a sharp broad-based decline of 60 bps in inflation excluding food and
fuel in April; this has imparted a downward bias to the inflation trajectory for the rest of the year.
Third, crude prices have continued to be volatile. However, its impact on CPI inflation has been muted
so far due to incomplete pass-through. Fourth, near-term inflation expectations of households have
continued to moderate. Taking into consideration these factors, the impact of recent policy rate cuts
and expectations of a normal monsoon in 2019, the path of CPI inflation is revised to 3.0-3.1 per cent
for H1:2019-20 and to 3.4-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).
21.
Risks around the baseline inflation trajectory emanate from uncertainties relating to the
monsoon, unseasonal spikes in vegetable prices, international fuel prices and their pass-through to
domestic prices, geo-political tensions, financial market volatility and the fiscal scenario.
22.
In the April policy, GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected at 7.2 per cent – in the range of
6.8-7.1 per cent for H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent for H2 – with risks evenly balanced. Data for Q4:2018-19
indicate that domestic investment activity has weakened and overall demand has been weighed down
partly by slowing exports. Weak global demand due to escalation in trade wars may further impact
India’s exports and investment activity. Further, private consumption, especially in rural areas, has
weakened in recent months. However, on the positive side, political stability, high capacity utilisation,
the uptick in business expectations in Q2, buoyant stock market conditions and higher financial flows
to the commercial sector augur well for investment activity. Taking into consideration the above
factors and the impact of recent policy rate cuts, GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from
7.2 per cent in the April policy to 7.0 per cent – in the range of 6.4-6.7 per cent for H1:2019-20 and
7.2-7.5 per cent for H2 – with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).

23.
The MPC notes that growth impulses have weakened significantly as reflected in a further
widening of the output gap compared to the April 2019 policy. A sharp slowdown in investment
activity along with a continuing moderation in private consumption growth is a matter of concern. The
headline inflation trajectory remains below the target mandated to the MPC even after taking into
account the expected transmission of the past two policy rate cuts. Hence, there is scope for the MPC
to accommodate growth concerns by supporting efforts to boost aggregate demand, and in particular,
reinvigorate private investment activity, while remaining consistent with its flexible inflation targeting
mandate.
24.
Against this backdrop, all members of the MPC (Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr.
Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra, Dr. Viral V. Acharya and Shri Shaktikanta Das)
unanimously decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and change the stance of
monetary policy from neutral to accommodative.
25.

The minutes of the MPC’s meeting will be published by June 20, 2019.

26.

The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during August 5 to 7, 2019.
