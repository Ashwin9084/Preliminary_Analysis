Monetary Policy Statement, 2021-22
Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
October 6-8, 2021
On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic
situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (October 8,
2021) decided to:
•

keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)
unchanged at 4.0 per cent.

The reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the
marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent.
•

The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as
long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and
continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while
ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.

These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of
+/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.
The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.
Assessment
Global Economy
2.
Since the MPC’s meeting during August 4-6, 2021, the momentum of the
global recovery has ebbed across geographies with the rapid spread of the delta
variant of COVID-19, including in some countries with relatively high vaccination
rates. After sliding to a seven-month low in August, the global purchasing managers’
index (PMI) rose marginally in September. World merchandise trade volumes
remained resilient in Q2:2021, but more recently there has been a loss of momentum
with the persistence of supply and logistics bottlenecks.

2
3.
Commodity prices remain elevated, and consequently, inflationary pressures
have accentuated in most advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market
economies (EMEs), prompting monetary tightening by a few central banks in the
former group and several in the latter. Change in monetary policy stances, in
conjunction with a likely tapering of bond purchases in major advanced economies
later this year, is beginning to strain the international financial markets with a sharp
rise in bond yields in major AEs and EMEs after remaining range-bound in August.
The US dollar has strengthened sharply, while the EME currencies have weakened
since early-September with capital outflows in recent weeks.
Domestic Economy
4.
On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by
20.1 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) during Q1:2021-22 on a large favourable base;
however, its momentum was dragged down by the second wave of the pandemic.
The level of real GDP in Q1:2021-22 was 9.2 per cent below its pre-pandemic level
two years ago. On the demand side, almost all the constituents of GDP posted robust
y-o-y growth. On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) increased by
18.8 per cent y-o-y during Q1:2021-22.
5.
The rebound in economic activity gained traction in August-September,
facilitated by the ebbing of infections, easing of restrictions and a sharp pick-up in the
pace of vaccination. The south-west monsoon, after a lull in August, picked up in
September, narrowing the deficit in the cumulative seasonal rainfall to 0.7 per cent
below the long period average and kharif sowing exceeded the previous year’s level.
Record kharif foodgrains production of 150.5 million tonnes as per the first advance
estimates augurs well for the overall agricultural sector. By end-September, reservoir
levels at 80 per cent of the full reservoir level were above the decadal average, which
is expected to boost rabi production prospects.
6.
After a prolonged slowdown, industrial production posted a high y-o-y growth
for the fifth consecutive month in July. The manufacturing PMI at 53.7 in September
remained in positive territory. Services activity gained ground with support from the
pent-up demand for contact-intensive activities. The services PMI continued in
expansion zone in September at 55.2, although some sub-components
moderated. High-frequency indicators for August-September – railway freight traffic;
cement production; electricity demand; port cargo; e-way bills; GST and toll
collections – suggest progress in the normalisation of economic activity relative to
pre-pandemic levels; however, indicators such as domestic air traffic, two-wheeler
sales and steel consumption continue to lag. Non-oil export growth remained strong
on buoyant external demand.
7.
Headline CPI inflation at 5.3 per cent in August softened for the second
consecutive month, declining by one percentage point from the recent peak in MayJune 2021. This was primarily driven by an easing in food inflation. Fuel inflation
edged up to a new high in August. Core inflation, i.e. inflation excluding food and fuel,
remained elevated and sticky at 5.8 per cent in July-August 2021.

3
8.
System liquidity remained in large surplus in August-September, with daily
absorptions rising from an average of ₹7.7 lakh crore in July-August to ₹9.0 lakh
crore during September and ₹9.5 lakh crore during October (up to October 6) through
the fixed rate reverse repo, the 14-day variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) and finetuning operations under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF). Auctions of ₹1.2 lakh
crore under the secondary market government securities acquisition programme (GSAP 2.0) during Q2:2021-22 provided liquidity across the term structure. As on
October 1, 2021, reserve money (adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in
the cash reserve ratio) expanded by 8.3 per cent (y-o-y); money supply (M3) and
bank credit grew by 9.3 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively, as on September 24,
2021. India’s foreign exchange reserves increased by US$ 60.5 billion in 2021-22 (up
to October 1) to US$ 637.5 billion, partly reflecting the allocation of special drawing
rights (SDRs), and were close to 14 months of projected imports for 2021-22.
Outlook
9.
Going forward, the inflation trajectory is set to edge down during
Q3:2021-22, drawing comfort from the recent catch-up in kharif sowing and likely
record production. Along with adequate buffer stock of foodgrains, these factors
should help to keep cereal prices range bound. Vegetable prices, a major source of
inflation volatility, have remained contained in the year so far and are likely to remain
soft, assuming no disruption due to unseasonal rains. Supply side interventions by
the Government in the case of pulses and edible oils are helping to bridge the
demand supply gap; the situation is expected to improve with kharif harvest arrivals.
The resurgence of edible oils prices in the recent period, however, is a cause of
concern. On the other hand, pressures persist from crude oil prices which remain
volatile over uncertainties on the global supply and demand conditions. Domestic
pump prices remain at very high levels. Rising metals and energy prices, acute
shortage of key industrial components and high logistics costs are adding to input
cost pressures. Weak demand conditions, however, are tempering the pass-through
to output prices. The CPI headline momentum is moderating with the easing of food
prices which, combined with favourable base effects, could bring about a substantial
softening in inflation in the near-term. Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI
inflation is projected at 5.3 per cent for 2021-22; 5.1 per cent in Q2, 4.5 per cent in
Q3; 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced. CPI inflation for
Q1:2022-23 is projected at 5.2 per cent (Chart 1).
10.
Domestic economic activity is gaining traction with the ebbing of the second
wave. Going forward, rural demand is likely to maintain its buoyancy, given the above
normal kharif sowing while rabi prospects are bright. The substantial acceleration in
the pace of vaccination, the sustained lowering of new infections and the coming
festival season should support a rebound in the pent-up demand for contact intensive
services, strengthen the demand for non-contact intensive services, and bolster
urban demand. Monetary and financial conditions remain easy and supportive of
growth. Capacity utilisation is improving, while the business outlook and consumer
confidence are reviving. The broad-based reforms by the government focusing on
infrastructure development, asset monetisation, taxation, telecom sector and banking
sector should boost investor confidence, enhance capacity expansion and facilitate
crowding in of private investment. The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme
augurs well for domestic manufacturing and exports. Global semiconductor

4
shortages, elevated commodity prices and input costs, and potential global financial
market volatility are key downside risks to domestic growth prospects, along with
uncertainty around the future COVID-19 trajectory. Taking all these factors into
consideration, projection for real GDP growth is retained at 9.5 per cent in 2021-22
consisting of 7.9 per cent in Q2; 6.8 per cent in Q3; and 6.1 per cent in Q4 of
2021-22. Real GDP growth for Q1:2022-23 is projected at 17.2 per cent (Chart 2).

11.
Inflation prints in July-August were lower than anticipated. With core inflation
persisting at an elevated level, measures to further ameliorate supply side and cost
pressures, including through calibrated cuts in indirect taxes on petrol and diesel by
both Centre and States, would contribute to a more durable reduction in inflation and
anchoring of inflation expectations. The outlook for aggregate demand is
progressively improving but the slack is large: output is still below pre-COVID level
and the recovery is uneven and critically dependent upon policy support. Compared
to pre-pandemic levels, contact intensive services, which contribute around two-fifth
of economic activity in India, still lag considerably. Capacity utilisation in the
manufacturing sector is below its pre-pandemic levels and an early recovery to its
long-run average is critical for a sustained rebound in investment demand. Even as
the domestic economy is showing signs of mending, the external environment is
turning more uncertain and challenging, with headwinds from slowing growth in some
major Asian and advanced economies, steep jump in natural gas prices in the recent
weeks and concerns emanating from normalisation of monetary policy in some major
advanced economies. Against this backdrop, the ongoing domestic recovery needs
to be nurtured assiduously through all policy channels. The MPC will remain watchful
given the uncertainties surrounding the outlook for growth and inflation. Accordingly,
keeping in mind the evolving situation, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate
unchanged at 4 per cent and continue with an accommodative stance as long as
necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate
the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within
the target going forward.
