Monetary Policy Statement, 2020-21
Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
August 4 to 6, 2020
On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving
macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its
meeting today (August 6, 2020) decided to:
•
keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility
(LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent.
Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at
3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate
at 4.25 per cent.
•
The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative
stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the
impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation
remains within the target going forward.
These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the
medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent
within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.
The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement
below.
Assessment
Global Economy
2.

Since the MPC met in May 2020, global economic activity has remained

fragile and in retrenchment in several geographies. While the uneasy and
differently-paced withdrawal of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in some

2

countries enabled a sequential improvement in high frequency indicators
during May-July, a renewed surge in COVID-19 infections in major economies
and threats of a second wave of infections appear to have weakened these
early signs of revival. Contractions in economic activity have been more
severe in Q2:2020 than in Q1, and the near-term outlook points to a slow,
uneven and hesitant recovery pushed into the second half of the year, with
risks steeply slanted to the downside. Among advanced economies (AEs),
output in the US and the Euro area underwent a deeper contraction in
Q2:2020 than in the preceding quarter. Emerging market economies (EMEs)
are expected to shrink in Q2 as reflected in high frequency indicators.
3.

Global financial markets have rebounded since end-March 2020 with

intermittent pauses, shrugging off the volatility and sharp correction recorded
in Q1:2020. Portfolio flows returned to EMEs in Q2 after a massive reversal,
though there was moderation in July from the previous month’s level. EME
currencies have also appreciated in close co-movement, tracking weakening
of the US dollar. Crude oil prices have remained supported on supply cuts by
oil producing countries (OPEC plus) and improved demand prospects on the
gradual easing of lockdown restrictions since May. Gold prices have rallied to
an all-time high on August 5 on the back of safe haven demand. In AEs,
benign fuel prices and soft aggregate demand have kept inflation subdued. In
many EMEs, however, cost-push pressures arising from supply disruptions
and demand revival have shown up in consumer prices in June 2020. Global
food prices are elevated across the board.

Domestic Economy
4.

On the domestic front, economic activity had started to recover from the

lows of April-May following the uneven re-opening of some parts of the country
in June; however, surges of fresh infections have forced re-clamping of
lockdowns in several cities and states. Consequently, several high frequency
indicators have levelled off.

3

5.

The agricultural sector has emerged as a bright spot. Its prospects have

strengthened on the back of good spatial and temporal progress of the southwest monsoon. The cumulative monsoon rainfall was 1 per cent below the
long-period average (LPA) up to August 5, 2020. Spurred by the expanding
precipitation, the total area sown under kharif crops on July 31 was 5.9 per
cent higher than the normal area measured by the average over the period
2014-15 to 2018-19. As on July 30, 2020, the live storage in major reservoirs
was 41 per cent of the full reservoir level (FRL), which bodes well for the rabi
season. These developments have had a salutary effect on rural demand as
reflected in fertiliser production and sales of tractors, motorcycles and fastmoving consumer goods.
6.

The pace of contraction of industrial production, measured by the index

of industrial production (IIP), moderated to (-) 34.7 per cent in May from (-)
57.6 per cent a month ago, with the easing of lockdowns in different parts of
the country. All manufacturing sub-sectors, except pharmaceuticals, remained
in negative territory. The output of core industries in June contracted for the
fourth successive month though with a considerable moderation. The Reserve
Bank’s business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2020-21 hit its lowest mark in
the survey’s history. The manufacturing PMI remained in contraction, shrinking
further to 46.0 in July from 47.2 in the preceding month.
7.

High frequency indicators of services sector activity for May-June

indicate signs of a modest resumption of economic activity, especially in rural
areas, although at levels lower than a year ago. Notably, the decline in
passenger vehicle sales moderated to (-) 49.6 per cent in June from (-) 85.3
per cent in May, indicative of tentative urban demand, and faster recovery of
sales in rural areas. On the other hand, domestic air passenger traffic and
cargo traffic continued to post sharp contraction. Construction activity
remained tepid – cement production fell and finished steel consumption
moderated sharply in June. Imports of capital goods – a key indicator of
investment activity – declined further in June. The services PMI continued in
contractionary zone in July to 34.2, although the downturn eased relative to
the May and June readings.

8.

The National Statistical Office (NSO) released data on headline CPI for

the month of June 2020 on July 13, 2020, along with imputed back prints of
the index for April and May 2020. This resulted in a sharp upward revision of
food inflation for the month of April and May. During Q1:2020-21 food inflation
moderated from 10.5 per cent in April to 7.3 per cent in June 2020. Meanwhile,
fuel inflation edged up as international kerosene and LPG prices firmed up.
Inflation excluding food and fuel was at 5.4 per cent in June, reflecting a spike
in prices across most sub-groups. Inflation in transport and communication,
personal care and effects, pan-tobacco and education registered significant
increases in June. Headline CPI inflation, which was at 5.8 per cent in March
2020 was placed at 6.1 per cent in the provisional estimates for June 2020.
9.

For the second successive round, households’ three months ahead

expectations remained above their one year ahead expectations, indicating
their anticipation of lower inflation over the longer horizon. Producers’
sentiments on input prices remained muted as their salary outgoes fell. Their
selling prices contracted in Q1 in the April-June round of the Reserve Bank’s
industrial outlook survey. The contraction in output prices is also corroborated
by firms participating in the manufacturing PMI survey.
10.

Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially and systemic

liquidity remains in large surplus, due to the conventional and unconventional
measures by the Reserve Bank since February 2020. Cumulatively, these
measures assured liquidity of the order of ₹9.57 lakh crore or 4.7 per cent of
GDP. Reflecting these developments, reserve money (RM) increased by 15.4
per cent on a year-on-year basis (as on July 31, 2020), driven by a surge in
currency demand (23.1 per cent). Growth in money supply (M3), however, was
contained at 12.4 per cent as on July 17, 2020. Average daily net absorptions
under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) moderated from ₹5.3 lakh crore in
May 2020 to ₹4.1 lakh crore in June as government spending slowed. In July,
average daily net absorptions under the LAF moderated further to ₹4.0 lakh
crore, as government spending remained subdued. During 2020-21 (up to July
31), ₹1,24,154 crore was injected through open market operation (OMO)
purchases. In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the term structure

5

and improve transmission, the Reserve Bank conducted ‘operation twist’
auctions involving the simultaneous sale and purchase of government
securities for ₹10,000 crore on July 2, 2020. Furthermore, the utilisation of
refinance provided by the Reserve Bank to the National Bank for Agriculture
and Rural Development (NABARD), Small Industries Development Bank of
India (SIDBI) and the National Housing Bank (NHB) increased to ₹34,566
crore on July 31, 2020 from ₹22,334 crore during the May policy.
11.

The transmission to bank lending rates has improved further, with the

weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declining by 91
bps during March-June 2020. The spreads of 3-year AAA rated corporate
bonds over G-Secs of similar maturity declined from 276 bps on March 26,
2020 to 50 bps by end-July 2020. Even for the lowest investment grade bonds
(BBB-), spreads have come down by 125 bps by end-July 2020. Lower
borrowing costs have led to record primary issuance of corporate bonds of
₹2.1 lakh crore in the first quarter of 2020-21.
12.

India’s merchandise exports contracted for the fourth successive month

in June 2020, although the pace of fall moderated on improving shipments of
agriculture and pharmaceutical products. Imports fell sharply in June in a
broad-based manner, reflecting weak domestic demand and low international
crude oil prices. The merchandise trade balance recorded a surplus in June
(US$ 0.8 billion), after a gap of over 18 years. The current account balance
turned into a marginal surplus of 0.1 per cent of GDP in Q4 of 2019-20 as
against a deficit of 0.7 per cent a year ago. On the financing side, net foreign
direct investment moderated to US$ 4.4 billion in April-May 2020 from US$ 7.2
billion a year ago. In 2020-21 (till July 31), net foreign portfolio investment
(FPI) in equities at US$ 5.3 billion was higher than US$ 1.2 billion a year ago.
In the debt segment, however, there were outflows of US$ 4.4 billion during
the same period as against inflows of US$ 2.0 billion a year ago. Net
investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US$ 0.9 billion
during the same period. India’s foreign exchange reserves have increased by
US$ 56.8 billion in 2020-21 so far (up to July 31) to US$ 534.6 billion –
equivalent to 13.4 months of imports.

Outlook
13.

Supply chain disruptions on account of COVID-19 persist, with

implications for both food and non-food prices. A more favourable food
inflation outlook may emerge as the bumper rabi harvest eases prices of
cereals, especially if open market sales and public distribution offtake are
expanded on the back of significantly higher procurement. The relatively
moderate increases in minimum support prices (MSP) for the kharif crops and
monsoon are also supportive of benign inflation prospects. Nonetheless,
upside risks to food prices remain. The abatement of price pressure in key
vegetables is delayed and remains contingent upon normalisation of supplies.
Protein based food items could also emerge as a pressure point, given the
tight demand-supply balance in the case of pulses. The inflation outlook of
non-food categories is, however, fraught with uncertainty. Higher domestic
taxes on petroleum products have resulted in elevated domestic pump prices
and will impart broad-based cost-push pressures going forward. Volatility in
financial markets and rising asset prices also pose upside risks to the outlook.
Taking into consideration all these factors, headline inflation may remain
elevated in Q2:2020-21, but may moderate in H2:2020-21 aided by large
favourable base effects.
14.

Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in the rural economy is

expected to be robust, buoyed by the progress in kharif sowing. Manufacturing
firms responding to the Reserve Bank’s industrial outlook survey expect
domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2 and to sustain through
Q1:2021-22. On the other hand, consumer confidence turned more pessimistic
in July relative to the preceding round of the Reserve Bank’s survey. External
demand is expected to remain anaemic under the weight of the global
recession and contraction in global trade. Taking into consideration the above
factors, real GDP growth in Q2-Q4 is expected to evolve along the lines noted
in the May resolution. For the year 2020-21, as a whole, real GDP growth is
expected to be negative. An early containment of the COVID-19 pandemic
may impart an upside to the outlook. A more protracted spread of the

7

pandemic, deviations from the forecast of a normal monsoon and global
financial market volatility are the key downside risks.
15.

The June release of headline inflation after a gap of two months and

imputed prints of the CPI for April-May have added uncertainty to the inflation
outlook. The NSO has adopted best practices in producing these imputations
for the purpose of business continuity in the face of challenges to data
collection due to the nation-wide lockdown. The NSO has, however, not
provided inflation rates for April and May. For the purpose of monetary
formulation and conduct, therefore, the MPC is of the view that CPI prints for
April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series.
16.

The MPC noted that the economy is experiencing unprecedented stress

in an austere global environment. Extreme uncertainty characterises the
outlook, which is heavily contingent upon the intensity, spread and duration of
the pandemic – particularly the heightened risks associated with a second
wave of infections – and the discovery of the vaccine. In these conditions,
supporting the recovery of the economy assumes primacy in the conduct of
monetary policy. In pursuit of this objective, the stance of monetary policy
remains accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth and
mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. While space for further
monetary policy action in support of this stance is available, it is important to
use it judiciously and opportunistically to maximise the beneficial effects for
underlying economic activity.
17.

At the same time, the MPC is conscious that its primary mandate is to

achieve the medium-term target for CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of
+/- 2 per cent. It also recognises that the headline CPI prints of April-May,
2020 require more clarity. At the current juncture, the inflation objective itself is
further obscured by (a) the spike in food prices because of floods in eastern
India and ongoing lockdown related disruptions; and (b) cost-push pressures
in the form of high taxes on petroleum products, hikes in telecom charges,
rising raw material costs reflected in upward revisions in steel prices and rise
in gold prices on safe haven demand. Given the uncertainty surrounding the

8

inflation outlook and taking into consideration the extremely weak state of the
economy in the midst of an unprecedented shock from the ongoing pandemic,
it is prudent to pause and remain watchful of incoming data as to how the
outlook unravels.
18.

Meanwhile, the cumulative reduction of 250 basis points since February

2019 is working its way through the economy, lowering interest rates in
money, bond and credit markets, and narrowing down spreads. Financing
conditions have eased considerably, enabling financial flows via financial
markets, especially at a time when banks remain highly risk averse.
Accordingly, the MPC decides to stay on hold with regard to the policy rate
and remain watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available
space to support the revival of the economy.
19.

All members of the MPC – Dr. Chetan Ghate, Dr. Pami Dua, Dr.

Ravindra H. Dholakia, Dr. Mridul K. Saggar, Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and
Shri Shaktikanta Das – unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate
unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary
to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while
ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward.
20.

The minutes of the MPC’s meeting will be published by August 20,

2020.
