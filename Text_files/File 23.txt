Statement by Dr. Y. Venugopal Reddy,
Governor, Reserve Bank of India on the
Mid-term Review of Annual Policy
for the Year 2007-08
This Statement consists of two parts: Part I. Mid-term
Review of the Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for the
Year 2007-08; and Part II. Mid-term Review of the Annual
Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies for the
Year 2007-08. An analytical review of macroeconomic and
monetary developments was issued a day in advance as a
supplement to Part I of this Statement, providing information
and technical analysis with the help of charts and tables.

Part I. Mid-term Review of Annual Statement on
Monetary Policy for the Year 2007-08
2.
This part is divided into three sections: I. Assessment of
Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments during the First
Half of 2007-08; II. Stance of Monetary Policy for the Second
Half of 2007-08; and III. Monetary Measures.

Estimates released by the Central Statistical Organisation
(CSO) at the end of August 2007 placed real GDP growth during
April-June 2007 at 9.3 per cent as against 9.6 per cent in the
corresponding quarter last year. Real GDP growth originating in
agriculture, industry and services sectors was 3.8 per cent, 10.6
per cent and 10.6 per cent, respectively, in the first quarter of
1

2007-08 as against 2.8 per cent, 10.6 per cent and 11.6
per cent a year ago.
4.
The pace of the broadening expansion of economic activity
appears to have been sustained in the second quarter of
2007-08. Lead indicators point to congenial conditions for a
pick-up in agricultural activity on the back of the higher than
expected growth recorded in the preceding quarter. Rainfall during
the 2007 south-west monsoon season was five per cent above
the long-period average (LPA) for the country as a whole
according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Of the
36 meteorological subdivisions across the country, rainfall was
excess/normal in as many as 30 sub-divisions as against 26 in
the 2006 season. On the other hand, six sub-divisions which
have received deficient rainfall in the 2007 season include Punjab,
Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, western Uttar Pradesh and eastern
Madhya Pradesh which are major foodgrains producing regions.
As on October 18, 2007 live storage in 81 major reservoirs was
81 per cent of designated capacity which is 19.3 per cent higher
than the last 10 years’ average but 3.1 per cent lower than the
level a year ago. The water storage level supports the prospects
for rabi production.
5.
Benefiting from favourable south-west monsoon conditions,
the area sown under kharif rice, pulses and oilseeds increased
to 37.3 million hectares, 12.5 million hectares and 17.8 million
hectares, respectively, up to October 19, 2007 as against 37.1
million hectares, 11.4 million hectares and 16.8 million hectares
in the 2006 season. Acreage under cash crops such as cotton,
jute and sugarcane was also higher than a year ago. First
advance estimates released by the Ministry of Agriculture place
kharif foodgrains production at 112.2 million tonnes, below the
2

target of 114.2 million tonnes, but higher than 110.5 million
tonnes recorded last year. As per these initial estimates,
production of nine major oilseeds during the kharif season
is placed at 16.1 million tonnes which is lower than the target
of 18.5 million tonnes, but significantly higher than the output
of 13.9 million tonnes in 2006-07. Production of cotton, jute
and sugarcane is also expected to register an increase in
2007-08.
6.
The index of industrial production (IIP) rose by 9.8
per cent during April-August 2007 as against 11.0 per cent in
the corresponding period last year. Manufacturing output
increased by 10.3 per cent (12.2 per cent a year ago) while
mining activity and electricity generation rose by 5.4 per cent
(3.0 per cent) and 8.3 per cent (5.7 per cent), respectively.
Manufacturing activity was led by food products, wood products,
chemicals, basic metals and alloys and non-transport machinery
and equipments which together constituted 53.9 per cent of the
manufacturing sector and contributed 71.5 per cent of its growth
during April-August 2007. On the other hand, deceleration in the
production of textiles and transport equipment, and decline in
the production of metal products and parts which have a
combined share of 22.3 per cent in the manufacturing sector,
had a moderating effect on manufacturing activity as well as on
overall industrial growth during this period. The use-based
classification indicates sustained investment demand as reflected
in an increase of 21.3 per cent (19.5 per cent) in capital goods
production. Production of basic goods and intermediate goods
increased by 10.0 per cent (8.3 per cent) and 9.3 per cent
(10.4 per cent), respectively. Consumer goods growth decelerated
to 6.2 per cent (11.4 per cent), mainly due to a decline of
2.3 per cent in the consumer durables. The six infrastructure
3

industries, which together comprise nearly 27 per cent of the
IIP, posted a growth of 6.6 per cent during April-August 2007
as against 8.3 per cent a year ago. Except for electricity
generation, all other sectors of core infrastructure recorded
decelerated growth.
7.
Information on corporate activity indicates that sales of
selected companies had risen by 19.2 per cent during
April-June 2007, lower than 25.6 per cent in the corresponding
quarter a year ago. The rise in other income, lower interest
burden, improvements in operational efficiency, higher capacity
utilisation and economies of scale appear to have contributed
substantially to overall financial performance and high profit
margins especially for larger companies, despite an increase of
18.1 per cent in depreciation provision. Net profits rose by 33.9
per cent in the first quarter of 2007-08 as against 34.7 per cent
during the corresponding period last year. Buoyant equity markets
enabled higher mobilisation of resources by the private corporate
sector through public issues and private placements than in the
corresponding period of 2006-07. Early results for the second
quarter of 2007-08 (July-September) for a truncated sample of
companies indicate continuing moderation in sales and profitability
growth relative to the corresponding quarter a year ago as well
as the preceding quarter, especially for manufacturing companies.
On the other hand, some decline in the interest burden on a
year-on-year basis, reflecting the relatively higher recourse of
corporates to external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and
consequently lower interest payments relative to domestic
borrowings as well as gains thereon in rupee terms due to
exchange rate appreciation boosted other income and helped to
shore up net profit margins.

8.
The Reserve Bank’s Industrial Outlook Survey conducted
mainly during August 2007, which covers private manufacturing
companies, indicates stable business conditions. Half of the
respondent companies reported increase in production and a
better overall business situation; over 40 per cent indicated no
change in these characteristics. A majority of respondents felt
that capacity utilisation would remain unchanged. The overall
assessment of working capital requirement, availability of finance
and overall financial situation was positive for July-September
2007. The assessment of moderation in export and import growth
that started in the beginning of the year continued to prevail. On
a net basis, respondents reported a higher increase in input
cost than in selling prices. The business expectation index for
July-September 2007 improved by 3.1 percentage points from
its level in the previous quarter; however, it was lower by
1.8 percentage points from its level a year ago. For OctoberDecember 2007, the business expectation index rose by
3.3 percentage points from its level in the previous quarter though
lower by 0.9 percentage points on a year-on-year basis. Over a
fifth of respondents expect increase in employment level in their
companies during July-December 2007. While 60 per cent did
not expect any change in profit margins, a fourth of the
respondents expected increase in profitability.
9.
Other business confidence surveys which also cover
services sector companies present a somewhat mixed picture.
According to one survey, business confidence shows a fall of
8.9 percentage points in July-December 2007 relative to its level
in the previous round, reflecting some increase in the cost of
finance and rising prices of raw materials. A lower level of
confidence in overall economic conditions and industry/firm level
performance is also reflected in some other surveys. On the
5

other hand, some surveys report optimism on value of production,
new orders and utilisation of capacity for the second half of
2007-08. In this view, seasonally adjusted purchasing managers’
indices, which cover only manufacturing companies, point to a
robust improvement in operating conditions with marked increase
in output and new orders, underpinned by favourable domestic
market conditions. Price increases for both inputs and outputs
were stated to be high by respondents but were not expected to
impede the step-up in purchasing activity and hiring of additional
staff due to higher production requirements.
10.
Lead indicators suggest that the pace of expansion in the
services sector activity has been sustained during April-August
2007. The communication sector has recorded robust growth
with 34 million telephone connections (fixed plus cellular) in
April-August 2007 which is 55.4 per cent higher than 22 million
connections provided in the corresponding period last year.
Cargo handled at major ports increased by 14.2 per cent,
whereas handling of import cargo and export cargo in the civil
aviation sector increased by 23.5 per cent and 5.4 per cent,
respectively. Railway revenue earnings from freight traffic
increased by 7.0 per cent which was lower than the growth of
9.9 per cent in the corresponding period last year, mainly due to
lower traffic for carriage of foodgrains and raw materials for
steel plants. Passengers handled at domestic and international
terminals increased by 27.8 per cent and 12.4 per cent,
respectively, as against 40.1 per cent and 12.9 per cent a
year ago.
11.
According to the CSO’s end-August 2007 release, there
are indications of underlying shifts in the constituents of
aggregate demand. As a proportion to GDP, real private final
6

consumption expenditure declined to 58.8 per cent during the
first quarter of 2007-08 from 60.8 per cent a year ago. On the
other hand, real gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) increased
to 29.6 per cent of GDP from 27.9 per cent, indicative of the
investment led acceleration of growth in the Indian economy.
As regards external demand, net exports are placed at
(-)1.0 per cent of GDP in April-June 2007 vis-à-vis 0.8 per cent
a year ago.
12.
On a year-on-year basis, total credit extended by
scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) increased by Rs.3,81,333
crore (23.3 per cent) up to October 12, 2007 as compared with
an increase of Rs.3,66,463 crore (28.8 per cent) a year ago. On
a financial year basis, credit extended by SCBs increased by
Rs.90,262 crore (4.7 per cent) up to October 12, 2007 as
compared with the increase of Rs.1,30,764 crore (8.7 per cent)
in the corresponding period last year. Food credit declined by
Rs.9,501 crore as against a decline of Rs.7,246 crore in the
previous year. Non-food credit registered an increase of
Rs.99,763 crore (5.3 per cent) as compared with an increase of
Rs.1,38,010 crore (9.4 per cent) in the corresponding period of
the previous year.
13.
Provisional information available from select SCBs up to
August 2007 indicates that credit to industries expanded by
24.6 per cent up to August on a year-on-year basis, slowing
from 25.7 per cent in March 2007. Credit to agriculture expanded
by 24.4 per cent (32.4 per cent in March 2007). On the other
hand, bank credit to services and personal loans at
24.5 per cent (31.0 per cent) and 19.8 per cent (26.5 per cent),
respectively, recorded a sizeable slowdown. Within the industrial
sector, credit off-take by infrastructure, chemicals and vehicles
7

and auto parts picked up to 32.1 per cent (26.8 per cent),
16.1 per cent (14.2 per cent) and 28.5 per cent (11.0 per cent),
respectively. On the other hand, credit disbursed decelerated in
the case of textiles to 28.0 per cent (34.2 per cent), metals to
19.6 per cent (26.7 per cent), engineering to 24.0 per cent
(24.5 per cent) and petroleum to 35.7 per cent (41.0 per cent).
In the services sector, all constituents barring computer software,
tourism and hotels and non-banking financial companies recorded
deceleration in credit off-take. In particular, growth in credit to
real estate decelerated to 52.9 per cent from 69.8 per cent in
March 2007, but still remained high. Under personal loans,
sizeable deceleration in credit occurred under housing
(to 16.6 per cent in August 2007 from 24.6 per cent in March
2007), consumer durables (to 4.1 per cent from 28.9 per cent)
and other personal loans (to 22.5 per cent from 30.3 per cent).
Credit to industry recorded the highest share of 41.1 per cent in
total incremental non-food bank credit by August 2007, followed
by services (23.8 per cent), personal loans (22.4 per cent) and
agriculture (12.7 per cent). The shares of infrastructure,
engineering and chemical industries in incremental credit
to industry increased from 21.4 per cent, 6.0 per cent and
4.9 per cent, respectively, in March 2007 to 26.7 per cent, 6.2
per cent and 5.5 per cent in August 2007. The share of metals,
textiles, petroleum and food processing declined from 12.4
per cent, 14.1 per cent, 7.3 per cent and 6.1 per cent,
respectively, to 10.0 per cent, 12.4 per cent, 6.2 per cent and
6.0 per cent. The share of the priority sector in incremental
non-food gross bank credit declined marginally to 31.0 per cent
from 31.2 per cent. Priority sector advances rose by 20.2 per
cent up to August 2007, lower than 24.0 per cent in March
2007. While the share of agriculture declined to 12.7 per cent in

14.
On a year-on-year basis, commercial banks’ investments
in shares, bonds/debentures and commercial paper (CP) declined
by Rs.5,514 crore (6.7 per cent) up to October 12, 2007 as
compared with a decline of Rs.895 crore (1.1 per cent) a year
ago. On a financial year basis, such investments by banks fell
by Rs.6,930 crore (8.5 per cent) during 2007-08 so far (up to
October 12), as against an increase of Rs.2,514 crore
(3.2 per cent) in the corresponding period of 2006-07. Banks’
investments in instruments issued by all-India financial institutions
and mutual funds, however, increased by Rs.49,847 crore as
against an increase of Rs.11,526 crore in the corresponding
period of the previous year. The year-on-year growth in total
resource flow from SCBs to the commercial sector was 22.1
per cent, over and above the growth of 28.0 per cent a year
ago. In addition, during the first quarter of the current financial
year, corporates raised additional resources in the form of external
commercial borrowings (ECBs) amounting to Rs.29,498 crore
as against Rs.18,882 crore in the first quarter last year.
15.
On an annual basis, the growth in aggregate deposits at
24.9 per cent (Rs.5,69,061 crore) was higher than that of 20.4
per cent (Rs.3,88,528 crore) a year ago. On a financial year
basis, aggregate deposits of SCBs increased by 9.6 per cent
(Rs.2,49,724 crore) up to October 12, 2007 as compared with
an increase of 8.5 per cent (Rs.1,79,923 crore) in the
corresponding period of the previous year. Reflecting high
9

profitability and internal generation of resources by the corporate
sector, its share in total deposits with the banking system has
been increasing, mainly in the form of short-term deposits.
On the other hand, the share of savings deposits in total deposits
has been declining. The incremental annual non-food
credit-deposit ratio declined to 66.4 per cent on October 12,
2007 from 95.3 per cent a year ago.
16.
In view of the lower credit growth, banks undertook
incremental investment in statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) securities.
SCBs’ investment in SLR securities at Rs.1,52,488 crore during
the current financial year up to October 12, 2007 was higher than
that of Rs.49,717 crore in the corresponding period of the previous
year. The ratio of such investments to aggregate deposits on an
incremental basis was 30.9 per cent as against 6.1 per cent in the
corresponding period last year. It needs to be mentioned that a
part of this increase was due to bank recapitalisation bonds
(amounting to Rs.5,270 crore) being considered as approved
securities for SLR, and part due to subscription to SLR bonds
issued under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS). Even after
adjusting for banks’ repo/reverse repo with the Reserve Bank
under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), SLR investments at
Rs.86,758 crore during 2007-08 so far were much higher than the
increase of Rs.38,727 crore in the corresponding period last year.
Consequently, on an outstanding basis, commercial banks’
holdings of Government and other approved securities increased
to 30.0 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as
on October 12, 2007 from 28.0 per cent at end-March 2007.
While these investments exceeded the required SLR by
Rs.1,56,851 crore (Rs.84,223 crore at end-March 2007), the
excess SLR investment adjusted for LAF holdings amounted to
Rs.1,20,306 crore or 3.8 per cent of NDTL.
10

17.
Year-on-year money supply (M3) at 21.8 per cent as on
October 12, 2007 was higher than 18.9 per cent a year ago and
above the range of 17.0-17.5 per cent indicated in the Annual
Policy Statement of April 2007. On a financial year basis,
M3 increased by 8.2 per cent (Rs.2,72,010 crore) up to October
12, 2007 as compared with the increase of 7.7 per cent
(Rs.2,11,279 crore) in the corresponding period of the
previous year.
18.
Reserve money increased by 24.4 per cent on a year-onyear as on October 19, 2007 as compared with 20.2 per cent a
year ago. On a financial year basis, reserve money increased
by 8.0 per cent (Rs.57,060 crore) up to October 19, 2007 as
compared with the increase of 7.5 per cent (Rs.42,932 crore) in
the corresponding period of the previous year. The large increase
in reserve money in the current financial year so far reflects in
part the initial impact of recent increases in the cash reserve
ratio (CRR). Among the components of reserve money, therefore,
bankers’ deposits with the Reserve Bank increased by 18.7
per cent (Rs.36,984 crore) during the current year so far as
compared with an increase of 5.2 per cent (Rs.7,047 crore) in
the corresponding period last year. Currency in circulation,
however, registered a lower growth of 4.5 per cent (Rs.22,589
crore) as compared with 8.7 per cent (Rs.37,319 crore). Among
the sources of reserve money, Reserve Bank’s net credit to the
Central Government declined by Rs.1,43,116 crore as compared
with an increase of Rs.15,029 crore in the corresponding period
last year. Adjusted for transactions under the LAF, Reserve
Bank’s credit to the Central Government showed a decline of
Rs.81,981 crore mainly on account of increased MSS issuance
in 2007-08 so far. The Reserve Bank’s net foreign exchange
assets (NFEA) increased by Rs.1,71,080 crore as against an
11

increase of Rs.77,310 crore during the corresponding period of
the previous year. Adjusted for revaluation, NFEA increased by
Rs.2,17,201 crore as compared with an increase of Rs.42,544
crore during the corresponding period of the previous year. The
ratio of NFEA to currency increased from 171.8 per cent on
March 31, 2007 to 196.9 per cent by October 19, 2007.
19.
Movements in the key monetary and banking aggregates
in the second quarter of 2007-08 were reflected in generally
easy conditions of liquidity, except for some short-lived episodes
of tightness. The banking system experienced conditions of
surplus liquidity on account of substantial deposit mobilisation
relative to credit demand as well as capital augmentation through
several large IPOs. Consequently, banks made sizeable
investments in Government securities/Treasury bills issued under
the MSS. With effect from August 6, 2007 the daily ceiling of
Rs.3,000 crore on reverse repo under the LAF stipulated since
March 5, 2007 was removed. During August 6-31, 2007 average
daily net absorption under the LAF was Rs.25,333 crore, despite
an additional amount of Rs.13,500 crore absorbed under the
MSS. On August 9, 2007 the Reserve Bank transferred its annual
profit to the Central Government which included a one-time
payment of Rs.34,309 crore on account of profit on sale of the
Reserve Bank’s stake in the State Bank of India (SBI) which
augmented the Central Government’s cash balances with the
Reserve Bank. Large absorption of liquidity under the LAF and
the MSS continued till the third week of September when quarterly
advance tax outflows and build-up of the Centre’s cash balances
led to a sharp drop in the daily volumes of funds offered at the
LAF auctions, and the Reserve Bank had to inject liquidity under
the LAF on September 21 and 28. In view of large capital inflows,
an additional amount of Rs.68,685 crore was sterilised during
12

September and October under the MSS with the outstanding
sterilisation under the MSS increasing to Rs.1,77,155 crore by
October 26, 2007. The overhang of liquidity as reflected in the
sum of LAF, MSS and the Central Governments’ cash balances
increased from Rs.85,770 crore at end-March 2007 to
Rs.1,24,632 crore on August 6, 2007 and further to Rs.2,22,582
crore by October 24, 2007. The Government of India, in
consultation with the Reserve Bank, revised the ceiling under
MSS for the year 2007-08 from Rs.1,10,000 crore to Rs.1,50,000
crore on August 8, 2007 and further to Rs.2,00,000 crore on
October 4, 2007.
20.
Inflation, measured by variations in the wholesale price
index (WPI) on a year-on-year basis, eased from its peak of 6.4
per cent on April 07, 2007 to 3.1 per cent by October 13, 2007.
On an average basis, however, annual WPI inflation at 5.2
per cent was higher than 4.6 per cent a year ago.
21.
At a disaggregated level, prices of primary articles (weight:
22.0 per cent in the WPI basket) and manufactured products
(weight: 63.8 per cent) increased by 5.2 per cent and 4.1
per cent, respectively, by October 13, 2007 as compared with an
increase of 8.1 per cent and 4.6 per cent a year ago. An analysis
of constituent price movements indicates that the rise in prices of
edible oils, oilseeds and oilcakes, which together have a weight
of 6.9 per cent in the WPI, contributed nearly 40 per cent of the
headline inflation, while 16 per cent of headline inflation came
from increases in prices of primary food items especially rice, milk
and vegetables. Excluding food, headline WPI inflation was 3.0
per cent as against 5.0 per cent a year ago. Other items that
contributed to headline inflation included cement, drugs and
medicines, iron and steel and electrical machinery.
13

22.
Annual inflation of the ‘fuel, power, light and lubricants’
group (weight: 14.2 per cent) declined to 1.6 per cent as on
October 13, 2007 as against 5.0 per cent a year ago. Excluding
the fuel group, inflation was at 4.4 per cent (5.6 per cent a year
ago). The average price of the Indian basket of international
crude was at around US $ 72.1 per barrel during July-September
2007 higher than US $ 66.4 in April-June 2007 and US $ 56.6 in
January-March 2007. Since the last revision of domestic retail
prices of petrol and diesel in February 2007, the price of the
Indian basket had increased by about 32 per cent in US dollar
terms and about 21 per cent in rupee terms up to September
2007. Subsequently, there has been a further increase in crude
oil prices in the international markets and the average price of
the Indian crude basket has gone up to US $ 80 per barrel as
on October 23, 2007. While the price of the Indian crude basket
in rupee terms went up by an average of 22.4 per cent per
annum between 2002-03 and 2006-07, the increase in prices of
petrol and diesel and the freely priced products (such as aviation
turbine fuel, furnace oil and naphtha) were 12.8 per cent and
16.5 per cent per annum, respectively. This suggests an average
pass-through of around 57 per cent in the case of petrol and
diesel and around 73 per cent in the case of the freely priced
products. The subsidy schemes for kerosene and domestic LPG,
which were available through public distribution system (PDS)
until March 2007, have been extended till March 2010. Domestic
retail prices of petrol and diesel have remained unchanged after
two downward revisions in 2006-07, thereby increasing the
magnitude of incomplete pass-through. The issue of oil bonds
and burden sharing by upstream oil public sector units (PSUs)
in the form of discounts on crude oil and products is expected to
mitigate a part of the under-recoveries. Overall, inflation risks on
14

account of oil prices remain incipient and it is possible that
some increase in domestic prices of petroleum products would
translate into some elevation in WPI inflation.
23.
Inflation, based on the consumer price index (CPI) for
industrial workers, showed a sharp increase to 7.3 per cent on a
year-on-year basis in August 2007 from 6.3 per cent a year ago.
Year-on-year inflation based on the CPI for urban non-manual
employees, agricultural labourers and rural labourers in
September 2007 increased to 5.7 per cent, 7.9 per cent and 7.6
per cent, respectively, from 6.6 per cent, 7.3 per cent and 7.0
per cent a year ago. A major portion of the differences between
inflation rates based on the WPI and CPIs is explained by prices
of food items which have a higher weight in the CPIs than in the
WPI. Year-on-year CPI inflation for industrial workers was 9.6
per cent for food items and 5.2 per cent for non-food items in
August 2007 whereas for urban non-manual employees and
agricultural labourers, it was 7.7 per cent and 8.8 per cent for
food items, respectively, and 4.0 per cent and 6.0 per cent for
non-food items, in September 2007.
24.
In drawing meaningful inferences from the data on fiscal
developments during the year, it is necessary to take account of
the one-time transaction relating to transfer of the Reserve Bank’s
shareholding in the State Bank of India (SBI). On June 29, 2007
the Central Government paid Rs.35,531 crore to the Reserve
Bank as consideration amount for the transfer. On August 9,
2007 the Reserve Bank transferred an amount of
Rs.45,720 crore as its surplus for 2006-07 (July-June) to the
Government which included an amount of Rs.34,309 crore on
account of sale of SBI shareholding to the Government. Excluding
the transactions relating to transfer of the Reserve Bank’s stake
15

in the SBI to the Government, revenue receipts of the Central
Government amounted to 26.7 per cent of the budget estimates
(BE) in April-August 2007 as compared with 26.4 per cent in
April-August 2006. Tax revenue and non-tax revenue were 24.6
per cent and 36.8 per cent of the BE, respectively, during AprilAugust 2007 as compared with 24.9 per cent and 32.9 per cent
a year ago. Total expenditure at 36.8 per cent of the BE in
April-August 2007 was higher than 35.5 per cent a year ago. As
a proportion to the BE, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) and revenue
deficit increased to 67.6 per cent and 122.9 per cent, respectively,
during April-August 2007 as compared with 61.0 per cent and
93.7 per cent in the corresponding period last year. A notable
feature of deficit financing this year so far has been the decline
in net mobilisation from small savings deposits and certificates
for the first time.
25.
The gross market borrowings of the Central Government
through dated securities at Rs.1,27,060 crore (Rs.1,17,548
crore a year ago) during 2007-08 so far (up to October 26,
2007) constituted 67.3 per cent of the BE. Net market borrowings
at Rs.75,387 crore (Rs.65,951 crore a year ago) constituted
68.7 per cent of the BE. An additional amount of Rs.27,500
crore (net) was mobilised through issuance of Treasury Bills
(TBs) over and above the rollover of TBs maturing during the
period. The weighted average yield and weighted average
maturity of Central Government securities issued during
2007-08 so far (up to October 26, 2007) were higher at 8.20
per cent and 14.41 years, respectively, as compared with 7.91
per cent and 14.08 years for those issued during the
corresponding period last year. As against the provisional net
allocation of Rs.28,206 crore (gross Rs.45,385 crore) for their
market borrowing programme, the State Governments have
16

raised a net amount of Rs.8,808 crore up to October 26, 2007.
As in the past, an indicative issuance calendar for issue of
dated securities for the second half of 2007-08 was issued on
September 24, 2007 in consultation with the Central Government
with a view to enabling institutional and retail investors to plan
their investment in a better manner and also for providing
transparency and stability in the Government securities market.
In addition to the market borrowing programme, recapitalisation
bonds amounting to Rs.12,001 crore were issued in August and
September, 2007. Moreover, special securities amounting to
Rs.7,500 crore with features similar to securities issued to oil
companies and the Food Corporation of India in 2006-07, would
be issued during the remaining part of 2007-08. Furthermore, it
was announced on October 11, 2007 that the Central
Government would bear 42.7 per cent (Rs.23,457 crore) of the
total under-recoveries of the oil companies (estimated at
Rs.54,935 crore for 2007-08) in the form of oil bonds. Thus,
securities amounting to Rs.42,958 crore are planned to be issued
by the Central Government (excluding MSS) in addition to the
regular market borrowing programme for 2007-08 as against
Rs.40,321 crore issued in 2006-07.
26.
During the second quarter of 2007-08, financial markets
remained generally stable with conditions of abundant liquidity.
Reflecting this environment, interest rates moderated in almost
all segments of the financial system. Overnight interest rates,
which averaged 0.26 per cent in July, returned to the LAF corridor
after the ceiling on reverse repo acceptance under the LAF was
removed from August 6, 2007 and the CRR was increased from
6.5 per cent to 7.0 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning
August 4, 2007. Despite the overall stability, transient spikes in
overnight rates were witnessed in August. Call money rates
17

averaged 6.31 per cent in August 2007. Some hardening of overnight
rates was also witnessed in the second half of September on
account of reduction in liquidity with the banking system due to
sizeable tax outflows and build-up of the Centre’s cash balances
which was also reflected in reduced LAF reverse repo. The call
money rate has declined from 14.07 per cent in March 2007 to
6.31 per cent in August and to 6.01 per cent on October 26, 2007.
Overnight rates in other segments, viz., market repo and
collateralised borrowing and lending obligations (CBLO) have moved
in tandem with call money rates. Market repo (other than LAF) and
CBLO rates declined from 8.13 and 7.73 per cent, respectively, in
March 2007 to 5.66 and 6.00 per cent as on October 26, 2007.
The daily average volume (one leg) in the call money market rose
from Rs.11,608 crore in March 2007 to Rs.12,981 crore as on
October 26, 2007. The corresponding volumes in the market repo
were Rs.8,687 crore and Rs.27,075 crore, respectively. In the CBLO
segment, the volumes were Rs.17,662 crore and Rs.25,090 crore,
respectively. As on October 26, 2007 interest rates for CBLO,
market repo and call money stood at 5.66 per cent, 6.00 per cent
and 6.01 per cent, respectively.
27.
The primary yield on 91-day Treasury Bills declined to
7.02 per cent on October 24, 2007 from 7.98 per cent on
end-March 2007 whereas the yield on 364-day Treasury Bills
declined to 7.36 per cent from 7.98 per cent over the same
period. There was higher mobilisation from CPs as the
outstanding amount of CP was Rs.33,614 crore by endSeptember 2007 as compared with Rs.17,688 crore at
end-March 2007, with the weighted average discount rate on
CP declining to 8.95 per cent from 11.33 per cent over this
period. In the market for certificates of deposit (CDs) also, the
weighted average discount rate declined from 10.75 per cent at
18

the end of March 2007 to 8.57 per cent by end-September,
accompanied by an increase of 27.0 per cent in the outstanding
amount (from Rs.93,272 crore to Rs.1,18,481 crore). It may be
noted that overnight and short-term money market rates had
firmed up at the end of March 2007 reflecting liquidity tightening
resulting from end-year tax outflows.
28.
In the foreign exchange market, large surplus conditions
in the spot market resulted in a sharp increase in average daily
turnover to US $ 52.9 billion in mid-September 2007 from a
level of US $ 27.5 billion a year ago. While the inter-bank turnover
increased from US $ 20 billion to US $ 37.6 billion, the merchant
turnover increased from US $ 7 billion to US $ 15.2 billion.
According to the triennial central bank survey conducted by the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS), India is among the
fastest growing foreign exchange markets in terms of turnover.
There has been a general softening in forward premia across all
maturities. The six-month forward premia eased from 3.60 per
cent in March 2007 to 2.53 per cent by end-June 2007 and
further to 1.20 per cent as on October 26, 2007.
29.
The yield on Government securities with one-year residual
maturity declined from 7.55 per cent at end-March 2007 to 7.40
per cent as on October 26, 2007. The yield on Government
securities with 10-year residual maturity also declined from 7.97
per cent to 7.88 per cent. The yield on Government securities
with 20-year residual maturity rose from 8.23 per cent to 8.28
per cent. The yield spread between 10-year and one-year
Government securities widened from 42 basis points to 48 basis
points. The yield spread between 20-year and one-year
Government securities also widened from 68 basis points to 88
basis points during the same period.
19

30.
During April–October 2007, public sector banks (PSBs)
decreased their deposit rates, particularly at the upper end of
the range for various maturities, by 25-60 basis points. Deposit
rates of PSBs increased by 25-75 basis points at the lower end
for deposits of maturities of one year and above. Interest rates
offered by the PSBs on deposits of above one year maturity
moved from 7.25-9.75 per cent in April 2007 to 8.0-9.5 per cent
in October 2007. Private sector banks’ deposit rates for up to
one year maturity decreased from a range of 3.00-10.00
per cent to 2.5-9.25 per cent over the same period. Foreign
banks’ deposit rates for up to one year maturity also declined
from a range of 3.00-9.50 per cent to 2.00-9.00 per cent during
the same period. The benchmark prime lending rates (BPLRs)
of private sector banks moved from a range of 12.50-17.25
per cent to 13.00-16.50 per cent in the same period. The range
of BPLRs for PSBs and foreign banks, however, remained
unchanged at 12.50-13.50 per cent and 10.00-15.50 per cent,
respectively, during this period.
31.
During the second quarter of 2007-08, equity market
activity recorded a pick-up in terms of issuances in the domestic
primary segment as well as in international stock exchanges.
The BSE Sensex (1978-79=100) increased from 13,072 at
end-March 2007 to cross the 15,000 level on July 9, 2007, the
16,000 level on September 19, 2007, the 17,000 level on
September 27, 2007, the 18,000 level on October 9, 2007, the
19,000 level on October 15, 2007 and closed at 19,243 on
October 26, 2007. According to the Securities and Exchange
Board of India (SEBI), net investments by foreign institutional
investors (FIIs) in the equity market were significantly higher at
Rs.62,139 crore (US $ 15.1 billion) during April-October 19, 2007
as compared with net investments of Rs.10,231 crore (US $ 2.2
20

billion) in the corresponding period last year. Mutual funds
mobilised funds of the order of Rs.1,05,614 crore during
April-September 2007 as against Rs.60,048 crore a year ago.
Developments in the External Sector
32.
Balance of payments data for the first quarter of 2007-08
released by the Reserve Bank at the end of September 2007
indicate a widening of the merchandise trade deficit on a
year-on-year basis, sustained buoyancy in invisibles and sizeable
net capital inflows which comfortably met the external financing
requirement for April-June 2007 and also enabled a build-up of
international reserves, fortifying the stability and strength of India’s
external sector. In US dollar terms, merchandise export growth
was 17.8 per cent during April-June 2007 as against 23.7
per cent in the first quarter of the previous year. Commoditywise data available from the Directorate General of Commercial
Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S) for April-May 2007 indicate
that exports of petroleum products, engineering goods and gems
and jewellery together contributed 69 per cent of overall export
growth as compared with 66 per cent in April-May 2006.
The growth of exports of primary products moderated to 7.1
per cent, mainly due to the deceleration in the exports of
agriculture and allied products; exports of ores and minerals,
however, showed a turnaround during April-May 2007. Exports
of manufactures registered a growth of 12.7 per cent in AprilMay 2007 as against 12.2 per cent a year ago. While growth of
exports of chemicals and related products moderated to 7.9
per cent as compared with 12.1 per cent, export of textiles and
related products declined by 7.7 per cent as against an increase
of 11.6 per cent. Merchandise import payments rose by 21.3
per cent during the first quarter of the 2007-08 as compared
21

with 22.9 per cent a year ago. While crude oil import growth at
8.0 per cent moderated from 45.2 per cent, non-oil import
payments increased by 47.4 per cent, reflecting the underlying
strength of domestic demand. The main drivers of non-oil import
growth in 2007-08 so far (April-May) were capital goods, iron
and steel, gold and silver, pearls, precious and semi-precious
stones, chemicals and metalliferrous ores and metal scrap. China
remained the major source of imports in April-May 2007
accounting for 10 per cent of total imports and 14.8 per cent of
non-oil imports. On a payments basis, the merchandise trade
deficit widened to US $ 21.6 billion in the first quarter of 2007-08
from US $ 16.9 billion a year ago.
33.
During the first quarter of 2007-08, gross invisible receipts
comprising services, current transfers and income at US $ 31.4
billion amounted to nearly 90 per cent of merchandise exports,
recording a year-on-year increase of 27.5 per cent. Software
exports, travel earnings, other professional and business services
and remittances from overseas Indians underpinned the strength
of invisible receipts. On the other hand, invisible payments
increased by 18.6 per cent, mainly on account of a surge in
payments related to travel, business and management
consultancy, engineering and technical services and dividend
and profit payouts. On a net basis, the invisible account recorded
a surplus of US $ 16.9 billion during the first quarter of 2007-08
as against US $ 12.4 billion in the corresponding quarter of the
previous year. The current account deficit (CAD) amounted
to US $ 4.7 billion, broadly the same as in the first quarter
of 2006-07.
34.
Net capital flows surged to US $ 15.3 billion during the
first quarter of 2007-08 from US $ 10.6 billion a year ago. Net
22

external commercial borrowings (ECB) inflows at US $ 7.0 billion
were sizeable and accounted for 45.8 per cent of total net capital
flows as compared with nearly US $ 4.0 billion or 37.5 per cent
of net capital flows in the first quarter of the previous year. The
growing appetite of Indian companies for global expansion was
mirrored in outward foreign direct investment (FDI) from India
which showed a significant increase to US $ 5.4 billion in the
first quarter of 2007-08 as compared to US $ 1.1 billion a year
ago. Net portfolio investment by foreign institutional investors
(FIIs) turned around with inflows of US $ 7.1 billion during the
first quarter of 2007-08 as against an outflow of US $ 1.8 billion
a year ago. The impact of the reduction in ceiling on interest
rates during January and April 2007 resulted in non-resident
Indians (NRI) deposits recording a net outflow of US $ 0.4 billion
in the first quarter of 2007-08, a turnaround from net inflows of
US $ 1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2006-07. Inflows under
American Depository Receipts/Global Depository Receipts
(ADRs/GDRs) amounted to US $ 308 million in April-June 2007.
35.
Reflecting the movements in current and capital accounts
of the balance of payments, the accretion to foreign exchange
reserves (excluding valuation) amounted to US $ 11.2 billion
during the first quarter of 2007-08 as against US $ 6.4 billion
a year ago. Taking into account the valuation gain of US $ 3.0
billion, the level of foreign exchange reserves amounted to
US $ 213.4 billion at the end of June 2007.
36.
India’s external debt increased by US $ 8.7 billion during
April-June 2007 and amounted to US $ 165.4 billion at
end-June 2007. While multilateral debt registered a moderate
increase of US $ 317 million, there was a marginal decline of
US $ 417 million in bilateral debt. ECB increased by US $ 5.5
23

billion while there was an increase of US $ 1.0 billion in
short-term trade credits. Valuation gains on account of the
appreciation of the US dollar vis-à-vis other major international
currencies added US $ 1.2 billion to the stock of external debt.
The US dollar had a dominant share of 50.4 per cent in India’s
external debt whereas rupee-denominated debt had a share of
18.0 per cent. The ratio of short-term debt to total debt increased
marginally to 7.9 per cent at end-June 2007 from 7.6 per cent at
end-March 2007. The ratio of foreign exchange reserves to
external debt was 129.0 per cent at the end of June 2007 as
compared with 127.1 per cent at end-March 2007.
37.
These developments appear to have gained ground in
the second quarter of 2007-08. According to the DGCI&S,
merchandise exports rose by 18.2 per cent in US dollar terms
during April-August 2007 as compared with 27.1 per cent in the
corresponding period of the previous year. Import growth was
higher at 31.0 per cent as compared with 20.6 per cent in the
previous year. Non-oil imports rose by as much as 44.3 per cent
(10.9 per cent a year ago); oil imports, however, slowed down to
6.0 per cent (44.5 per cent), mainly on account of moderation in
the price of the Indian basket of crude oil by 0.5 per cent during
April-August 2007 (US $ 68.0 per barrel) as against an increase
of 30.2 per cent during April-August 2006 (US $ 68.4 per barrel).
On the other hand, oil import in volume terms increased by 18
per cent during April-May 2007 as compared with 13 per cent in
April-May 2006. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit
widened to US $ 32.5 billion during April-August 2007 from
US $ 19.9 billion in April-August 2006. There are also indications
of a substantial increase in remittances received from Indians
working abroad as well as sustained resilience and growth in
exports of software and IT enabled services.
24

38.
Available information points to a scaling up of various
elements of net capital flows in relation to their levels a year ago
and even in the preceding quarter. Portfolio flows have picked
up strongly on account of FIIs, amounting to US $ 21.2 billion
during 2007-08 (up to October 19) as compared to an inflow of
US $ 0.9 billion in the corresponding period of 2006-07. Gross
FDI inflows during April-July 2007 were placed at US $ 6.6
billion as compared with US $ 3.7 billion a year ago. Approvals
for ECBs amounted to US $ 8.7 billion during April-June 2007
as compared with US $ 4.4 billion in the corresponding period
last year. On the other hand, there were net outflows under NRI
deposits of US $ 148 million in April-July 2007 as compared
with inflows of US $ 1,585 million during April-July 2006. ADR/
GDR issues by Indian companies amounted to US $ 2.3 billion
during April-July 2007 as against an inflow of US $ 1.5 billion in
the corresponding period in the previous year. The foreign
exchange reserves increased by US $ 62.0 billion and stood at
US $ 261.1 billion on October 19, 2007.
39.
The exchange rate of the rupee against the US dollar,
which was Rs.43.59 at end-March 2007, appreciated
thereafter to reach Rs.41.24 at end-August 2007 and
strengthened further to Rs.39.51 per US dollar as on October
26, 2007. The rupee appreciated by 10.3 per cent against
the US dollar, by 2.4 per cent against the euro, by 5.4
per cent against the pound sterling and 7.1 per cent against
the Japanese yen during the current financial year up to
October 26, 2007.
40.
The exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided
by the broad principles of careful monitoring and management
of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or a
25

pre-announced target or a band, coupled with the ability to
intervene, if and when necessary. The overall approach to the
management of India’s foreign exchange reserves takes into
account the changing composition of the balance of payments
and endeavours to reflect the ‘liquidity risks’ associated with
different types of flows and other requirements.
Developments in the Global Economy
41.
Since late July, global financial markets have experienced
bouts of turbulence and high volatility with the unfolding of the
US sub-prime mortgage crisis. A freezing of credit markets spread
rapidly to equity, currency and bond markets with disorderly
re-pricing of risk in all segments. The deterioration in sentiment
has affected consumer confidence with apprehensions of potential
economy-wide effects in the US. Global economic activity,
however, appears so far to have been resilient in the face of the
heightening of volatility in international financial markets in the
third quarter of 2007. Fundamentals remain strong in other large
industrial countries as well as in most emerging market
economies, especially in Asia which as a region is running current
account surpluses with reduced public debt. Nevertheless, the
downside risks to the outlook have increased from a few months
ago, accentuated by the recent financial market turmoil. Firm
inflationary pressures and high and volatile crude prices are
other risks to the outlook. Consensus expectations continue to
support a broad-based economic expansion for 2007, although
heightening of uncertainties is recognised. According to the World
Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) released in October 2007, the forecast for global real GDP
growth on a purchasing power parity basis has been retained at
5.2 per cent for 2007 as in the July 2007 update, down from 5.4
26

per cent in 2006. The IMF has, however, revised the forecast for
2008 down to 4.8 per cent in October from 5.2 per cent in the
July 2007 update.
42.
In the US, real GDP growth had risen to 3.8 per cent in
the second quarter of 2007 as compared with 2.4 per cent a
year ago, reflecting growth in net exports, commercial structures
and inventories, partly offset by a decrease in residential fixed
investment. The IMF’s October 2007 WEO now expects the US
economy to grow at a slower pace of 1.9 per cent in 2007 and
2008 as against 2.9 per cent in 2006.
43.
Real GDP in the euro area grew by 2.5 per cent in the
second quarter of 2007 on a year-on-year basis as compared
with 2.9 per cent a year ago. Unemployment held steady in
August 2007 for the third month running at a record low of 6.9
per cent. Expansionary economic forces are predicted to prevail
in the second half of 2007 in Germany – the largest euro area
economy – with pick-up in domestic demand, production and
exports. The October 2007 update of the IMF’s WEO has placed
average annual real GDP growth of the euro area at 2.5
per cent in 2007 and 2.1 per cent in 2008.
44.
The Japanese economy grew by 2.3 per cent in the
second quarter of 2007 as compared with 2.1 per cent a year
ago and moderate expansion is likely to continue in the second
half of 2007, aided by gains in household spending which offset
the decline in corporate outlays. Going ahead, business
investment should be an important driver, with high capacity
utilisation and profits. In addition, the negative contribution from
stock building in recent quarters suggests that inventory
accumulation would add to growth. The October 2007 WEO of
27

the IMF has projected real GDP growth in Japan at 2.0 per cent
in 2007 and 1.7 per cent in 2008.
45.
In emerging Asia, economic activity has continued to
expand at a sustained pace, especially in the largest economies
of the region, despite the existence of a volatile global setting
with strengthening commodity prices and abundant liquidity. The
Chinese economy grew by 11.5 per cent in the third quarter of
2007 as compared with 10.6 per cent a year ago. The
deceleration in China’s economic growth from 11.9
per cent in the second quarter has been attributed to policy
efforts to curb high-polluting, energy-intensive industries as well
as monetary tightening policies adopted in the first half, reduction
of export rebates and restrictions on processing exports. Inflation
accelerated to 6.5 per cent in August 2007 from 1.3
per cent a year ago, and moderated only slightly to 6.2 per cent
in September. China is expected to grow by 11.5 per cent in
2007 and by 10 per cent in 2008, but inflation may remain at a
level higher than the central bank’s target of 3.0 per cent. The
impact of losses of China’s financial institutions and the
transmission of financial turmoil to China’s markets seems to be
limited.
46.
The People’s Bank of China (PBC) has raised interest
rates seven times since April 2006 to 7.29 per cent and has
raised cash reserve requirements eleven times between July
2006 and September 2007. In recent months, the PBC has cut
the rebate on VAT taxes and has increased export taxes on
some products to discourage the balance of payment surpluses
and reduce funds flow to the stock markets which have reached
elevated levels. China ran a record US $ 185.7 billion trade
surplus in the first nine months of 2007, 69.0 per cent higher
28

than in the same period last year, which has contributed to the
overhang of liquidity in the economy. China’s foreign exchange
reserves reached US $ 1.4 trillion at the end of September
2007, remaining the key driver of domestic liquidity and
contributing to asset price pressures.
47.
Among other major Asian economies, the Korean economy
grew by 5.8 per cent in the third quarter of 2007, higher than 4.8
per cent a year ago. Exports continue to post robust growth and
domestic demand is showing a steady increase, led by
consumption. The upward trend of real estate prices has been
blunted by the tightening measures taken by the authorities since
2006. The Korean economy is expected to grow by 4.8 per cent
in 2007, slower than 5.0 per cent in 2006. Consumer price
inflation had accelerated to 2.3 per cent in September 2007
from 1.7 per cent in January 2007. The Bank of Korea has
taken tightening steps in 2006 and 2007 by raising its policy
rate, increasing reserve requirements, cutting the ceiling on
aggregate loans to commercial banks for lending to small and
medium enterprises and has attempted to curb the steady rise
in property prices by restricting mortgage loan issuance to one
contract per person, introduction of price ceilings on new houses
and disclosure of construction cost of new homes.
48.
In the second quarter, the Thai economy has registered a
growth of 4.4 per cent, lower than 5.0 per cent a year ago.
The Bank of Thailand introduced a series of measures to
stem strong capital inflows into the economy in 2006 and 2007,
although monetary policy setting has eased in the context of the
moderation in growth. Growth is projected to slowdown to 4.0
per cent in 2007 from 5.0 per cent recorded in 2006, but is
expected to recover to 4.5 per cent in 2008.
29

49.
Inflationary pressures remain a key risk to global growth.
In the global foodgrains market, prices have been rising in
response to the surging demand for major crops such as corn,
soybeans and wheat whose prices have increased by 10
per cent, 55 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively, from a year
ago. The rally has swept up prices of other commodities such
as barley, sorghum, eggs, cheese, oats, rice, peas, sunflower
and lentils. The increase in prices has been also driven up by
higher energy and fertiliser prices, low levels of inventories,
shortfalls in certain crops mainly caused by weather-related
factors such as the ongoing drought in Australia and strong
increases in the demand for crops. The latter reflects mainly two
new emerging sources of demand, which include US Government
incentives that are encouraging businesses to turn corn and
soybeans into motor fuel and the growing economies of Asia
and Latin America which are enabling their large populations to
spend more on food. The price of corn, the main feedstock for
ethanol production in the United States, rose at the beginning of
the year to ten-year highs. As this encouraged US farmers to
increase their corn production, they decreased the supply of
other agricultural products, with a subsequent upward impact on
the prices of these products in world markets.
50.
Wheat prices, currently at historically high levels, face a
second consecutive small world wheat crop in 2007 and
tightening supplies, extremely strong export demand for US wheat
and declining world wheat inventories. Production is estimated
to be 10.1 million tonnes less than the projected level of world
consumption, pointing to a decline in world stocks for the sixth
time in seven years. The increasingly tight supply situation has
prompted the European Union to scrap limits on grain production
imposed 15 years ago which required farmers to set aside 10
30

per cent of their arable land every year. One month wheat futures
at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) rose sharply to
US $ 9.53 per bushel on October 1, 2007 from US $ 4.19 on
April 3, 2007 before falling to US $ 8.03 on October 26, 2007.
The 2007 cereals crop is now estimated to fall below last year’s
level of 2.0 billion tonnes because of dry and unusually hot
weather in April, followed by adverse summer weather in parts
of Europe. At the global level, closing wheat stocks in 2007-08
are expected to fall to a historically low level, especially in the
major exporting countries.
51.
Global coarse grain imports and exports for 2007-08
are increasing mostly as a result of increased demand for
feed-grain supplies in Europe, reflected in higher US exports
of corn, sorghum and barley. The futures prices of corn on
CBOT, which had moderated somewhat up to July, started
moving up thereafter and reached US $ 3.73 per bushel on
October 26, 2007. Global rice production is projected at a lower
level than a year ago due mostly to a decrease in production in
China and North Korea, offset partially by small increases in
the US, Iraq and Kazakhstan. Global rice stocks have reached
a 30-year low leading to an upward pressure on prices. The
futures prices of rice on CBOT rose from US $ 9.76 per bushel
in end-March 2007 to US $ 11.75 on September 27, 2007
before declining marginally to US $ 11.65 on October 26, 2007.
Sugar prices, which reached a 25-year high in early 2006,
have declined steadily since then due to a much larger global
output than anticipated in most cane-producing countries,
particularly Brazil and India. The futures prices of sugar
moderated from US cents 11.51 per pound in January 2007 to
US cents 8.45 on June 13, 2007 before moving up to US cents
10.13 on October 26, 2007.
31

52.
Russia is introducing price controls on some basic foods
in an effort to prevent spiralling prices, mainly in the form of
agreement between the country’s prominent food retailers and
producers. The Government intends to freeze prices at October
15, 2007 levels on select food products, viz., bread, cheese,
milk, eggs and vegetable oil until the end of the year, with retail
mark-up limited on these goods to 10 per cent. The possibility of
increasing the export tariff on wheat from 10 per cent to 30 per
cent to enhance domestic supplies is also being explored. These
indications have lent upward pressure to wheat prices in major
world markets. China has also indicated an inclination to impose
food price controls; Egypt, Jordan, Bangladesh and Morocco
are increasing subsidies or cutting import tariffs to lower domestic
prices. Even advanced economies such as Italy are affected by
the food price increases with visible popular discontent.
53.
Metal prices have increased by 1.6 per cent during the
first nine months of 2007, over and above the increase of
53.6 per cent in 2006 and 36.3 per cent in 2005. According to
the futures markets, aluminium, zinc and lead prices are
showing an upward trend. Copper prices have been buoyed
up by the depreciating US dollar. Future price of copper on
New York Metal Exchange increased to a record level of US
$ 3.75 per pound on July 20, 2007 but moderated subsequently
to US $ 3.53 on October 26, 2007. Spot gold rose to
US $ 785 an ounce on October 26, 2007 – the highest since
January 1980 - as the dollar fell to a record low against the
euro, boosting the demand for the precious metal as an
alternative asset.
54.
Crude oil prices, which softened from the July-August
2006 peak of US $ 78 per barrel to around US $ 53 per barrel in
32

January 2007, have rebounded since July 2007 to close at a
record level of US $ 91.7 on October 26, 2007 on renewed
tension in the Middle East, low US crude stocks, weak US
economic data and the easing of the US dollar against other
major currencies. Futures prices for crude oil have moved up to
US $ 91.86 per barrel. Barring a slowdown in oil demand growth,
continued high demand and low surplus capacity leave the crude
oil scenario vulnerable to unexpected supply disruptions through
2008. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA),
the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is expected
to remain at US $ 68.84 per barrel in 2007 and US $ 73.50
per barrel in 2008.
55.
In the US, consumer prices increased from 2.1 per cent
in January 2007 to 2.8 per cent in September 2007, after declining
to 2.0 per cent in August 2007. In the euro area, inflation
has increased to 2.1 per cent in September 2007 from 1.7
per cent a year ago. Inflation became negative at (-) 0.2
per cent in Japan in September 2007 from 0.6 per cent in
September 2006. In the UK, CPI inflation declined to 1.8 per
cent in September 2007 from 2.4 per cent a year ago. At the
retail level, (Retail Prices Index) inflation rose to 4.8 per cent in
the UK in March 2007 - the highest since 1991 - but declined
thereafter to 3.8 per cent in July 2007 before increasing to 3.9
per cent in September 2007. Inflation pressures have raised
concerns in some of the emerging market economies (EMEs)
such as China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Chile.
56.
Core CPI inflation in the US decelerated to 2.1 per cent
in August 2007 and remained at the same level in September
2007 as against 2.2 per cent in July 2007. In the UK, core CPI
inflation has been declining in tandem with the headline rate
33

and stood at 1.5 per cent in September, down from 1.8 per cent
in August 2007. In the euro area, core CPI inflation declined to
1.8 per cent in September 2007 after remaining at 1.9 per cent
over February-August 2007. Core inflation in Japan remained
negative (-0.3 per cent) in September 2007 as compared with
(-) 0.2 per cent in August 2007. Overall, the expected persistence
of high food prices, sustained elevated oil prices along with
continued high prices of other commodities, pose significant
inflation risks for the global economy, which are likely to set
continuing challenges for monetary policy worldwide.
57.
There was a sudden fall in credit market confidence in
late July brought on by the spread of risks from exposure to the
US sub-prime mortgages. Downturn in sentiment affected higher
quality asset classes fairly rapidly including equity, currency,
corporate bond and emerging market debt segments. These
unusual developments indicated heightening uncertainties and
emerging challenges for the conduct of monetary policy,
especially for EMEs. In the subsequent weeks, these risks
became accentuated by solvency threats to hedge funds and
even large international banks, especially in Europe, with their
usual lenders stopping short-term credit lines. Financial markets
remained highly unsettled over the next few days amidst fears
of a global credit crunch spreading into corporate bond markets
and equity markets.
58.
The responses of the central banks to the recent events
in financial markets have shown that concerns for financial
stability can assume overriding importance. This is evident in
the fact that central banks initially reacted by injecting liquidity,
including through special facilities and the expansion of eligible
securities for collateral, rather than through interest rate cuts.
34

Central bankers have indicated their willingness to consider other
courses of action in favour of protecting growth. In order to
prevent a spike in short-term interest rates (which in Europe
shot up to 4.7 per cent as against the European Central Bank’s
benchmark rate of 4 per cent), the European Central Bank and
the Fed have intervened since August 9 by providing liquidity to
the inter-bank market. They were joined by central banks in
Canada, Japan, Australia, Norway and Switzerland. Major central
banks have continued to inject liquidity since then and the Bank
of England has provided liquidity support to a mortgage lending
bank, while giving a blanket guarantee to depositors on the
safety of their deposits. The US Federal Reserve has highlighted
“unusual funding needs because of dislocations in money and
credit markets.” While the European Central Bank described its
operations as fine-tuning, it noted that there are tensions in the
euro money market notwithstanding the normal supply of
aggregate euro liquidity. The US Federal Reserve cut its policy
rate by 50 basis points on September 18, 2007 both to promote
growth and in the interest of financial stability.
59.
There are several features characterising the recent turmoil
in financial markets which distinguishes it from the historical
experience. First, the instability in the financial markets has
stemmed from exposures of financial institutions to lower grade
credit in the US, in sharp contrast to earlier crises which were
associated with turbulence emanating from EMEs as in
May-June 2006 and in February 2007. Second, in contrast to
earlier episodes, instability is not restricted to a crunch in the
credit markets but is spilling into money markets (including for
commercial paper) as well as currency, equity and corporate
bond markets. Third, these developments have sparked off a
flight to safety and investors are increasingly abandoning riskier
35

assets and less collateralised/ lower rated assets in favour of
US treasuries. Fourth, there is widespread concern that the
purveyors of the current bout of turbulence are either too lightly
regulated or not regulated at all. In this context, the role of
external credit rating agencies has come in for considerable
criticism for not responding in a timely fashion and for misjudging
credit risk embedded in complex derivative instruments. Fifth,
although the current turmoil appears to have been triggered by
solvency threats to major hedge funds, the impact on financial
markets has been cushioned by a combination of large private
bail-outs, limits on redemptions and orderly winding ups. Sixth,
the insufficiency of private effort is reflected in the coordinated
and sizeable liquidity injections conducted by major central banks
in order to prevent volatility in money markets and adverse effects
on banks. Seventh, intervention of some central banks has
included the acceptance of mortgage-backed securities in open
market operations. While this has prevented massive sell-offs of
good quality assets, there are fears that this has amounted to
regulatory forbearance and would eventually cascade into either
large official bail-outs and/or force an easing of monetary policy
contrary to the commitment to anchoring inflation expectations.
In mid-October 2007, in an effort to reassure financial markets
by providing easier funding and to complement other solutions,
the US Treasury has facilitated a plan led by major US banks to
set up a fund of about US $ 100 billion which is expected to act
as a buyer for highly rated assets from structured investment
vehicles for a set period of time. This plan is still under discussion
and is yet to be implemented. These efforts to restore liquidity to
credit markets have provoked some scepticism about appropriate
valuations, manner of disbursements and realistic assessments
of risks embedded in the structured products involved in
the refinancing.
36

60.
Despite the volatility in the US equity markets in the third
quarter of 2007 (July-September), the Dow Jones Industrial
Average ended the quarter by posting a 3.6 per cent rise while
the S&P 500 managed a quarterly increase of 1.5 per cent and
the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite posted gains of 3.8
per cent for the quarter. Globally, considerable volatility was
experienced in the world equity markets especially in EMEs –
with indicators reporting record single day falls in mid-August.
With the strong recovery in EME stock markets thereafter,
diversified emerging markets funds gained substantially in the
third quarter. Developed markets turned in mixed results. Tracking
US stocks, the international large-cap growth category posted a
quarterly advance of 4.3 per cent, while funds with a value-stock
orientation struggled to break even. Currency markets have
recorded a tentative return to stability and re-establishment of
carry trades, but worries about emerging market currencies –
that were previously relatively isolated from the turmoil – have
surfaced with emerging market bonds coming under selling
pressure. In the US, corporate bond spreads have widened
across all credit grades and are currently around their highest
levels in several years. Spreads on emerging market sovereign
bonds have also widened over the past two months, although to
a lesser extent than those on lower-rated corporate bonds in the
US. A notable aspect of the reduced investor appetite for
corporate debt has been the cancellation or postponement of a
number of leveraged buyout (LBO) debt issues.
61.
Government bond yields in the major economies,
which had until recently firmed up, have softened more recently.
The US 10-year bond yield increased from 4.70 per cent at
end-December 2006 to 5.29 per cent on June 12, 2007 before
falling to 4.40 per cent on October 26, 2007. The 10-year bond
37

yields in the euro area increased from 3.95 per cent at
end-December 2006 to 4.68 per cent on July 9, 2007 before
falling to 4.17 per cent. The Japanese 10-year bond yield
has increased from 1.68 per cent at end-December to 1.97
per cent on June 13, 2007 before falling to 1.62 per cent.
These recent developments are indicative of evolving
uncertainties in international financial markets with implications
for EMEs.
62.
On a trade-weighted basis, the US dollar has been
depreciating since 2006 with intermittent fluctuations. After the 50
basis points cut in the Fed funds rates announced on September
18, 2007, the US dollar has weakened against other currencies.
The pound sterling rose to the level of US $ 2.05 on October 26,
2007 – fractionally lower than the 26-year high of US $ 2.06
reached on July 24, 2007 – amidst concerns relating to the
sub-prime mortgage market. The euro, which has also been
strengthening against the US dollar since June, rose sharply on
July 24 on investor apprehensions about sub-prime mortgage
exposures and surged to a fresh high of US $1.44 on October 26,
2007. The Canadian dollar appreciated against the US dollar to a
33-year high to reach US $ 1.04 on October 26, 2007. Turkey
experienced a sharp appreciation in its currency vis-a-vis the US
dollar on October 5, 2007 to reach the level of 84.98 cents,
before declining to 84.28 cents on October 26, 2007. The New
Zealand dollar had appreciated to 81.10 cents to reach a 22-year
peak against the US dollar on July 24, 2007 before declining to
76.53 cents on October 26, 2007.
63.
Several central banks have cut policy rates during the
third quarter of 2007 after financial markets were significantly
affected by turbulence. On September 18, 2007 the US Federal
38

Reserve cut back its policy rate by 50 basis points to 4.75
per cent after seventeen increases of 25 basis points each
between June 2004 and June 2006. The Banco Central do Brasil
has cut the Selic rate target eighteen times between September
2005 and September 2007 to 11.25 per cent. Earlier, policy
rates have been reduced by Bank Indonesia (BI) (BI rate reduced
from 12.50 per cent in May 2006 to 8.25 per cent in July 2007)
and the Bank of Thailand (1-day repurchase rate reduced from
4.75 per cent in January 2007 to 3.25 per cent in July 2007 in
four stages).
64.
The central banks that have tightened their policy rates
include the European Central Bank which has raised its policy
rates eight times since December 2005 by 25 basis points each
to 4.00 per cent (main refinancing rate); the Bank of England
(repo rate raised in August and November 2006, January, May
and July 2007 by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent); the Bank of
Japan (uncollateralised overnight rate target at 0.25 and 0.50
per cent in July 2006 and February 2007, respectively, after
maintaining a zero interest rate policy since September 2001);
the Bank of Canada to 4.50 per cent (in July 2007); the Reserve
Bank of Australia (Cash Rate raised by 25 basis points each in
August and November 2006 to 6.25 per cent and in August
2007 to 6.50 per cent); the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Official
Cash Rate raised to 8.25 per cent by five 25 basis points hikes
in December 2005 and March, April, June and July 2007); the
People’s Bank of China (lending rate raised seven times to 7.29
per cent between April 2006 and September 2007); the Bank of
Korea (target overnight call rate raised by 25 basis points each
in August 2006, July and August 2007 to 5.00 per cent); the
Banco de Mexico (benchmark overnight lending rate raised to
7.50 per cent in October 2007 from 7.25 per cent in April 2007);
39

and the Banco Central de Chile (benchmark lending rate raised
to 5.75 per cent in September 2007 from 5.00 per cent since
January 2007).
65.
A few central banks in Asia have used supplementary
measures for tightening, besides increasing key policy rates. In
China, the required reserve ratio was raised by 50 basis points
each effective from July 5, August 15 and November 15 in 2006
and on January 15, February 25, April 16, May 15, June 5,
August 15, September 25 and October 25 in 2007. The required
reserve ratio in China is currently 13.0 per cent. The Bank of
Korea raised reserve requirements from 5 per cent to 7 per cent
for local currency deposits and short-term foreign currency
deposits, after a gap of 17 years, in November and December
2006, respectively, in addition to other measures referred to
earlier. Meanwhile, in several EMEs including China and Korea,
central bank bonds have continued to absorb liquidity from the
banking system. The only central bank that has kept policy rates
steady is the Bank Negara Malaysia (Overnight Policy Rate at
3.5 per cent since April 2006).
Overall Assessment
66.
Growth in agricultural output in the first quarter was
expected to benefit from the strong improvement in the 2006-07
rabi output, particularly, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses;
however, the overall strength of the supply response from the
sector has turned out to be above consensus expectations. In
the second quarter, agricultural activity has been well supported
by moisture conditions, with rainfall in the current season being
above normal and reasonably well-distributed, and reasonably
high reservoir levels. Kharif sowing has been higher than in last
40

year’s season and first estimates are reflecting expectations of
higher production than in the preceding year. These
developments have improved the outlook for agriculture which
appears set to return to its trend growth in 2007-08. The positive
prospects for agriculture augur well for the economy as a whole
in terms of both aggregate supply conditions and food prices
which, until early 2007, were the main drivers of inflation.
67.
Notwithstanding a modest deceleration in the growth of
overall industrial activity in the first five months of 2007-08, the
manufacturing sector continued to record double-digit growth.
There are indications that industrial activity continues to be
sustained by strong fundamentals. Growth in basic metals,
chemicals, wood and wood products and machinery and
equipment has retained buoyancy, together contributing more
than half of the growth in industrial production in April-August
2007. Growth in electricity a key infrastructural input has
accelerated in the current financial year. The growth of capital
goods production has remained strong and higher than headline
industrial output growth, suggesting continued capacity
expansion. Contraction in output has occurred mainly in the
consumer goods segment, transport equipment, metal products,
paper and textiles, which could be reflecting transitory factors.
68.
While industrial activity continues to display an inherent
momentum, there are indications that headline industrial growth
is being affected by the large variations recorded in the preceding
year. Accordingly, on the basis of available data as well as the
uncertainties surrounding global developments, marginal
moderation in overall industrial activity over the rest of 2007-08
may not be ruled out within the generally positive prospects for
the industrial sector.
41

69.
Despite some moderation reflected in lead indicators, the
services sector has continued to grow at a sustained pace,
particularly in the financial sub-sector, trade, transport, hospitality
and construction, reflecting robust investment activity as well as
a pick-up in demand with farm incomes rising on the back of the
improvement in agricultural performance in the first quarter of
2007-08. These impulses have been supported by the growth of
insurance premiums, telecommunication subscribers and tourist
arrivals. While there has been some deceleration in railway freight
traffic, lead indicators generally support a positive outlook for
service sector activity although, due to the uncertainty surrounding
the evolution of the global economy, the possibility of marginal
moderation in growth over the rest of 2007-08 cannot be
ruled out.
70.
Aggregate demand conditions have remained firm and
on the uptrend. First, the key driver of the economy appears to
be the substantial increase in gross fixed investment in the first
quarter of 2007-08, indicative of the strong pace of capacity
building underway. In contrast, the growth in private consumption
and exports has been relatively modest. Investment-driven growth
is supported primarily by saving rates, currently at around 32-33
per cent of GDP and higher by ten percentage points from the
beginning of the decade. The step-up in gross domestic saving
has been enabled by private corporate saving which has nearly
doubled between 2002-03 and 2005-06 on the back of strong
growth in profitability. There has also been some improvement
in public sector saving which has turned positive after persistent
dis-saving up to 2003-04. Interestingly, the momentum in
investment has not been affected by changes in the interest rate
cycle and spending on capital expenditure and infrastructure
has weathered the transient slack in industrial activity in the
42

second quarter. Second, the key monetary aggregates, i.e.,
reserve money and money supply have been running well above
initial projections, reflecting the impact of higher than expected
deposit growth and the exogenous expansionary effects of capital
inflows as well as the drawdown of fiscal cash balances. Within
the monetary expansion, bank credit growth appears to have
been slowing down, but from excessively high rates of the
preceding four years. Third, the merchandise trade deficit has
widened sizeably, despite reasonably strong export growth,
attesting to the spillover of domestic demand into the external
sector. Fourth, asset prices remain at elevated levels, although
there is some anecdotal evidence of stabilising real estate prices.
On the other hand, equity prices are at record highs. Fifth,
although inflation in terms of wholesale prices appears to have
eased considerably, it still remains high in terms of consumer
prices, particularly those facing agricultural workers and rural
labourers.
71.
Key monetary and banking aggregates have exhibited
contrasting variations in the second quarter of 2007-08. On the
one hand, reserve money expansion has been sizeable,
persisting above 23.8 per cent throughout the quarter, and has
been driven up mainly by the Reserve Bank’s net foreign currency
assets and variations in the Centre’s cash balances, partly offset
by liquidity absorptions under the MSS and the LAF. Against the
backdrop of primary liquidity movements, the rate of money
supply, which has averaged 20.9 per cent year-on-year through
the quarter in contrast to indicative projections for policy purposes,
has warranted intensified monitoring. Propelling money supply
is the sustained buoyancy in time deposits, reflecting the
migration of current, savings and postal deposits in response to
relatively attractive returns and tax benefits for longer term bank
43

deposits, corporate profits and banks’ investments in mutual
funds (which reappear as mutual funds’ deposits with the banking
system), apart from the environment of expansion in the monetary
base. On the other hand, non-food credit growth has moderated
in alignment with the trajectory set in the Annual Policy Statement
of April 2007. Sectoral data suggest that this moderation has
been in respect of all the major sectors, while incremental
non-food credit offtake in respect of the industrial sector has
increased. With deposit growth remaining strong, the deceleration
in non-food credit as well as disinvestment of non-SLR assets
has resulted in augmenting market liquidity, partly mitigated by
a build up of SLR–eligible securities. Critical indicators such as
a rising incremental investment/deposit ratio, a decline in
non-food credit deposit ratio and sustained profit growth are
reflecting these shifts and point to signs of growing resilience in
the banking system’s balance sheet with favourable implications
for financial stability, going forward.
72.
The expansionary monetary and financial conditions
characterising the second quarter of 2007-08 and the policy
response in the form of active liquidity management operations
launched in the First Quarter Review were reflected in a generally
orderly evolution of market liquidity. Consequent upon the
withdrawal of the ceiling on daily reverse repos under the LAF
with effect from August 6, absorptions of liquidity by the Reserve
Bank resumed after a hiatus spanning March-July. Initial large
daily reverse repo bids moderated in subsequent weeks but
remained close to an average of Rs 30,000 crore until September
interspersed by periods of relatively lower absorptions. Since
October 1, 2007 ample liquidity in financial markets has resulted
in large daily absorptions through LAF reverse repo auctions,
despite sizeable absorptions under the MSS. The Central
44

Government vacated ways and means advances/overdrafts, but
cash balances of the Centre exhibited considerable volatility
within an overall downward movement that augmented market
liquidity through August and the first half of September. In the
following week, these cash balances were built up coincident
with the quarterly advance tax payments, but have been drawn
down through October augmenting market liquidity. Broadly,
however, the primary source of liquidity expansion was the
sizeable accretion to the Reserve Bank’s net foreign currency
assets. In response, sterilisation through the MSS operations
picked up in early August and increased steadily over the
remaining part of the quarter. Surplus liquidity conditions were
also reflected in excess SLR holdings by banks and their
investments in mutual funds.
73.
A notable development in the second quarter of 2007-08
has been the steady retreat of headline WPI inflation from
mid-July. The receding of WPI inflation over July-October 2007
has been discernible across commodities and also in exclusionbased measures (WPI excluding energy; WPI excluding
food and energy), but pronounced in the category of primary
food articles and, particularly, under vegetables, milk, rice and
oilseeds. On the other hand, inflation in the category of
manufactured products and non-food primary articles has been
relatively less relenting.
74.
While the recent headline inflation outcomes, juxtaposed
with expectations survey results and information from financial
markets, are indicative of reasonably well-anchored inflation
expectations, some of the recent developments have shown
that there are major risks to this assessment that are still evolving.
First, CPI inflation rose in July with the price rise for rural and
45

agricultural labourers exceeding 8.5 per cent in August, i.e., the
softening of wholesale food prices has not set in at
the retail level. Second, the global environment is fraught
with uncertainties. International crude prices are volatile
at new highs, having breached the level of US $ 90 per barrel
while elevated food and metal prices would, in current
circumstances, pass through to domestic inflation. The
incomplete pass-through of international prices of crude,
metals, food and commodities in general to consumer prices is
indicative of suppressed inflation which carries destabilising
potential into the future. Third, the state of monetary and
liquidity conditions evoke traditional concerns that they could
carry the seeds of future inflation. Fourth and most
importantly, the expansion of global liquidity conditions in the
wake of the recent financial market turmoil has occurred
in a period when concerns about firm inflation expectations
were being reflected in a withdrawal of accommodation in
the monetary policy stance of countries across the world,
both mature and emerging. The massive injection of
liquidity by mature central banks reflects a deviation from
their stance on inflation in order to ensure financial stability
which could potentially weaken their ability to fight inflationary
pressures.
75.
Domestic money markets have exhibited orderly behaviour
and surplus liquidity conditions generally, except when equity
markets turned volatile primarily in response to global
developments. A notable feature is the muted impact of
mid-September advance tax outflows on money markets in the
current financial year, indicative of active monetary and liquidity
management. In the foreign exchange market, large inflows have
imposed persistent upward pressures on the exchange rate of
46

the rupee which have become accentuated in the wake of the
50 basis points cut in the US Federal Funds target rate on
September 18. In the Government securities market, orderly
conditions have prevailed through the quarter with yields firming
mildly during mid-July to mid-August in response to the
sub-prime crisis in the US. Thereafter, yields have edged down,
reflecting underlying liquidity conditions and benign inflation
expectations.
76.
Finances of the Central Government appeared to be under
some strain during April-August 2007. Buoyant tax collections
seem to have been neutralised by higher expenditure on interest
payments and subsidies. Consequently, the revenue deficit
exceeded the BE for 2007-08 by July 2007. Transfer of surplus
from the Reserve Bank and the accounting of the SBI stake sale
under non-tax revenue (as against under non-debt capital receipts
indicated earlier) enabled some pull-back of the revenue deficit
vis-à-vis the BE in August 2007. The gross fiscal deficit, even
adjusted for the SBI stake sale was also above BE in AprilAugust reflecting, in addition to the revenue deficit, a sharp rise
in non-defence capital expenditure. As regards financing, market
borrowings for the first half of 2007-08 have been completed
broadly in accordance with the announced calendar. There has,
however, been a higher recourse to short-term borrowings and
WMA/overdraft from the Reserve Bank in comparison to the
position last year, mainly on account of the SBI stake sale.
77.
While there has been some progress in fiscal rectitude, it
is important to take note of some adverse features in the finances
of the Central Government during 2007-08 so far. Excluding the
transfer of the Reserve Bank’s stake in the SBI, the revenue
deficit for April-August 2007 is placed at 122.9 per cent of the
47

BE for the full year (2007-08) as compared with 93.7 per cent a
year ago. Furthermore, there has been a sharp increase in
expenditure under all categories with total expenditure rising by
40 per cent over the level in the corresponding period of the
previous year. In view of the priority attached to ensuring stability
in the context of the recent heightening of global uncertainties, it
is necessary to persevere with fiscal consolidation consistent
with the FRBM Rules through prudent expenditure management
while also ensuring the quality of expenditure by both the Centre
and the States.
78.
Several aspects of recent developments in the external
sector of the economy merit attention. First, domestic demand
pressures are strongly in evidence, driving up non-oil imports
and the merchandise trade deficit in the first half of 2007-08,
notwithstanding some saving on account of subdued POL import
growth. Second, while merchandise exports have continued to
exhibit innate dynamism and resilience in the face of adverse
price/cost and global developments, moderation in pace seems
to be setting in when viewed in perspective against the recent
high growth phase, i.e., 2003-07. Third, lead indicators suggest
that the buoyancy characterising net invisible receipts has been
sustained. In view of these developments, the current account
deficit in the first half of 2007-08 is expected to have been
contained at the level of a year ago. Fourth, net capital flows to
India have increased substantially in the wake of the recent
turmoil in international financial markets and the response of
major central banks in terms of injecting liquidity into money
markets in their economies. In particular, the sizeable turnaround
in portfolio flows in the current financial year has been noteworthy.
Fifth, while FDI to India has been running higher in the current
financial year, it is necessary to note that a significant proportion
48

of these flows are attributable to private equity and venture
capital which are essentially in the nature of portfolio flows.
Sixth, an important feature of external sector developments is
the rising volume of FDI from India, representing the silent
transformation in India’s interface with the world being driven by
Indian corporates leveraging their domestic balance sheets to
gain scale, scope and global scan. Seventh, the increasing size
of debt flows – mainly ECB and trade credits, since NRI deposits
are responding to policy initiatives – and consequently, increasing
external indebtedness needs to be noted. Eighth, India recorded
the third highest accretion to foreign exchange reserves in AprilSeptember, 2007 among all EMEs. At US $ 261 billion at midOctober 2007, India holds the world’s fifth largest stock of
international reserves, sufficient to cover 15 months of imports/
17 months of debt service/ 127 per cent of external debt/ 69 per
cent of international liabilities.
79.
The First Quarter Review of July, 2007 warned of the
dark shadow cast by the under-priced and widely diffused risks
emanating from the unfolding of the US sub-prime mortgage
crisis. Since late July, global financial markets have experienced
unusual volatility, strained liquidity and heightened risk aversion.
There have been sharp movements in major financial markets,
in particular in money and credit markets since early August.
While the trigger was the rising default rates on sub-prime
mortgages in the US, the source of the problem was arguably
not macro-global imbalances but certainly significant mis-pricing
of risks in the financial system. Easy monetary policy in major
financial centres, globalisation of liquidity flows, wide-spread use
of highly complex structured debt instruments and inadequacy
of banking supervision in coping with financial innovations also
contributed to the severity of the crisis. The persistent under49

pricing of risks was suspected by several central banks for quite
some time, but it was felt by many that since risks were now
widely dispersed through financial innovation they would not
pose any serious problems to the system. When the sub-prime
crisis did occur, however, it triggered a wide contagion affecting
many of the largest of the world’s financial institutions. Banks, in
particular, appear to have ceased to trust each other’s
creditworthiness leading to freezing of money markets in the
US, Europe and the UK and hence lack of liquidity. This has
resulted in each financial institution shoring its own liquidity to
meet its obligations. The problems of maturity mis-matches in
the conduits or structured investment vehicles (SIVs) created by
the banks for purposes of securitisation manifested themselves
in a sudden great demand for liquid assets. This is deemed
necessary in order to cope with adjustments which could
potentially arise, including the possible need to take back the
conduits or SIVs into the balance sheets of sponsoring banks or
the winding up of such vehicles. During the process of adjustment,
which is apparently still underway, there are problems of markingto-market of securitised debt instruments in highly illiquid markets
and transparency in regard to counter-party risks. Contrary to
initial expectations, even with the release of end-September
accounts of major international banks, the picture remains
somewhat unclear.
80.
The central banks in major countries have had to take
recourse, in appropriate mix, to three instruments to avoid serious
spill-over of these issues in money or credit markets into the
wider economy : (i) adjustment of interest rates for borrowing
and lending; (ii) money market operations designed to inject
special liquidity in order to avoid a break-down in payment
systems among banks, and (iii) to put in mechanisms for financial
50

transactions among the largest of the financial intermediaries
which automatically impact the second and third rung
intermediaries. Central banks in major industralised economies,
by and large, responded with injection of liquidity for a longer
period than is usually done; they also resorted to dilution in the
quality of collateral required for liquidity support, and in some
cases, reduction in rates. Most of these operations have not
been conducted at the penal rates expected in such situations.
This is an unprecedented package which, some observers
believe, is indicative of the seriousness of the underlying
problems. In addition, there were two specific-institution oriented
operations, namely, in Germany to bail out a public sector bank
and in the United Kingdom to bail out a private sector bank,
coupled with open-ended Government guarantee for all public
deposits in financial institutions. The US Federal Reserve has
been the most aggressive in terms of monetary policy actions,
with a higher than expected rate cut, reflecting the concerns
over impact of housing issues on consumption and, hence,
growth. These measures have restored some order to the
financial system, though concerns remain on how the situation
will unfold.
81.
There are several immediate issues which need to be
visited constantly to track the evolution of the resolution of the
problem and consequent impact on India. First, there is debate
as to how smoothly the new injection of liquidity will impact
global liquidity and potential inflation. Second, there are concerns
about the size, location and impact of credit infirmities. There is
a view that credit infirmities are small and, in any case dispersed;
there is another view that mutual funds, pension funds and
insurance companies, which are perceived to be less rigorously
regulated than banks, may be adversely affected. In the latter
51

case, households could be severely impacted. Third, while some
believe that the adjustment will be smooth since it is only a
mismatch of maturities in asset-liabilities, others argue that equity
and currency markets cannot but be affected at some stage. In
other words, there is a view that the current situation could have
the potential for serious financial contagion globally. Fourth, an
issue of special interest is whether the problem will remain
confined to the financial sector and get resolved over time sooner
or later, or whether there would be a real sector impact. It is
believed that some large corporates have been active in the
financial sector through treasury operations and commodity
markets. While the impact on consumption in the US is
anticipated, a fiscal impact is not ruled out. Fifth, there is a view
that US housing prices have to undergo a significant correction.
There is, however, debate over what period this will happen,
whether it will have significant consumption and saving effects
and the manner in which it will spill over into the global economy.
Another issue of interest is whether there will be similar housing
price corrections in other countries since housing prices are
seen by many to be inflated in many economies. Finally, as far
as emerging markets are concerned, there could be a negative
impact if the credit markets are affected through the real
economy. In select cases, some EMEs may turn out to be second
order safe-havens with consequent implications for capital flows,
exchange rates and their alignment with economic fundamentals.
82.
It is also useful to recognise some positive elements in
the global economy. First, the global economy has proved to be
strong and resilient in recent years. The real economy is robust,
except in a few countries, notably the US, which, in turn, has
impressive flexibilities. Second, EMEs, by and large, have a
better macro-environment than before and can hence contribute
52

possibly to global output and stability. Third, globally, corporate
balance sheets are strong and less leveraged than in the past,
thus adding to comfort. Fourth, the large financial intermediaries
are perhaps adequately capitalised to absorb the shocks of credit
infirmities. Fifth, the inflation environment has been, on the whole,
benign though incipient pressures, especially due to oil prices,
food grains, ample liquidity and possible transmission of upward
pressure on prices in China, in the recent past, should not be
ignored.
83.
There are five determining factors in the manner in which
the current issues would unfold as the exit from the current
turbulence occurs. First, how quickly and durably the counterparty
transparency would be established among the large financial
intermediaries, despite the common interest in resolving the issue.
The major hurdle would be the fact that the financial markets
are integrated globally while the regulatory and transparency
regimes are national. The issues of burden-sharing among the
institutions/jurisdictions could impact the search for early and
meaningful transparency. For example, an issue is the method
of marking to market, in a credible manner, instruments that are
virtually illiquid and opaque. Second, it is now recognised that
there has been excessive leverage and hence the next steps
should be de-leveraging on a massive scale, with implications
for cost of capital for such an exercise. Third, it is also recognised
that excessive disintermediation by the banks has been an
important factor. Hence, the next steps should be
re-intermediation, namely, bringing the off-balance sheet items
of banks back on to their balance sheets with attendant calls on
capital of banks at a time when confidence in financial system is
under stress. In brief, there are reasons to believe that risks are
so widespread and financial innovations have enabled such
53

multi-layering at the expense of transparency that significant
segments of the financial sector are closer to a black box than
ever before.
84.
The most important issue for India is the possible impact
of these developments in financial markets and policy responses
by central banks in major economies. For convenience, the
analysis could be made in terms of financial sector, balance
sheet, trade and inflation channels. In regard to the financial
sector channel, the primary channel in India is through the equity
markets. The currency markets are affected through equity market
players or in the guise of equity market players. It is possible to
take positions in equity even if the sole motive is currency
speculation or ‘carry trade’. However, the movements in currency
cannot but affect the real sector as a whole, not merely exporters,
as is often believed. Domestic industry could be impacted through
the pressure of higher imports since trade is open but this will
only become evident with a time lag. In terms of balance sheets,
Government, households, corporates and financial intermediaries
have, relative to many other EMEs, lower exposure but are not
immune to the impact. Large corporates with overseas borrowings
or plans for mergers and acquisitions may face constraints due
to possible re-pricing of risks and risk aversion in credit markets.
The trade channel will also be an important channel, especially
if there were to be a slowdown in the US. India’s export basket
is diversified but software exports are critical. Past experience
shows that there are occasions when a slowdown in the US did
not dampen the off-shoring to India. However, the impact on the
competitiveness of software due to large movements in currency
could be a new factor yet to be fully assessed. Finally, the
inflation channel could be critical both from demand and supply
side. Liquidity that is injected in the US and the euro area to
54

manage the financial turmoil cannot be fully confined to those
economies, thus potentially adding to excess liquidity in India
also through renewed capital flows. The supply side pressures
in regard to oil and food do not appear to be abating. The
evolution of inflation pressures requires enhanced vigilance. In
brief, as far as first order effects are concerned, the major issues
relate to financial contagion, and potential inflation, and the
possibility of real sector impact as the second order effect. The
policy challenge is to ensure financial stability and persevere
with managing inflation – the tasks identified in the First Quarter
Review of the monetary policy and the emerging challenges
appear to be daunting. As of now, only a marginal slowdown in
global output growth is anticipated and by all indications output
growth in India in the short-run may be marginally impacted.
The immediate task for public policy in India, therefore, is to
manage the possible financial contagion which is in an incipient
stage with highly uncertain prospects of being resolved soon.
85.
At the current juncture and looking ahead, there are
several complexities facing the conduct of monetary policy in
India. On the domestic front, the biggest challenge is the
management of capital flows and the attendant implications for
liquidity and overall stability. A visible reflection of the sheer
magnitude of the inflows is the accretion to the foreign exchange
reserves which has been of the order of US $ 62 billion during
the current financial year up to October 19, of which US $ 48
billion has been built up since end-June 2007. In response, the
Reserve Bank has engaged in an active management of liquidity
through a combination of instruments at its disposal. The total
amount of issuances under the MSS has gone up by 159
per cent over the end-March 2007 level and by 102 per cent
over the end-June 2007 level, enabling sterilisation of capital
55

flows of the order of Rs.1,12,292 crore during the current financial
year so far up to October 26, 2007. In addition, liquidity absorbed
in the form of net reverse repos under the LAF has been
Rs.47,320 crore since end-March 2007 – five times the amount
in the corresponding period of 2006-07. The CRR was raised by
100 basis points in July 2007 over and above the cumulative
increase of 100 basis points during December 2006-March 2007.
During 2007-08 up to October 26 on a fortnightly average basis,
a total amount of Rs.54,198 crore has been additionally
impounded through the CRR from SCBs, an increase of 235 per
cent over that absorbed in the corresponding period of the
preceding year.
86.
While monetary policy has operated reasonably well on
the domestic demand-supply and credit-deposit balances even
as liquidity emanating from capital flows has been absorbed in
the short run, the key future challenge is liquidity management,
taking into account the current levels of capital flows. The
persistence of these flows has implications for domestic financial
stability and future inflation with potential lagged effects on
aggregate demand. Consequently, monetary policy will have to
address not only the liquidity overhang but also incremental
flows in the future if they continue at present levels. In this
regard, there are some signs of efforts towards active
management of capital flows in public policy which needs to be
taken into account in setting the monetary policy stance. It is
necessary, however, to continuously and carefully monitor how
persistent and effective these measures will be in terms of their
impact on managing expectations in financial markets.
87.
Yet another challenge for the conduct of monetary policy
in the context of recent domestic developments is the rapid
56

escalation in asset prices, particularly equity and real estate,
which are significantly driven by capital flows. These pools of
capital, which are private, often opaque, highly leveraged and
largely unregulated, have the potential for heightening risks to
the domestic financial system and posing threats to overall
financial stability as well as the prospects for growth. In view of
the size of business accruing to these flows in mergers and
acquisition activity, stock markets and in real estate, monetary
policy will have to contend with the risks to overall macroeconomic
stability and threats to inflation expectations emanating from
fluctuations in asset prices, the re-pricing of risks and their
diffusion across the financial system.
88.
Threats to inflation in the future emanate not only from
domestic liquidity conditions but also from the underlying global
pressures. The possible impact of injection of liquidity by central
banks to meet the recent turbulence in global financial markets
on global inflation is not yet clear. In any case, globally, pressures
on future inflation are embedded in the high and volatile levels
of international crude prices as well as prices of food and metals.
Furthermore, the sharp increase in inflation in China can get
transmitted to major trading partners, given the dominant position
of China in the global economy today. Hence, over the next
twelve to eighteen months, risks to inflation and inflation
expectations would continue to demand priority in policy
monitoring.
89.
It is important to recognise that large fluctuations in
financial markets have deep-seated and lasting effects on the
real sectors of the economy, output and employment. At this
stage of development of the Indian economy, the formulation of
monetary policy has to be acutely sensitive to the impact of
57

excessive market volatility on the real sector with feedback effects
on the financial sector. Furthermore, the burden on monetary
policy is larger in view of the limited room for manoeuvre for
fiscal policy. It is in the context of these developments that
monetary policy has to be vigilant and proactive in cushioning
the real economy from excess volatility in financial markets.
90.
In the overall assessment, the strategy of active liquidity
management with a combination of measures used flexibly and
often pre-emptively in view of the recognition of their lagged and
cumulative effects appears to be yielding positive outcomes.
First, domestic developments reflect the dominance of investment
demand which has favourable implications in terms of expanding
future aggregate supply. Second, there have been strong and
sustained imports of capital goods which would augment
productive capacity and enhance the elasticity of the supply
response in the period ahead. Third, notwithstanding some
moderation in headline industrial production, the production of
capital goods has maintained its growth momentum, reinforcing
aggregate supply conditions and attesting to the underlying
strength of investment demand and the ongoing expansion of
capacity in conjunction with imports of capital goods. Fourth,
business confidence has generally remained buoyant in
recognition of the strength of the fundamentals and the resilience
of macroeconomic management. Fifth, while there has been a
decline in the production of consumer durables, it is important to
recognise elements of correction, normalising the excesses of
the past that are being reflected in rising defaults on bank lending
to the sector. Sixth, there has been a moderation of the mismatch
in banks’ balance sheets and rebalancing between credit and
deposit growth has occurred.
58

91.
Despite these positive developments, monetary
aggregates such as reserve money, money supply and liquidity
are expanding at unacceptably high levels, essentially driven by
capital inflows, warranting priority in policy attention and posing
extraordinary challenges for the conduct of monetary policy going
forward. Furthermore, the escalated level of prices of real estate,
the role of private foreign equity and non-bank financial
companies, and the still strong pace of growth in bank lending
to the sector is a cause for concern. In addition, the sizeable offbalance sheet exposures of select banks could pose some risks
in a few cases. On balance, domestic conditions, by and large,
have evolved so far in line with policy objectives and expectations
as set out in the Annual Policy Statement in April 2007. In the
period ahead, continuous watchfulness in regard to food and
crude prices, asset prices, monetary and liquidity conditions and,
above all, developments in global financial as well as commodity
markets would be critical. The policy challenge for the Reserve
Bank is to manage the current transition to a higher growth path
while containing inflationary pressures and focusing on financial
stability. Contextually, maintaining enhanced vigilance to be able
to respond appropriately to the prevailing heightened uncertainties
in global financial and monetary conditions assumes vital
importance.

59

II. Stance of Monetary Policy for the
Second Half of 2007-08
92.
At the end of July 2007, risks to the outlook for global
growth and financial markets had become accentuated
by adverse developments in the US sub-prime mortgage
market. Regulators and monetary authorities were expressing
concern about the global financial system in the context of
rising levels of widely diffused risks. Accordingly, banks,
financial institutions and corporates in India were advised
to be vigilant and well-prepared with appropriate risk mitigation
strategies to deal with significantly higher volatility than
before and to monitor various types of exposures with
appropriate hedging of risks to balance sheets. In view of
the continuing uncertainty regarding the full dimensions
and characteristics of the crisis in developed financial markets,
banks, financial institutions and corporates are urged to
enhance their vigilance with respect to the possibility of
unfolding risks arising from global developments. In this context,
they should ensure hedging of risks embedded in various types
of exposure and put in place appropriate risk-management
strategies to protect their balance sheets and preserve asset
quality. Furthermore, banks need to step up their monitoring of
similar risks that could affect corporates that have international
market exposure.
93.
With domestic economic activity seen as expanding
strongly and inflation expectations well anchored, the First Quarter
Review noted that monetary policy in India would continue to be
vigilant and pro-active in the context of any accentuation of
global uncertainties that pose threats to growth and stability in
the domestic economy. It was also indicated that while the stance
60

of monetary policy would continue to reinforce the emphasis on
price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations and thereby
sustain the growth momentum, contextually, financial stability
may assume greater importance in the months to come. The
First Quarter Review reiterated the stance of the Annual Policy
Statement for 2007-08 of reinforcing the emphasis on price
stability and well-anchored inflation expectations while ensuring
a monetary and interest rate environment that supports export
and investment demand in the economy so as to enable
continuation of the growth momentum. Credit quality and orderly
conditions in financial markets for securing macroeconomic and,
in particular, financial stability were re-emphasised while
simultaneously pursuing greater credit penetration and financial
inclusion. A readiness to respond swiftly with all possible
measures as appropriate to the evolving global and domestic
situation impinging on inflation expectations, financial stability
and the growth momentum was also reiterated.
94.
Developments in global financial markets in the immediate
aftermath showed that several risks associated with global
developments that were indicated in the First Quarter Review
have materialised, vindicating the emphasis on vigilance and
preparedness in the context of global uncertainties. First, the
sudden fall in credit market confidence brought on by the spread
of the sub-prime loan risks into higher quality debt unsettled
financial markets across the world. The response of monetary
authorities provides an indication of the threat to growth and
financial stability. Second, a sympathetic and sustained surge in
international crude prices has added to the building uncertainty;
despite alternating movements, the volatility of crude prices
around elevated levels may crystallise into potential second round
effects impacting inflation expectations. Third, food prices have
61

continued to rule at historically high levels with no immediate
relief from improvement in global supply conditions. Consequently,
consumer price inflation has hardened in a number of countries,
with food importers being most adversely affected. The persistence
of inflationary pressures presents a dilemma for monetary
authorities in the context of the immediate need for assuaging
liquidity and solvency stress in the context of financial stability.
95.
Domestic macroeconomic developments have exhibited
enduring strength and resilience. First, growth has been sustained
and has broadened. In particular, the improvement in agricultural
supply conditions in conjunction with the sustained pace of
industrial and service sector activity is indicative of an acceleration
in the underlying momentum of the economy above the projected
trajectory. Second, considerable success has been achieved in
lowering inflation and in anchoring inflation expectations. The
environment of price stability has entrenched the foundations of
a higher growth path for the economy. Third, financial markets
have, by and large, exhibited orderliness in the face of the turmoil
in global markets. Fourth, while the merchandise trade deficit
has widened, the strength of invisible earnings has kept the
current account deficit at a level that is modest in comparison
with the net capital flows. As a consequence, there has been a
sizeable accretion to the foreign exchange reserves as in the
preceding year.
96.
The First Quarter Review of July 2007 had indicated that
potential uncertainties in global markets and recent developments
in domestic financial markets warrant a higher priority for
managing appropriate liquidity conditions in the policy hierarchy.
By and large, the combination of measures that were put in
place has worked satisfactorily in terms of returning overnight
62

interest rates to the LAF corridor and ensuring that they generally
evolve in an orderly manner. Nevertheless, financial markets
continue to experience conditions of surplus liquidity, warranting
an appropriate response in order to ensure orderly market
conditions on an enduring basis.
97.
Real GDP growth originating in agriculture and allied
activities has risen above trend in the first quarter of 2007-08 and
is poised to maintain this performance over the rest of the year on
the back of a favourable south-west monsoon and improvement
in sown acreage. Recent developments indicate some slackening
of momentum in the industrial and services sectors. Moreover,
global uncertainties may have some moderating influence on the
performance of manufacturing as well as services. Overall, these
sectors are expected to sustain the momentum of growth.
Accordingly, real GDP growth in 2007-08 is placed at 8.5 per cent
for policy purposes, as set out in the Annual Policy Statement of
April 2007 and reiterated in the First Quarter Review, assuming
no further escalation in international crude prices and barring
domestic or external shocks.
98.
The gains achieved in reining in inflation in the first
quarter of 2007-08 have been extended into the second quarter
and currently headline inflation appears to be emerging out
of a prolonged trough. At this juncture, however, rising and
volatile international crude prices and the heightened levels of
food prices pose risks to the inflation outlook. In view of the
persisting high levels of the price of the Indian crude basket,
some pass-through to domestic petroleum product prices appears
reasonable. A key issue going forward in this regard
is the timing of the pass-through in the context of the
expected path of headline inflation. The policy resolve going
63

forward should be to consolidate the success in lowering
inflation on an enduring basis so that an environment of
stability prevails to nurture and protect the transition to higher
growth. There are indications that the public’s perceptions on
inflation are increasingly converging with the policy preference
for price stability. Accordingly, in view of the lagged and
cumulative effects of monetary policy on aggregate demand and
assuming that supply management would be conducive,
capital flows would be managed actively and in the absence
of shocks emanating in the domestic or global economy,
the policy endeavour would be to contain inflation close to
5.0 per cent in 2007-08. In recognition of India’s evolving
integration with the global economy and societal preferences in
this regard, the resolve, going forward, would be to condition
expectations in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent so that an
inflation rate of around 3.0 per cent becomes a medium-term
objective consistent with India’s broader integration into the
global economy.
99.
Money supply has so far been expanding well above the
indicative trajectory of 17.0 -17.5 per cent set in the Annual
Policy Statement of April 2007. Fiscal spending and exchange
market interventions have mainly driven this acceleration as
reflected in sizeable reserve money growth. Deposit growth has
been running ahead of the projection of Rs.4,90,000 crore for
2007-08 as a whole. Non-food credit (inclusive of non-SLR
investments) has decelerated and is currently close to the
projection of 24.0-25.0 per cent given in the Annual Policy
Statement. However, moderating the expansionary effects of
net capital flows is warranted so that money supply is not
persistently out of alignment with the indicative projections set
out in the Annual Policy Statement.
64

100. The Reserve Bank will continue with its policy of active
demand management of liquidity through appropriate use of the
CRR stipulations and open market operations (OMO) including
the MSS and the LAF, using all the policy instruments at its
disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants.
101. In sum, barring the emergence of any adverse and
unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy
and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy
including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary
policy in the period ahead will broadly continue to be:
• To reinforce the emphasis on price stability
and well-anchored inflation expectations while ensuring
a monetary and interest rate environment that supports
export and investment demand in the economy so as
to enable continuation of the growth momentum.
• To re-emphasise credit quality and orderly conditions
in financial markets for securing macroeconomic and,
in particular, financial stability while simultaneously
pursuing greater credit penetration and financial
inclusion.
• To respond swiftly with all possible measures as
appropriate to the evolving global and domestic situation
impinging on inflation expectations, financial stability
and the growth momentum.
• To be in readiness to take recourse to all possible
options for maintaining stability and the growth
momentum in the economy in view of the unusual
heightened global uncertainties, and the unconventional
policy responses to the developments in financial
markets.
65

III. Monetary Measures
(a)

Bank Rate

102. The Bank Rate has been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent.
(b)

Repo Rate/Reverse Repo Rate

103. The repo rate under the LAF is kept unchanged at 7.75
per cent.
104. The reverse repo rate under the LAF is kept unchanged at
6.0 per cent.
105. The Reserve Bank has the flexibility to conduct repo/reverse
repo auctions at a fixed rate or at variable rates as circumstances
warrant.
106. The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight
or longer term repo/reverse repo under the LAF depending on
market conditions and other relevant factors. The Reserve Bank
will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or
reject tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit,
so as to make efficient use of the LAF in daily liquidity
management.
(c)

Cash Reserve Ratio

107. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks is currently
at 7.0 per cent. On a review of the current liquidity situation,
it is considered desirable to increase the CRR by 50 basis
points to 7.5 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning
November 10, 2007.
Third Quarter Review
108. The Third Quarter Review of the Annual Policy Statement
on Monetary Policy will be undertaken on Tuesday, January 29,
2008.
66

Part II. Mid-term Review of Annual Statement
on Developmental and Regulatory Policies
for the Year 2007-08
109. The Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 emphasised
the need for credit quality and orderly conditions in financial
markets for securing macroeconomic and, in particular, financial
stability while pursuing greater credit penetration and financial
inclusion. In consonance, the Annual Policy Statement on
Regulatory and Developmental Policies set out measures in terms
of issuance of guidelines on derivatives; implementation of
Basel II; restructuring of advances including advances to SMEs;
differentiated bank licenses; bank finance to factoring companies;
enhancement of disclosures; know your customer (KYC) norms/
anti-money laundering (AML) standards; credit information
companies; and convergence with international best practices.
In this context, drawing up of a road-map for introduction of
currency and interest rate futures was proposed along with
ongoing liberalisation of foreign exchange transactions.
110. The First Quarter Review of July 2007 intensified policy
monitoring in the context of high volatility in equity and currency
markets. Banks, financial institutions and corporates were advised
to be vigilant and well prepared with appropriate risk mitigation
strategies to deal with significantly higher volatilities than before.
It was indicated that contextually, financial stability would assume
greater importance in the months to come.
111. Going forward, the Reserve Bank would continue to
balance the development of a sound, efficient and diversified
financial system that facilitates smooth transmission of monetary
policy with financial inclusion in which satisfactory customer
67

services are rendered by financial institutions/intermediaries.
Credible communication, adequate availability of information and
a broad-based, participative and consultative approach will shape
the conduct of developmental and regulatory policies in respect
of the financial system.
112. The Mid-term Review of the Annual Statement on
Developmental and Regulatory Policies focuses on certain key
areas: new financial instruments and prudential requirements;
liberalisation of foreign exchange transactions; strengthening risk
management in banks; migration to Basel II; fine-tuning of
supervisory processes in response to financial innovations and
consolidation in the banking sector and business processes;
ongoing development and integration of various segments of
financial markets; and improved credit delivery mechanisms with
specific focus on the developmental needs of agriculture and
small and medium enterprises and inclusive growth.
113. This Review is divided into four sections: I. Financial
Markets; II. Credit Delivery Mechanism and Other Banking
Services; III. Prudential Measures; and IV. Institutional
Developments.
I. Financial Markets
114. The Reserve Bank has consistently emphasised the
importance of developing financial markets as well as operational
flexibility for market participants in various segments in an
environment secured by effective regulation and oversight.
115. The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Money,
Foreign Exchange and Government Securities Markets has
68

provided valuable guidance to the Reserve Bank in the context
of its developmental and regulatory role vis-à-vis financial
markets. The Committee has met three times since the
announcement of the Annual Policy Statement in April 2007.
Government Securities Market
116. The Reserve Bank has endeavoured to broaden and
deepen the Government securities market in terms of participants,
instruments and processes. Consequent upon the implementation
of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM)
Act, 2003 and withdrawal of the Reserve Bank from the primary
segment, development of the Government securities market has
assumed vital importance.
(a) State Government Borrowings
(i)

Market Borrowings of States:
Information Dissemination

117. In consultation with State Governments, the information
on gross allocation inclusive of net allocation, additional allocation
and repayments during 2007-08 and the amount that could be
raised during the remaining period of 2007-08 as market
borrowings by State Governments was disseminated through a
press release in September 2007.
(ii) Non-Competitive Bidding Scheme in the Auctions
of State Development Loans: To be Operationalised
118. The Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 proposed to
introduce a ‘Non-Competitive Bidding Scheme’ in the auctions
of State Development Loans (SDLs) in the financial year
69

2007-08 following discussions with State Governments.
Accordingly, a scheme for Non-Competitive Bidding Facility was
incorporated in the Revised General Notification issued by all
State Governments on July 20, 2007. The scheme would be
operationalised by March 31, 2008.
(iii) Reissuance of State Government Securities
119. Reissuance of SDLs has been favoured with a view to
building up a critical mass of stock in the gilt market thereby
improving the secondary liquidity of such securities. The Reserve
Bank, in consultation with State Governments, has proposed to
introduce a system of reissuances. Responses received from
State Governments in this regard are being examined and it is
proposed to re-issue SDLs in the second half of 2007-08.
(iv) Power Bonds
120. Under the scheme for one-time settlement of outstanding
dues of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs) to Central Public
Sector Undertakings (CPSUs), power bonds for an aggregate
amount of Rs.31,581 crore were issued by 27 State
Governments. The repayment of these power bonds started from
the year 2006-07. State Governments could exercise the call
option for full or part prepayment of their outstanding power
bonds on April 1, 2008 as per the terms and conditions of the
respective Notifications.
(b) Central Government Securities
Floating Rate Bonds
121. With a view to simplifying the methodology for pricing of
floating rate bonds (FRBs) in the secondary market, the Annual
Policy Statement of April 2007 had proposed to examine the
70

change in valuation methodology in consultation with Fixed
Income Money Market and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA)/
Primary Dealers’ Association of India (PDAI). Accordingly, a new
issuance structure for FRBs has been approved by the TAC on
Money, Foreign Exchange and Government Securities Markets
and the facility to handle the new issuance structure is being built
into the new Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) auction system
being developed by the Clearing Corporation of India Limited
(CCIL). This is expected to be completed by March 31, 2008.
(c) Development of Market Infrastructure
(i)

Repos in the Corporate Bond Market

122. The High Level Expert Committee on Corporate Bonds
and Securitisation (Chairman: Dr. R.H. Patil) had recommended,
inter alia, the establishment of a trade reporting platform for
better price discovery. The Securities and Exchange Board of
India (SEBI) has since operationalised the reporting platforms
managed by the two exchanges, namely, the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), as
well as the industry body, the FIMMDA. As the corporate debt
markets develop and the Reserve Bank is assured of availability
of fair prices, and an efficient and safe settlement system based
on delivery versus payment (DvP) III and Straight Through
Processing (STP) is in place, the Reserve Bank is committed to
permitting market repos in corporate bonds.
(ii) Reporting Platform for Interest Rate Swaps
123. In the Annual Policy Statement of April 2007, it was
announced that the CCIL would develop a trade reporting platform
for Rupee Interest Rate Swaps (IRS). The platform has since
71

been operationalised on August 30, 2007 and banks and Primary
Dealers (PDs) have started reporting the IRS and Forward Rate
Agreements (FRAs) trades on the platform on a daily basis.
(iii) Interest Rate Derivatives
124. Interest rate futures were introduced in India in June 2003.
In the context of continued financial market developments, the
Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 had proposed to set up a
Working Group under the aegis of the TAC on Money, Foreign
Exchange and Government Securities Markets to study and
suggest measures to facilitate the development of the interest
rate futures market. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has
constituted a Working Group on Interest Rate Futures (Chairman:
Shri V.K. Sharma) which would review the experience gained so
far with interest rate futures with particular reference to product
design issues and make recommendations for activating the
instrument. The Group would also revisit the recommendations
of the earlier Committees in this area and examine regulatory
requirements as well as the scope and extent of participation of
non-residents while making its own recommendations. The report
would be placed on the Reserve Bank’s website within three
months (by December 31, 2007) after further discussions with
the TAC on Money, Foreign Exchange and Government Securities
Markets.
(iv) Market Stabilisation Scheme:
Revision of Ceiling
125. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed
between the Government of India and the Reserve Bank on
March 25, 2004 detailing the rationale and operational modalities
of the MSS. The Government of India, in consultation with the
72

Reserve Bank, has periodically raised the ceiling on the
outstanding obligations of the Government of India by way of
issuance of bills/securities under the MSS for the year 2007-08
to the level of Rs.2,00,000 crore as on October 4, 2007. The
Reserve Bank announces the auctions under the MSS, if any,
for the succeeding week every Friday.
(v) Guidelines on ‘Short Sales’ and
‘When Issued’ Transactions
126. Currently, ‘Short sale’ and ‘When Issued’ transactions are
undertaken on the Negotiated Dealing System - Order Matching
(NDS-OM) system only. In order to provide further flexibility to
participants, it is proposed:
•

to permit covering of ‘Short-sale’ and ‘When Issued’
transactions outside the NDS-OM system.

127. Guidelines in this regard would be issued in consultation
with the FIMMDA and the PDAI.
(vi) CSGL Option on NDS-OM
128. The screen-based order driven anonymous NDS-OM
module was operationalised in August 2005 for trading in
Government securities. Access to the module was initially
extended to banks and PDs and later to other NDS members
including insurance companies, mutual funds and bigger
provident funds for their proprietary deals. Constituent trading
on the NDS-OM was enabled from May 2007 and access to
the system was extended to certain ‘qualified entities’, including
deposit taking non-banking financial companies (NBFCs)
maintaining gilt accounts with NDS members. It is
73

now proposed:
•

to include systemically important non-deposit taking
NBFCs (NBFC-ND-SI) as ‘qualified entities’ for
accessing the NDS-OM using the CSGL route.

Foreign Exchange Market
129. The Reserve Bank has taken several initiatives to
rationalise and simplify the procedures in the conduct of foreign
exchange transactions with a view to facilitating prompt and
efficient customer service. Keeping in view the recommendations
of the Committee on Fuller Capital Account Convertibility
(CFCAC), a number of measures were taken towards
liberalisation of foreign exchange transactions.
130. The pace of implementation of the recommendations of
CFCAC was accelerated with regard to foreign exchange
outflows. These measures include: (i) permitting Indian companies
as well as registered partnership firms to invest in overseas joint
ventures (JV)/wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS) up to 400
per cent of the their net worth under the automatic route;
(ii) increasing the existing limit of 35 per cent of the net worth for
portfolio investments by listed companies to 50 per cent of the
net worth and dispensing with the requirement of 10 per cent
reciprocal share holding in the listed Indian companies by
overseas companies; (iii) increasing the existing limit for
prepayment of external commercial borrowings (ECBs) without
the Reserve Bank’s approval from US $ 400 million to US $ 500
million, subject to compliance with the minimum average maturity
period; (iv) increasing the aggregate ceiling for overseas
investments by mutual funds registered with the SEBI from
US $ 4 billion to US $ 5 billion while continuing with the existing
74

facility of investing up to US $ 1 billion in overseas Exchange
Traded Funds that may be permitted by the SEBI; and
(v) enhancing the existing limit under the Liberalised Remittance
Scheme (LRS) for resident individuals from US $ 100,000 to
US $ 200,000 per financial year.
131. In the context of recent global and domestic developments
and with a view to giving an opportunity to small and medium
enterprises to manage the challenges in global markets, the
Reserve Bank, in consultation with the Government of India,
permitted all exporters as a temporary measure, to earn interest
on their Exchange Earners’ Foreign Currency (EEFC) accounts
to the extent of outstanding balances of US $ 1 million per
exporter. This facility would be valid up to October 31, 2008 and
banks are free to determine the rate of interest.
132. In addition, the coverage of the interest subvention scheme
in respect of rupee export credit to specified categories of
exporters was widened and the validity of the scheme was
extended by three months from December 31, 2007 to March
31, 2008.
(a) Expansion of Hedging Facilities
133. The range of hedging tools available to the market
participants has been further expanded keeping in view the
evolution of foreign exchange market.
Forward Contracts
Hedging Facility for Exporters and Importers
134. Under extant guidelines, exporters and importers are
permitted to hedge on the basis of declaration of an exposure
and based on past performance criteria as specified. Market
75

participants have represented to the Reserve Bank that the facility
of hedging under the past performance route may be available
on a continuous basis. In order to facilitate exporters and
importers to hedge their exposures on a dynamic basis, it is
now proposed:
•

to permit reinstatement of the eligible limits under
the past performance route to the extent that
supporting underlying documents are produced during
the term of the hedge undertaken; and

•

the reinstatement facility would not, however, be
available for contracts already cancelled under the
scheme.

Oil Refining and Marketing Companies
135. With a view to facilitating hedging of foreign exchange
exposure in respect of oil companies, it is proposed:
•

to permit oil companies to hedge their foreign
exchange exposures to the extent of 50 per cent of
their inventory volume as at the end of the previous
quarter by using overseas over-the-counter (OTC)/
exchange traded derivatives up to a maximum of
one year forward.

(b) Currency Futures
136. The Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 proposed to
set up a Working Group on Currency Futures to study the
international experience and suggest a suitable framework to
operationalise the proposal within the existing legal and regulatory
framework. Accordingly, an Internal Working Group on Currency
76

Futures (Chairman: Shri Salim Gangadharan) was set up which
studied, inter alia, the experiences of some emerging market
economies where currency futures exchanges have been
functioning within an environment of capital controls. The Group
considered the views of a wide cross section of stakeholders,
including banks, industry associations, domestic and international
exchanges, and has had extensive and detailed consultations
with market participants in the TAC on Money, Foreign Exchange
and Government Securities Markets. The Group has explored
various options for the proposed currency futures exchange,
particularly on aspects like participation, clearing and settlement,
market intermediaries, margins, contract design and surveillance
mechanism. The draft report of the Group would be placed on the
Reserve Bank’s website for comments by November 15, 2007.
(c) Derivatives
137. The Reserve Bank had constituted an Internal Group for
preparing consolidated guidelines on derivatives. Based on the
recommendations of the Group in respect of foreign exchange
derivatives, the following measures are proposed with a view to
providing greater flexibility to the residents:
(i)

Writing of Options

138. Currently, corporates are allowed only to purchase options
on a stand-alone basis. In certain cases, corporates are permitted
to write options as part of a zero cost structure. It is now
proposed:
•

to allow importers and exporters having foreign
currency exposures to write covered call and put
options in both foreign currency/rupee and cross
currency and receive premia.
77

(ii) Running Options Book
139. In terms of extant guidelines, authorised dealers (ADs)
desirous of running options books in foreign currency rupee
options are permitted to do so, subject to approval by the Reserve
Bank. In order to enable the ADs to manage their risks efficiently,
it is proposed:
•

to permit ADs to run cross currency options books,
subject to the Reserve Bank’s approval.

(iii) Types of Options
140. Under extant guidelines on foreign currency rupee options,
ADs are permitted to offer only plain vanilla European options.
In keeping with the gradual evolution of the foreign exchange
market and based on market demand, it is now proposed:
•

to permit ADs to offer American options as well.
II. Credit Delivery Mechanisms and
Other Banking Services

141. It has been the endeavour of the Reserve Bank to address
the developmental needs of sectors of the economy that are
disadvantaged in the credit market, especially agriculture and
SMEs, by improving credit delivery mechanisms and making
available basic banking services to the widest sections of the
society without procedural hassles. Initiatives taken in this regard
include refocus on employment-intensive sectors under priority
sector lending; simplification of the procedures for obtaining
agricultural loans; reduction of risk weight on loans extended
against gold and silver; augmenting credit flow to distressed
78

farmers; revival of the cooperative structure and regional rural
banks (RRBs); development of new avenues of credit
dispensation such as micro-finance institutions; and legislation
for regulating money lending, deepening financial inclusion and
improving customer services.
(a) Delivery of Credit to Agriculture and
Other Segments of Priority Sector
142. Domestic scheduled commercial banks, both public and
private, are required to formulate special agricultural credit plans
(SACP) in order to achieve a distinct improvement in flow of
credit to agriculture. During 2006-07, disbursements to agriculture
by public sector banks (PSBs) and private sector banks under
SACP aggregated Rs.1,22,443 crore and Rs.25,360 crore
(provisional), respectively, as against the target of Rs.1,80,160
crore and Rs.40,656 crore. Since the inception of the kisan
credit card (KCC) scheme in 1998, PSBs have issued 27.27
million KCCs covering an amount of Rs.1,00,226 crore. During
2007-08 (up to June 30), PSBs have issued 0.66 million KCCs
covering limits aggregating Rs.5,514 crore (provisional). The
Union Budget, 2007-08 has announced establishment of the
Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) XIII with the
National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)
with a corpus of Rs.12,000 crore and a separate window under
the RIDF XIII for rural roads under the Bharat Nirman Programme
with a corpus of Rs.4,000 crore. Since the inception of the RIDF,
the total allocation under the RIDF (I to XII) was of the order of
Rs.64,000 crore. While cumulative sanctions to State
Governments and the National Rural Roads Development Agency
(NRRDA) under various tranches of the RIDF (I to XII) stood at
Rs.61,312 crore and Rs.4,000 crore, respectively, the cumulative
79

disbursements stood at Rs.38,934 crore (as on July 31, 2007).
The disbursements under various tranches of RIDF during
2007-08 (up to July 31) amounted to Rs.1,374 crore. During
2006-07, various State Governments were sanctioned loans
aggregating Rs.10,555 crore, including Rs.1,023 crore sanctioned
to the distressed districts of four States viz., Andhra Pradesh,
Kerala, Karnataka and Maharashtra.
(b) Priority Sector Lending:
Revised Guidelines
143. Guidelines on lending to the priority sector were revised
with effect from April 30, 2007 based on the Technical Paper of
the Internal Working Group (Chairman: Shri C. S. Murthy) and
the feedback received thereon from the Government of India,
banks, financial institutions, NBFCs, associations of industries,
media, public and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA). The
revised guidelines focus on ensuring adequate flow of bank
credit to weaker segments of the population and to employmentintensive sectors of the economy. The broad categories that are
covered under the priority sector include agriculture, small
enterprises, retail trade, micro credit, education and housing,
subject to certain limits. The revised guidelines also take into
account the revised definition of small and micro enterprises
envisaged in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
Development Act, 2006.
(c) Simplification of the Procedures and Processes
for Agricultural Loans
144. The Working Group (Chairman: Shri C.P. Swarnkar)
constituted by the Reserve Bank to examine the
80

documentation, procedures and other requirements
prescribed by banks in providing agricultural loans, submitted
its report in April 2007 which was placed on the Reserve
Bank’s website. On the basis of its recommendations, all
SCBs (including RRBs) were advised to dispense with the
requirement of submitting ‘Nil Dues’ Certificate (NDC) for
small loans up to Rs.50,000 to small and marginal farmers,
share-croppers and the like and, instead, obtain
self-declaration from the borrower. Furthermore, in order to
overcome the problem of producing identification/status
documents, banks were advised to accept certificates
provided by local administration/panchayati raj institutions
regarding the cultivation of crops in case of loans to landless
labourers, share-croppers and oral lessees.
(d) Agricultural Indebtedness: Constitution
of Internal Working Group
145. The Committee on Agricultural Indebtedness
(Chairman: Dr. R. Radhakrishna) constituted by the
Government of India has submitted its report, which,
inter alia, addresses issues relating to creation of credit
absorption capacities, need for risk mitigation practices,
introduction of cyclical credit system, dispute resolution
mechanisms and setting up of a debt redemption fund. It is
proposed to constitute an Internal Working Group to examine
the Committee’s recommendations that are relevant to the
banking system in general and the Reserve Bank, in
particular. The Group is expected to have consultations with
stakeholders and submit its report before December 31, 2007.
The Working Group’s report will be placed in the public
domain for feedback and further processing.
81

(e) Revival of Rural Co-operative
Credit Structure: Status
146. Based on the recommendations of the Task Force on
Revival of Rural Co-operative Credit Institutions (Chairman: Prof.
A. Vaidyanathan) and in consultation with State Governments,
the Government of India had approved a package for revival of
the short-term rural cooperative credit structure. Thirteen States
have executed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with the
Government of India and the NABARD as envisaged under the
package. Implementation and monitoring of the revival package
are being overseen by the National Implementing and Monitoring
Committee (NIMC) set up by the Government of India.
Furthermore, a study on the long-term cooperative credit structure
was entrusted to the Task Force by the Government of India
which submitted its report in August 2006. The Government is in
the process of formulating a package of measures in consultation
with State Governments.
(f)

Regional Rural Banks:
Status and Further Action

147. The Government of India initiated the process of Statelevel sponsor bank-wise amalgamation of RRBs in September
2005 in order to strengthen them. Consequent upon
amalgamation of 147 RRBs into 46 new RRBs sponsored by
18 banks in 17 States, the total number of RRBs was reduced
from 196 to 95.
148. In order to prepare RRBs to adopt appropriate technology
and migrate to core banking solutions for better customer
services, it is proposed:
82

•

to constitute a Working Group with representatives
from the Reserve Bank, the NABARD, sponsor banks
and RRBs for preparing a road-map for migration to
core banking solutions by RRBs.

149. The Internal Working Group on RRBs (Chairman: Shri A.
V. Sardesai) had recommended that RRBs may be advised to
maintain a minimum level of capital to risk-weighted assets ratio
(CRAR) which would be progressively raised to the current level
of CRAR as per the Basel I norms. At present, capital adequacy
norms are not prescribed for RRBs and state/central cooperative
banks. In order to further strengthen the capital structure of
RRBs and state/central cooperative banks as also in the context
of financial stability of the whole system, it is proposed that:
•

RRBs and state/central cooperative banks should
disclose the level of CRAR as on March 31, 2008 in
their balance sheets.

•

a road-map may be evolved for achieving the desired
level of CRAR by these banks.

(g) Relief Measures for Distressed Farmers
150. The Working Group (Chairman: Prof.S.S.Johl) constituted
by the Reserve Bank to suggest measures for assisting distressed
farmers, including provision of financial counselling services and
introduction of a specific Credit Guarantee Scheme under the
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guaranee Corporation (DICGC)
Act for such farmers, submitted its final report in November
2006. Based on the recommendations of the Working Group, an
Agricultural Loans (Distressed Farmers) Guarantee Scheme,
2007 has been drafted and forwarded to the Government of
83

India. The Scheme is being revised based on the Government’s
comments.
(h) Technical Group for Review of Legislations
on Money Lending
151. The Technical Group (Chairman: Shri S.C. Gupta) set up
to review the efficacy of the existing legislative framework
governing money lending and its enforcement machinery in
different States and make recommendations to State
Governments for improving the legal and enforcement framework
in the interest of rural households, submitted its report in July
2007. The report has been forwarded to State Governments for
consideration.
(i)

Credit Flow to Micro, Small and
Medium Enterprises Sector

152. Consequent upon announcement made in the Annual
Policy Statement of April 2007, all State Level Bankers’ Committee
(SLBC) convenor banks were advised on May 8, 2007 to review
their institutional arrangements for delivering credit to the small
and medium enterprises (SME) sector, especially in 388 clusters
identified by the United Nations Industrial Development
Organisation (UNIDO) spread over 21 states in various parts of
the country.
(j)

Promotion of Livelihood in the Unorganised
Sector: Role of Financial System

153. The National Commission for Enterprises in the
Unorganised Sector, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Arjun
K.Sengupta has submitted to the Central Government a
84

comprehensive report on ‘Conditions of Work and Promotion of
Livelihood in the Unorganised Sector’. The report has suggested
a package of measures for addressing some critical issues
relating to farm and non-farm sectors. Some of the
recommendations contained in the report relate to the Indian
financial system. In order to study these recommendations and
suggest the way forward, it is proposed:
•

to constitute a Working Group to study the various
recommendations of the report of the Sengupta
Committee which are relevant to the financial system
and to suggest an appropriate action plan for
implementation of acceptable recommendations. The
Group would submit its report within a month.

(k) Rehabilitation/Nursing of Potentially Viable
Sick SME Units
154. The Standing Advisory Committee on Flow of Institutional
Credit to the SME Sector observed in its eighth meeting held on
January 16, 2007 that there has been considerable delay in
rehabilitation/nursing of the potentially viable sick SME units
due to the inability of promoters to bring in additional contribution
for rehabilitation/nursing of the units. As suggested in the meeting,
a Working Group has been constituted (Chairman: Dr.K.C.
Chakrabarty) with representatives from banks and the Small
Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to examine the
feasibility of bringing in additional capital through alternative
routes such as equity participation and venture financing and
suggest remedial measures for those potentially viable sick units
which can be rehabilitated at the earliest. The Group is expected
to submit its report by December 2007.
85

(l)

Financial Inclusion

(i)

Pilot Project for SLBCs for 100 per cent Financial
Inclusion: Status and Further Action

155. So far, 160 districts have been identified for financial
inclusion and 100 per cent financial inclusion has been achieved
in the Union Territory of Puducherry and in 28 districts in eight
States (Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh,
Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab and West Bengal). Notably, all districts
of Himachal Pradesh have achieved financial inclusion. An
evaluation of the progress made in achieving financial inclusion
in these districts is being undertaken to draw lessons for further
action in this regard.
(ii) Working Group on Improvement of Banking Services
in Lakshadweep: Status
156. A Working Group (Chairman: Regional Director for Kerala
and the Union Territory of Lakshadweep) with members from
the Government of the Union Territory, the zonal heads of the
NABARD, the SIDBI and the SLBC convenor bank has been
constituted to undertake a study of banking services provided in
the Union Territory of Lakshadweep. The Group is currently
examining the various issues relating to improvement in banking
services in the Union Territory.
(iii) Working Group on Improvement of Banking Services
in Himachal Pradesh
157. A Working Group (Chairman: Regional Director for Punjab
and Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh)
has been constituted to review the role of banks and financial
institutions in supporting initiatives taken by the State Government
86

of Himachal Pradesh for promoting economic development and
recommending measures for enhancing greater outreach/
penetration of the banking system in the State. The Group has
representatives from the State Government of Himachal Pradesh,
the NABARD, the SIDBI and the SLBC convenor bank. The
Group submitted its report in September 2007 which is under
examination.
(iv) Working Group on Improvement of Banking Services
in Jharkhand
158. With a view to improving banking facilities in certain less
developed States/regions, the Reserve Bank had earlier
constituted State-specific working groups to suggest necessary
developmental initiatives. In pursuance of this policy, a working
group for the State of Jharkhand has since been constituted to
recommend measures to enhance the outreach of banking
services in the State.
(v) Services to Depositors and Small Borrowers in Rural
and Semi-Urban Areas: Status
159. As indicated in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2005,
the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER)
was entrusted to carry out a study on the quality of services
rendered by branches of commercial banks to their customers
(both depositors and small borrowers) in the rural and
semi-urban areas. The NCAER has since submitted its report
which is being placed in the public domain.
(vi) Lead Bank Scheme
160. The Lead Bank Scheme, introduced in 1969, aimed at
coordinating the activities of banks and other development
87

agencies for achieving the overall objectives of enhancing the
flow of bank finance to the priority sector and promoting banks’
role in overall development of the rural sector. With a focus on
financial inclusion and recent developments in the banking sector,
and in order to improve the Scheme’s effectiveness, it is
proposed:
•

to constitute a High Level Committee to review
the Lead Bank Scheme.

(vii) Credit Counselling: Setting up of Financial
Literacy-cum-Counselling Centres
161. In the light of the recommendations of the Working Group
(Chairman: Prof. S. S. Johl) constituted for suggesting measures
for assisting distressed farmers as also the Working Group
(Chairman: Shri C. P. Swarnkar) constituted to examine
procedures and processes for agricultural loans, SLBC convenor
banks were advised to set up a financial literacy-cum-counselling
centre in any one district on a pilot basis and extend it to all
other districts in due course, based on the experience gained.
Several banks have since taken initiatives in opening credit
counselling centres in the country. In order to take this initiative
forward it is proposed:
•

to prepare a concept paper on the subject detailing
the future course of action and place it on the Reserve
Bank’s website for feedback.

(viii) Information and Communication Technology
to Enhance Financial Inclusion
162. Widespread use of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) is expected to make 100 per cent financial
88

inclusion a feasible goal in terms of convenience, delivery, cost
effectiveness, reliability and security for costumers as well as
providers of financial services. The initial cost in rolling out such
technology-based services could hinder the path of financial
inclusion. Furthermore, in certain remote areas, the unavailability
of electricity supply may also require investment in solar power
generating devices for use of ICT. It is, therefore, proposed:
•

to provide financial assistance to RRBs for defraying
a part of their initial cost in implementing ICT-based
solutions, including installation of solar power
generating devices for powering ICT equipment in
remote and under-served areas.

(m) Micro-finance
163. The self help group (SHG)-Bank Linkage Programme has
emerged as the major micro-finance programme in the country
and is being implemented by commercial banks, RRBs and
co-operative banks. By 2006-07, 29,24,973 SHGs were
credit-linked to banks, with cumulative bank loans of
Rs.18,047 crore.
(n) Customer Service in the Reserve Bank
164. It has been the endeavour of the Reserve Bank to improve
the quality of its public services to the common person and
reduce transaction costs as well as time, both for the Reserve
Bank and the citizens/organisations. A Committee on Procedures
and Performance Audit on Public Services (CPPAPS) (Chairman:
Shri S.S. Tarapore) was set up in 2003 to undertake procedures
and performance audit on public services and regulatory
clearances in the Reserve Bank and to coordinate with the
89

Committees on Customer Services set up by banks. It has now
been proposed to constitute a Committee (Chairman: Shri
Prabhakar Rao) to evaluate customer services rendered by the
Reserve Bank. The Committee would evaluate the efforts for
improving public services to common persons undertaken by
the Reserve Bank since the adoption of the recommendations
of the CPPAPS, review the existing policies and procedures and
suggest improvement in the quality of services.
III. Prudential Measures
165. The Reserve Bank has been adapting regulatory and
supervisory tools to facilitate appropriate evolution of the financial
system. The endeavour has been to anchor public confidence,
to engage in financial development to support accelerated
economic growth and to adopt international best practices with
regard to prudential regulations, disclosure standards and
supervisory processes.
(a) Discussion Paper on Holding Companies
in Banking Groups
166. In many countries, deregulation and financial consolidation
has led to the development of financial holding companies
(commercial banking, insurance, investment banking and other
financial activities are conducted under the same corporate
umbrella). Different financial services within the same organisation
are purveyed using different conglomerate models, viz., the
universal bank, the bank subsidiary and the bank holding
company. These conglomerate models can have one or more
layers of intermediate holding companies. Accordingly, a
discussion paper on holding companies in banking groups has
90

been placed on the Reserve Bank’s website for feedback.
Guidelines in this regard would be issued by end-November
2007.
(b) Guidelines on Asset-Liability Management
System: Amendments
167. The Reserve Bank had issued guidelines on the AssetLiability Management (ALM) system in February 1999, which
covered, inter alia, interest rate risk and liquidity risk
measurement/reporting framework and prudential limits. Having
regard to the international practices, the level of sophistication
of banks in India and the need for a sharper assessment of the
efficacy of liquidity management, these guidelines have been
reviewed and amended with reference to the approach to the
measurement of liquidity risk, mismatches and the structural
liquidity as also the frequency of supervisory reporting.
Operational guidelines in this regard have since been issued.
(c) Introduction of Credit Default Swaps
168. The recent amendments to the Reserve Bank of India
Act, 1934 has provided legality of OTC derivative instruments,
including credit derivatives, and accordingly the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2007 proposed to permit banks and PDs to
begin transacting in single-entity credit default swaps (CDS).
The draft guidelines on CDS were placed on the Reserve
Bank’s website for wider dissemination and comments. On
the basis of the feedback, revised draft guidelines have been
placed on the Reserve Bank’s website for a second round of
consultation and final guidelines would be issued by
end-November 2007.
91

(d) Bank Finance to Factoring Companies:
Review of Existing Guidelines
169. In view of difficulties expressed by some banks, a Working
Group has been constituted with representatives from banks,
factoring companies and the Reserve Bank to review the existing
guidelines regarding financing of factoring companies. The Group
would submit its report by November 15, 2007.
(e) Differentiated Bank Licences
170. The Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 proposed to
prepare a technical paper on differentiated bank licences with a
view to directing the resources of banks to their niche areas and
to sustain efficiency in the banking system which can be equally
applicable to both domestic and foreign banks. The technical
paper has been placed on the Reserve Bank’s website on
October 19, 2007.
171. The paper examined the statutory background of
licensing of banks, the existing policies of licensing of private
sector banks and foreign banks, international experiences and
practices, and pros and cons of the introduction of a
differentiated bank licensing regime. The paper recommended
that in order to enable the banking system to operate at optimum
efficiency and in the interest of financial inclusion, it would be
necessary for all banks to offer certain minimum services to all
customers, while allowing sufficient freedom to function
according to their own business models. The paper also
recommended continuation of the existing system for the time
being.
92

(f)

Recovery Agents Engaged by Banks

172. In view of the rise in the number of litigations against
banks for engaging recovery agents in the recent past, it is felt
that the adverse publicity could result in serious reputational risk
for the banking sector as a whole. An urgent need has, therefore,
arisen to review the policy, practice, procedure involved in the
engagement of recovery agents by banks in India. Accordingly,
banks are urged to follow prescribed specific considerations while
engaging recovery agents.
173. Complaints received by the Reserve Bank regarding
abusive practices followed by a bank’s recovery agents would
invite serious supervisory disapproval. The Reserve Bank would
consider imposing a temporary ban (or even a permanent ban
in case of persistent abusive practices) for engaging recovery
agents on those banks where strictures have been passed/
penalties have been imposed by a High Court/Supreme Court
or against its Directors/Officers with regard to the abusive
practices followed by their recovery agents. An operational circular
in this regard would be issued by November 15, 2007.
(g) Cross-border Supervision
174. Cross-border supervision has assumed importance in view
of rapid integration of financial markets as also the heightened
pace of merger and acquisition activities worldwide. In this
context, the present system of informal exchange of information
and supervisory cooperation amongst regulators need to be
enhanced and well structured, particularly for internationally active
banks. Accordingly, it is proposed:
•

to constitute a working group to lay down the
road-map for adoption of a suitable framework for
93

cross-border supervision and supervisory cooperation
with overseas regulators, consistent with the
framework envisaged in the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (BCBS).
(h) Consolidated Supervision and Financial
Conglomerate Monitoring Mechanism:
Integration
175. Guidelines for consolidated accounting and other
quantitative methods to facilitate consolidated supervision were
issued to banks in February 2003, based on recommendations
of the report of a multi-disciplinary working group (Chairman:
Shri Vipin Malik). Consolidated supervision is undertaken through
consolidated financial statements (CFSs) which are intended for
public disclosure, consolidated prudential reports (CPRs) for
supervisory assessment of risks that could be transmitted to
banks by other group members, and compliance with prudential
norms on group basis.
176. The financial conglomerates (FC) monitoring framework
was put in place on the basis of the recommendations of the
report of the Inter-regulatory Working Group (Chairperson: Smt.
Shyamala Gopinath) on monitoring of Systemically Important
Financial Intermediaries (Financial Conglomerates). The focus
of the FC return is mainly on intra-group transactions and
exposures (both fund-based and non-fund based transactions).
The dominant/major entity in the group, called a ‘designated
entity’ (DE), collects and collates FC data/information and
forwards them to the principal regulator for analysis.
177. The evaluation of overall risks and possible transfer thereof
within the group structure, however, needs to be evolved under
94

the consolidated supervision process for bank-led conglomerates.
Accordingly, in order to enhance the effectiveness of the banking
supervisory system for bank-led conglomerates, it is proposed
to integrate the process of consolidated supervision with the
financial conglomerate monitoring mechanism. Draft guidelines
in this regard would be placed on the Reserve Bank’s website
by end-January 2008.
(i)

Monitoring Banks’ Exposure to Derivatives

178. At present, supervision of derivatives transactions by
banks is carried out through on-site inspection during the annual
financial inspection of banks and off-site monitoring of exposures
through specified returns. In view of the potential of derivatives
instruments to amplify systemic risks, there is a need to put in
place a comprehensive oversight structure targeting the credit
risk and operational risk in addition to the market risk, as at
present. Furthermore, supervisory oversight needs to include
stress testing of derivatives portfolios of banks for credit risk,
particularly in view of banks resorting to multi-lateral netting for
their counter party exposures. In view of majority of derivatives
being over the counter (OTC) products, it is proposed:
•

to cover, besides general market risk, specific risk,
especially the credit risk arising out of deficient
documentation or settlement risk, under the
supervisory process.

(j)

Implementation of Basel II - Pillar 2

179. The Reserve Bank issued final guidelines on
implementation of Basel II framework in regard to Pillar 1 and
Pillar 3 in April 2007. As regards Pillar 2, banks were advised to
95

put in place internal capital adequacy assessment process
(ICAAP) to capture all material risks, including those that are
partly covered or not covered under the other two Pillars, with
the approval of their boards. The ICAAP of banks are required
to be subject to a supervisory review evaluation process (SREP)
for which the structure and methodologies for identification and
quantification of various risks (not covered under Pillar 1) and
provision of additional capital or controls/management actions
are being worked out.
(k) Supervisory Review Process
180. The Mid-term Review of October 2005 had indicated the
initiation of a supervisory review process (SRP) for select banks
having significant exposure to some sectors, namely, real estate,
highly leveraged NBFCs, venture capital funds and capital
markets, in order to ensure that effective risk mitigants and
sound internal control systems are in place. In the first round of
SRP, a framework was developed for monitoring the systemically
important individual banks. The second round of SRP analysed
the exposure to sensitive sectors, in particular, to the real estate
and capital market sectors of select banks. Ten banks were
identified as outliers based on the real estate and capital market
exposures in excess of 200 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively,
of their net worth. The initial analysis revealed that prima facie,
all banks under review had put in place risk management policies
and systems and controls to manage risks arising from exposures
to sensitive sectors. In case of exposures to real estate, certain
irregularities were observed with regard to the implementation
of banks’ own approved policies. Accordingly, banks were advised
to improve risk management processes at operating levels.
Furthermore, banks were provided with an indicative list of
96

deficiencies and irregularities and were advised to explicitly spell
out the required norms for lending to the real estate sector in
their policies.
IV. Institutional Developments
Payment and Settlement Systems
181. The Reserve Bank continued to strengthen the framework
for payment and settlement systems by utilising the full potential
of information technology (IT) to improve operational efficiency.
The main focus has been on ensuring business continuity, prompt
customer service and development of electronic payment
products.
(a) Adequacy of Business Continuity Plans
182. The Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 emphasised
adequate business continuity plans by banks as part of disaster
recovery management, with a view to ensuring continuous and
prompt customer services. With increasing reliance on the use
of IT-based processing of day-to-day operations for extending
banking and financial services, ensuring appropriate business
continuity plans assumes critical importance. The Reserve Bank
conducts regular and periodic drills in respect of critical
inter-bank systems in order to facilitate banking services and
ensure continuity. The level of preparedness by the
participating banks in these exercises conducted by the
Reserve Bank is, however, inadequate. Banks are urged to
ensure that adequate disaster recovery systems are put in
place so as to fully comply with the requirements of the next
drill of the Reserve Bank.
97

(b) Implementation of Core Banking Systems
183. Implementation of core banking systems (CBS) for banking
operations has increased and banks have been encouraged to
install the CBS in a phased manner. In view of the advantages
of these systems in promoting better costumer services, banks
are urged to draw up time-bound action plans for implementation
of CBS across all their branches.
(c) Electronic Payment Products:
Status and Proposed Action
184. The coverage of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)
system has increased significantly. By October 23, 2007 RTGS
connectivity was available in more than 34,023 branches and
the Reserve Bank continues to improve the quality of services
through the RTGS.
185. The Committee (Chairman: Dr.R.B. Barman) constituted
for introduction of the National Settlement System (NSS)
examined various models and recommended the Centralised
Funds Transfer System (CFTS) model for implementation. Under
the CFTS model, banks would be able to transfer funds across
all Deposit Accounts Departments (DADs) on real time basis.
The CFTS interface would enable the member banks to transfer
funds from surplus centre for meeting the clearing obligations
smoothly. So far, 11 DADs - Mumbai, Chennai, New Delhi,
Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Nagpur, Ahmedabad,
Chandigarh, Kanpur and Jaipur - have been connected to the
CFTS. The remaining five centres would be connected after the
system stabilises in these 11 centres.
186.

The Electronic Clearing Service (ECS), which facilitates
98

bulk payments, is currently available at 67 centres. The Reserve
Bank proposes to operationalise the National Electronic Clearing
Service (NECS) using the existing infrastructure of National
Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system with a view to widening
the geographical coverage of the ECS. Under the NECS, the
clearing and settlement would be centralised at Mumbai. Banks
would receive their ECS centrally and transfer the transactions
either on their core banking solution or arrange to distribute to
their branches. Banks having their branches under the core
banking solution can derive maximum benefits out of this system.
It is proposed to draw up an action plan for its implementation in
consultation with banks.
(d) Eligibility Criteria for Access to
Payment Systems
187. An Internal Working Group, constituted to prepare
comprehensive draft guidelines on minimum eligibility criteria for
direct members of the clearing houses, submitted its report in
September 2007 which has been placed on the Reserve Bank’s
website for public comments. The Group has recommended a
set of financial parameters as criteria for clearing house
membership and has also suggested for periodical review of
compliance by members with a view to ensuring continued safety
and soundness of the system.
(e) Annual Review of Payment and
Settlement Systems
188. The Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 proposed an
annual review of payment and settlement systems and
accordingly, its first review was undertaken for the year ended
99

March 31, 2007. The comments/views of banks, chambers of
commerce and industry/trade bodies were obtained on the review
and a policy paper would be placed on the Reserve Bank’s
website by November 15, 2007.
Urban Co-operative Banks
Information Technology Support to UCBs
189. Considerable progress has been made in the area of
human resources development for facilitating the growth of the
UCB sector, pursuant to the Reserve Bank entering into MoUs
with State Governments and the Government of India. During
2006-08, 69 programmes have been held in which 675 Directors,
515 Executives, 163 Auditors have participated with a view to
professionalising the management of UCBs. In furtherance of
commitments under the MoUs and with a view to identifying the
areas requiring IT support for UCBs, it is proposed:
•

to constitute a working group comprising
representatives of the Reserve Bank, State
Governments and the UCB sector to examine the
various areas where IT support could be provided by
the Reserve Bank.

Committee on Financial Sector Assessment
190. The Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 outlined the
approach and progress made by the Committee on Financial
Sector Assessment (CFSA) (Chairman: Dr.Rakesh Mohan;
Co-Chairman: Dr.D.Subbarao) to undertake a self-assessment
of the Indian financial sector. As envisaged, the CFSA has
constituted four Advisory Panels for the assessment of Financial
100

Stability and Stress Testing, Financial Regulation and Supervision,
Institutions and Market Structure and Transparency Standards.
The Advisory Panels would prepare separate reports covering
each of the above aspects. These Advisory Panels comprise of
non-official experts with domain knowledge in respective areas
and officials with similar expertise represented as Special Invitees.
191. The Advisory Panel on Financial Stability and Stress
Testing (Chairman: Shri M.B.N. Rao) would conduct macroprudential surveillance (including system-level stress testing) to
assess the soundness and stability of financial system and
suggest measures for strengthening the financial structure and
system and its development in a medium-term perspective. The
other three Advisory Panels would identify and consider the
relevant standards and codes as currently prescribed and
applicable to different areas, evaluate their implementation in
the Indian context, identify gaps in adherence to respective
standards and suggest possible roadmaps towards compliance
in a medium-term perspective. The Advisory Panel on Financial
Regulation and Supervision (Chairman: Shri M.S. Verma) would
consider the relevant standards and codes applicable for financial
regulation and supervision pertaining to the banking sector,
financial markets and insurance; the Advisory Panel on Institutions
and Market Structure (Chairman: Shri C.M. Vasudev) would
consider the relevant standards and codes applicable to
bankruptcy laws, accounting and auditing, payment and
settlement systems and corporate governance policies; and the
Advisory Panel on Transparency Standards (Chairman: Shri Nitin
Desai) would consider the relevant standards and codes
applicable for transparency in monetary, financial, fiscal and data
dissemination policies.
101

192. The CFSA, before setting up of the Advisory Panels, had
set up Technical Groups comprising of officials representing
mainly regulatory agencies and the Government in all the
above-mentioned subject areas which have progressed with
technical work in their respective areas. These Groups also
provide the Advisory Panels with technical notes and background
material as necessary.
193. The CFSA submitted an interim report delineating its
approach and reviewing the progress of work to the Finance
Minister and Governor, Reserve Bank of India in July 2007. As
mentioned in the Annual Policy Statement, the CFSA would
publish Advisory Panel reports and also its own Synthesis Report.
Based on an objective analysis of the present strengths and
weaknesses of the financial sector and the status with regard to
standards, the CFSA is also expected to lay out a road-map for
further reforms in a medium-term perspective. The CFSA is
expected to complete the assessment by March 2008.
