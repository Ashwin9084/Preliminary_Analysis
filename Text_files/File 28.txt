Reserve Bank of India
Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2008-09
Statement by
Dr. D. Subbarao
Governor
This quarterly review is set in the context of a deteriorating global
economic outlook and heightened uncertainty about the global financial sector. In
fact, there has been a rapid and marked downturn in the global economic outlook
since the Reserve Bank’s Mid-term Review in October 2008. The continued bad
news from large international financial institutions on a regular basis renews
concerns as to when the global financial sector might attain a semblance of
stability.
2.

The initial hope that the crisis could be contained in the financial sector

has been belied. With all the advanced economies – the US, Europe and Japan
– firmly in recession, the crisis has fully transmitted from the financial sector to
the real economy. The loss of confidence in the global financial markets has set
off a chain of deleveraging, declining asset values, falling income, contracting
demand and rising unemployment. Governments and central banks around the
world are responding to the crisis with bold and unconventional initiatives. Even
so, there is a contentious debate on whether these measures are adequate and
appropriate, and when, if at all, they will begin to have an impact. There is also
considerable uncertainty about when we might see the bottom of the asset and
business cycle. There is emerging consensus though that there may be no
recovery till late 2009; indeed, some analysts believe that recovery may be
delayed beyond 2009. Contrary to the expectation of decoupling, which was a
commonly held view even till recently, the crisis has spread to the emerging
economies too through all the channels – the financial channel, the real channel,
and importantly as happens in all financial crises, through the confidence
channel.
3.

The Indian economy experienced a cyclical moderation in growth

accompanied by high inflation in the first half of 2008-09. There is now distinct
evidence of further slowdown as a consequence of the global downturn. The

knock-on effects of the global financial crisis, economic slowdown, and falling
commodity prices are affecting the Indian economy in several ways. Capital flow
reversals intensified in September and October 2008 though they have stabilised
since then; international credit channels continue to be constrained; capital
market valuations remain low; industrial production growth has slackened; export
growth has turned negative during October-November 2008; and overall
business sentiment has deteriorated. On the positive side, the headline inflation
has decelerated, though consumer price inflation is yet to show moderation; and
the domestic financial markets are functioning in an orderly manner. Although
bank credit growth has been higher than in the previous year, rough calculation
shows that flow of overall financial resources to the commercial sector in the
current financial year has declined marginally as compared with the previous
year. This was on account of decline in other sources of funding such as
resource mobilisation from the capital market and external commercial
borrowings (ECBs).
4.

To manage the impact of the crisis, since mid-September 2008, the

Reserve Bank has taken a number of monetary easing and liquidity enhancing
measures. The Government has also launched two fiscal stimulus packages to
boost aggregate demand. Against this background, this Statement provides an
assessment of Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments (Section I), followed
by the Stance of Monetary Policy (Section II), and Monetary Measures (Section
III). Yesterday, the Reserve Bank issued an analytical review of macroeconomic
and monetary developments providing information and technical analyses in
greater detail. This Statement should be read and understood in conjunction with
the yesterday’s review.

I. Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments
Global Outlook
5.

The global economic environment continues to be uncertain. The world

economy, which was passing through unprecedented financial turmoil since
August 2007, experienced a jolt in September 2008 when the failure of Lehman
Brothers led to widespread panic across global financial markets. The liquidity
crisis that ensued not only engulfed developed markets but also quickly

transmitted to emerging markets, including India. The US Federal Reserve
responded by infusing dollar liquidity into large financial centres through currency
swap arrangements with major foreign central banks in addition to massive
injection of liquidity in the domestic market through several innovative schemes.
6.

Many systemically important commercial banks, investment banks,

insurance companies and other financial institutions in the US and Europe have
suffered large losses that undermined their capital bases. The credit spreads for
corporate paper went up sharply. The US Federal Reserve and other central
banks/governments have rescued financial institutions through large bailout
packages, but financial markets continue to suffer from a crisis of confidence.
The unfolding developments have broader ramifications for both growth and
stability in an integrated world where cross-exposures, particularly among
banks/financial institutions, and trade links are inextricably large and complex.
There is yet no sign of any early resolution as damage to collaterals continues
unabated with house prices tumbling in the US and also in parts of Europe.
7.

According to the November 2008 update of the World Economic Outlook

(WEO) issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global real GDP growth,
on a purchasing power parity basis, is projected to decelerate from 3.7 per cent
in 2008 to 2.2 per cent in 2009. In market exchange rate terms, the projected
deceleration is even sharper from 2.6 per cent in 2008 to 1.1 per cent in 2009.
Furthermore, the IMF has cautioned that the downside risks to these global
growth projections have further intensified.
8.

The US, the UK, the Euro area and Japan, which together accounted for

nearly half of world GDP in 2007, are officially in recession. All evidence
suggests that contractionary forces are strong: demand has slumped, consumer
confidence is at a historic low, production has declined, job losses are on the rise
and asset prices continue to fall. Reflecting the slowdown of international
demand, crude oil prices declined sharply in the last quarter of 2008. Prices of
many other key commodities such as metals, cement, cotton and wheat too have
dropped

sharply.

Consequently,

consumer

price

inflation

has

declined

significantly in many countries including the US, the Euro area, Japan and the
UK. The international financial system continues to remain dysfunctional amidst
extreme risk aversion, freezing of money and credit markets, and disruption of
international capital flows. In response, central banks in advanced countries have

reduced their policy interest rates to historically low levels. The major global
concern now is to forestall the worst ever recession since the 1930s. While
monetary ammunition has been nearly exhausted in many countries, at least in
terms of setting nominal interest rates, measures such as quantitative easing,
credit easing and fiscal stimulus are on the policy agenda.
Emerging Market Economies
9.

The emerging market economies (EMEs), which showed considerable

resilience in weathering the crisis up to September 2008 on the strength of
domestic demand supported by sustained export growth, came under strain in
the last quarter of 2008 through contagion from trade and financial channels. The
slowdown of world trade was deeper than anticipated causing reduction in
aggregate demand in the EMEs. In a sign of flight to safety, capital flows from
developed countries to the EMEs declined sharply in 2008. Reflecting lower flows
through both current and capital accounts, currencies of the EMEs depreciated
against the US dollar. EME equity markets suffered large losses in the wake of
reversal of portfolio flows. Bank lending to the EMEs declined and credit spreads
increased sharply due to the prevailing credit crunch in advanced economies.
EME exports declined because of tighter trade credit coming on top of slumping
export demand. Going forward, exports to advanced economies are expected to
decline further posing a major risk to growth in the EMEs.
10.

In evaluating the current and potential problems arising from the crisis, it is

important to note some broad differences between the advanced economies of
Europe and North America and the EMEs. The crisis originated in the financial
sector in the US, which led to the near collapse of their largest financial
institutions and banks. Because of linkages across the financial system, the crisis
spread almost immediately to Europe with European banks reporting very large
losses. Both the US and European governments responded through large scale
infusion of funds into the banking systems. Furthermore, with the erosion of
banks’ balance sheets, mistrust among banks intensified, as a result of which
money markets dried up, and inter-bank markets choked. This engendered a
credit squeeze which transmitted to the real economy. The first line of defence in
fighting the crisis was aggressive monetary policy action, including rate cuts
followed by quantitative monetary and credit easing. These measures were also

accompanied by a significant expansion of central banks’ direct participation in
money markets in several ways.
11.

The situation in the EMEs has been quite different. By and large, their

financial institutions have not exhibited fragility, inter-bank confidence has been
relatively normal and inter-bank money markets have continued to function.
Nevertheless, the crisis has affected the EMEs in mainly three ways. The first
was the exit of foreign equity which resulted in decline in stock markets, capital
flow reversals and pressures on the exchange rate. The second source of impact
was the drying up of overseas lines of credit for banks and corporates which
shifted demand to the domestic credit market. The third source of impact is the
significant deceleration in global trade growth reducing the demand for EME
exports. Monetary policy actions by the EMEs have, therefore, been more in
response to emerging real economy problems rather than financial sector
problems. It is important to keep this distinction in view in designing and
evaluating responses to the crisis.
Domestic Outlook
12.

Like other EMEs, India too has been affected by the global financial crisis.

Real GDP growth moderated to 7.8 per cent in the first half of 2008-09 as against
9.3 per cent in the first half of 2007-08 (Table 1). The third quarter of 2008-09
witnessed signs of further moderation in growth, especially in the industrial sector
and some segments of the services sector.
Agriculture and Industry
13.

Good sowing and favourable weather conditions suggest that agricultural

production during 2008-09 may be close to or better than last year’s record
production. During April-November 2008, the index of industrial production (IIP)
growth decelerated to 3.9 per cent from 9.2 per cent a year ago. Episodes of
large inventory build-up, production cuts and temporary closure in some sectors
such as automobiles at the beginning of the second half of 2008-09 indicate a
period of stress on account of lack of demand.
Corporate Performance
14.

During the first two quarters of 2008-09, despite high top-line growth,

operating margins of the private corporate sector were eroded by higher input

costs and significant drop in ‘other’ income. In light of the subsequent slowdown,
industrial investment plans are slowing down, although ongoing investment
projects appear to be continuing. The erosion in pricing power of corporates was
reflected in rising inventories as a proportion to sales. While the downside risk to
corporate profitability has increased, this may at least be partly offset by falling
input prices and a gradual reduction in borrowing costs.

Business Confidence
15.

The Reserve Bank’s latest round of quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey

shows weak and deteriorating business sentiment among private manufacturing
companies for the last quarter of 2008-09. The survey indicates weak demand
conditions and decline in sentiment for production, order books, capacity
utilisation and exports. Corporates also reported a significant decline in
employment expectations for January-March 2009. This picture is consistent with
business confidence surveys conducted by other agencies.
Lead Indicators
16.

In terms of lead indicators, service sector activity appears to be

moderating in several sub-sectors, barring communications and freight
movement. On the positive side, sustained performance of the agricultural sector,
fiscal stimulus, falling global crude oil prices and softening of domestic input
prices such as energy, cement and steel would have a positive impact on
industrial production in the coming months.

Inflation
17.

Headline inflation, as measured by year-on-year variations in the

wholesale price index (WPI), fell by more than half from its intra-year peak of
12.91 per cent on August 2, 2008 to 5.60 per cent by January 10, 2009. While
prices of primary articles and manufactured products increased, fuel prices
declined (Table 2). In terms of relative contribution to decelerating headline
inflation between August 2, 2008 and January 10, 2009, petroleum and basic
metals (combined weight of 13.2 per cent in WPI) together accounted for 79.4
per cent, followed by ‘oilseeds, edible oils & oil cakes’ (16.4 per cent). Clearly,
the fall in commodity prices reflecting global trends has been the key driver of the
sharp fall in WPI inflation although effective management of domestic demand
too has contributed to this moderation.

18.

On the other hand, inflation based on various consumer price indices

(CPIs) is still in double digits due to the firm trend in prices of food articles and
the higher weight of food articles in measures of consumer price inflation (Table
2). As the decline in input prices percolates over time to the prices of
manufactured and other products, consumer price inflation too is expected to
soften in the months ahead. For its overall assessment of inflation outlook for
policy purposes, the Reserve Bank continues to monitor the full array of price
indicators.

Fiscal Scenario
19.

As a proportion of the budget estimates (BE), both tax and non-tax

revenue receipts of the Central Government for the period April-November 2008
were lower than those in the corresponding period of the previous year. On the
other hand, both revenue expenditure and total expenditure, as a proportion to
the BE, were higher than a year ago. Consequently, the revenue deficit and the
gross fiscal deficit (GFD) were significantly higher during April-November 2008
as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year (Table 3).

20.

For 2008-09, the Central Government had budgeted gross market

borrowing of Rs.1,78,575 crore and net market borrowing of Rs.99,000 crore.
Subsequently, the Government presented two supplementary demands, as a
result of which the market borrowing programme of the Central Government was
raised to Rs.2,52,154 crore (gross) and Rs.1,75,374 crore (net). Against this
enhanced borrowing programme, market borrowing of the Central Government

was Rs.2,22,154 crore (gross) and Rs.1,51,697 crore (net) during 2008-09 so far
(up to January 23, 2009). The weighted average yield and weighted average
maturity of central government dated securities issued during 2008-09 (up to
January 23, 2009) were at 8.03 per cent and 14.59 years respectively as
compared with 8.10 per cent and 14.38 years in 2007-08. The State
Governments have borrowed a net amount of Rs.46,327 crore up to January 23,
2009.
21. The evolving scenario raises some concerns on the extent of stress on the
fisc in the current year emanating from several factors. First, the Centre is
expected to suffer revenue losses from lower direct tax collection on account of
the economic slowdown. Second, the Centre is likely to lose further revenues
worth about 0.6 per cent of GDP due to cuts in excise and customs duties. Third,
there has been a disproportionate growth in expenditure of the Central
Government during April-November 2008, particularly in respect of revenue
expenditure arising out of increase in subsidies, disbursements as well as
implementation of the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission and the
farm debt waiver scheme. The net cash outgo indicated in supplementary
demands for grants would be of the order of 2.8 per cent of GDP (Rs.1,50,310
crore). Thus, additional expenditure coupled with foregone revenue would raise
the fiscal deficit from the budget estimate of 2.5 per cent to at least 5.9 per cent
of GDP. In addition, special bonds for Rs.44,000 crore and Rs.14,000 crore,
amounting to 1.1 per cent of GDP, have been issued to oil marketing companies
and fertiliser companies respectively during 2008-09 (up to January 23, 2009). In
its latest Review of the Economy (January 2009), the Economic Advisory Council
to the Prime Minister has placed the consolidated fiscal deficit of the Central
Government, including full issuances of oil and fertiliser bonds, at 8.0 per cent of
GDP for 2008-09.
22. The consolidated budgeted revenue surplus of the States in 2008-09 may
not, in fact, materialise. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit of the States
is expected to rise to 2.6 per cent of GDP. While some of the increase in the
revenue and fiscal deficits is on account of post-budget expenditure
commitments such as payment of arrears resulting from the Sixth Pay
Commission Award, a substantial increase is also due to the economic downturn
arising from the impact of the global financial crisis. Although the fiscal stimulus
packages have meant deviation from the roadmap laid out by the Fiscal

Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, reversing the consolidation
process of the last several years, they were warranted under the prevailing
circumstances. It is critically important, however, that the Centre and States reanchor to a revised FRBM mandate once the immediacy of the crisis is behind
us.
Monetary Conditions
23. Growth in key monetary aggregates – reserve money and money supply
(M3) – in 2008-09 so far has reflected the changing liquidity positions arising from
domestic and global financial conditions and the monetary policy response to the
evolving macroeconomic developments. Reserve money variations during 200809 have largely reflected increase in currency in circulation and reduction in the
cash reserve ratio (CRR) of banks.
24. Reduction in the CRR has three inter-related effects on reserve money.
First, it reduces reserve money as bankers’ required cash deposits with the
Reserve Bank fall. Second, the money multiplier rises. Third, with the increase in
the money multiplier, M3 expands with a lag. While the initial expansionary effect
is strong, the full effect is felt in 4-6 months. Reflecting these changes, while the
year-on-year increase in reserve money as on January 2, 2009 was lower, it was
significantly higher when adjusted for the first round effect of CRR reduction. The
annual M3 growth as on January 2, 2009 though lower compared with last year,
was higher than the trajectory projected in the Annual Policy Statement (Table 4).

25. Since September 2008, monetary conditions have been evolving following
changes in monetary policy in response to global developments and also due to
slackening of domestic demand conditions. As the Reserve Bank had to provide
dollar liquidity, its net foreign exchange assets (NFEA) contracted. The Reserve
Bank sought to compensate the fall in NFEA by expanding its net domestic
assets (NDA) through: (i) buy-back of securities held under the market
stabilisation scheme (MSS); (ii) purchase of oil bonds; (iii) enlargement of the
refinance window; and (iv) repo operations under the liquidity adjustment facility
(LAF). Thus, a notable feature of monetary operations during the third quarter of
2008-09 was the substitution of foreign assets by domestic assets to keep the
overall liquidity conditions comfortable. Liquidity conditions have indeed improved
since mid-November 2008 as reflected in daily absorption under the LAF reverse
repo and moderation in market interest rates.
Credit Conditions
26. The year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in non-food bank credit at 23.9 per cent as
on January 2, 2009 was higher than that of 22.0 per cent as on January 4, 2008
(Table 5). Increase in total flow of resources from the banking sector to the
commercial sector (i.e., non-food bank credit together with investments in
shares/bonds/debentures and commercial papers issued by public sector/private
sector companies) was also higher at 23.4 per cent as compared with 21.7 per
cent a year ago. Despite the expansion in bank credit, there was a perception of
lack of credit availability. This could be attributed to reduced flow of funds from
non-bank sources, notably the capital market and external commercial
borrowings.

During 2008-09 so far, the total flow of resources to the commercial
sector from banks and other sources was marginally lower than in the
previous year reflecting contraction of funds from other sources (Table

28.

At a disaggregated level, the year-on-year increase in bank credit to

industry as of December 2008 was sharply higher than that in the previous year
reflecting the substitution effect of other sources of funding by bank credit (Table
7).

29. There has been a noticeable variation in credit expansion across bank
groups. Expansion of credit by public sector banks was much higher this year
than in the previous year, while credit expansion by foreign and private sector
banks was significantly lower. The relatively slower pace of credit expansion
by foreign and private sector banks has also added to the perception of
inadequate credit flow in the system. There has also been perceptible
deceleration in growth of deposits with private and foreign banks (Table 8).

Commercial banks’ holdings of SLR securities became more liquid on

account of two factors. First, banks were permitted to use SLR securities to the
tune of 1.5 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) under the LAF
to meet the funding requirements of mutual funds, non-banking finance
companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs). Second, the
reduction in SLR by one percentage point to 24.0 per cent of NDTL in November
2008 released funds for credit deployment. Commercial banks’ SLR holdings
declined from 27.8 per cent (28.4 per cent adjusted for LAF) of NDTL in March
2008 to 25.8 per cent (28.1 per cent adjusted for LAF) in mid-October 2008
reflecting the banks’ reliance on the repo facility under the LAF as liquidity
conditions tightened. Reversing this trend by early January 2009, banks’ SLR
holdings increased to 28.9 per cent of NDTL (27.1 per cent adjusted for LAF)

reflecting improved liquidity conditions and increased government market
borrowings.
31.

Bank deposit and lending rates, which had firmed up during the current

financial year up to October 2008, started easing from November 2008. Between
November 2008 and January 2009, all public sector banks, several private sector
banks and some foreign banks reduced their deposit and lending rates. The
magnitude of reduction by public sector banks was larger than that by foreign
and private sector banks (Table 9).

The interest rate response to monetary policy easing has been faster in

the money and bond markets as compared to the credit market because of
several structural factors. First, the administered interest rate structure on small
savings could potentially constrain the reduction in deposit rates below some
threshold. Second, a substantial portion of bank deposits is mobilised at fixed
interest rates with an asymmetric contractual relationship. During the upturn of
the interest rate cycle, depositors have the flexibility to prematurely terminate the
existing deposits and re-deposit the funds at higher interest rates. However, in
the downturn of the interest rate cycle, banks have to necessarily carry these
deposits at higher rates of interest till their maturity. Third, competition among
banks for wholesale deposits for meeting the higher credit demand in the
upswing leads to an increase in the cost of funds. Fourth, linkage of concessional
lending rates to banks’ BPLRs makes overall lending rates less flexible. Fifth,
persistence of the large market borrowing programme of the government
hardens interest rate expectations. Sixth, with increase in risk aversion, lending
rates tend to be high even during a period with falling credit demand. From the
real economy perspective, however, for monetary policy to have demand
inducing effects, lending rates will have to come down.
33.

Notwithstanding the various factors that impede monetary transmission,

market interest rates do respond to changes in policy interest rates. As such,
current deposit and lending rates have significant room for further reduction.
Interest rates in the money and bond markets have already declined perceptibly
since their peaks in October 2008 (Table 10). Major public sector banks have
also reduced their term deposit rates in the range of 50-150 basis points.
Benchmark prime lending rates (BPLRs) of major public sector banks have come
down by 150-175 basis points. Major private sector banks have reduced their
BPLRs by 50 basis points, while major foreign banks are yet to do so. As a result
of several measures initiated by the Reserve Bank since mid-September 2008,
banks’ cost of funds would come down. This should encourage banks to reduce
their lending rates in the coming months.
Financial Markets
34.

The overnight interest rates generally ruled above the ceiling of the LAF

rate corridor at the beginning of October 2008 when the domestic money and

foreign exchange markets came under pressure. The overnight interest rates
eased in mid-October 2008 in response to the successive monetary easing
measures by the Reserve Bank which alleviated the liquidity pressures. The
overnight interest rates have remained below the upper bound of the LAF
corridor since November 3, 2008. Interest rates on various other segments of the
money market and government securities market have also softened markedly
(Table 10).

The rupee had appreciated against major currencies in 2007-08 due to

large capital inflows. It depreciated during 2008-09 so far reflecting extraordinary
developments in international financial markets and portfolio outflows by foreign
institutional investors (FIIs). It has remained range-bound since November 2008
(Table 11).

36. Equity markets weakened sharply till end-October 2008 in tandem with
global stock markets, particularly Asian markets, reflecting further deterioration in
the global financial market sentiment, FII outflows, slowdown in industrial growth
and lower corporate profits. The BSE Sensex declined from an all-time high of
20873 on January 8, 2008 to a low of 8451 on November 20, 2008. The equity
market has since remained generally range-bound; the BSE Sensex was at 8674
on January 23, 2009.
37.

The outlook for the domestic financial markets will be determined largely

by the developments in global financial markets and domestic liquidity conditions.
The banking system has been in surplus liquidity mode since mid-November
2008. The pressure on the exchange rate of the rupee has eased due to
moderation in capital outflows. In addition, the decline in global commodity
prices, particularly crude oil, is expected to further ease the pressure on foreign
currency on account of oil imports.
External Sector
38.

India’s current account deficit (CAD) of the balance of payments (BoP)
widened in the first half of 2008-09 in comparison with the
corresponding period of the previous year due to a large trade deficit,
reflecting high oil prices even as private transfers and software export
earnings were sustained. As net capital flows declined sharply, the
overall balance of payments position turned marginally negative during
the first half of 2008-09 as against a large surplus in the corresponding
period of the previous year (Table 12). Import growth had moderated
during October-November 2008 reflecting the fall in international oil
prices and slowing domestic demand. During the same period, export
growth turned negative reflecting slowing global demand. Going
forward, it is expected that imports may slow down faster than exports.

39.

The reversal of capital flows has raised concerns about management of

the BoP, particularly with reference to outstanding external debt with residual
maturity of less than one year. These concerns are somewhat misplaced as the
following analysis will show.
40.

India’s external debt with residual maturity of less than one year as at end-

March 2008 was estimated at around US $ 85 billion (as per revised data), which
would mature during the financial year 2008-09. Sovereign debt and commercial
borrowings are most likely to be rolled over during 2008-09. Indeed, the BoP data
for the first half of the year (April-September 2008) indicate net positive
accretions beyond roll-over under both these heads. Current trends indicate that
under NRI deposits, not only will the maturing debt be rolled over but there will be
net accretions as a result of the upward adjustment in interest rate ceilings on
such deposits. Here again, available data up to December 2008 show net
accretions. That leaves trade credit of the order of US $ 43.2 billion to be repaid
during 2008-09. Of this, as much as US $ 28.1 billion has already been disbursed
during April-November 2008 leaving a balance of US $ 15.1 billion. There are
reports that large inflows are in the pipeline on account of commitments of
buyers’ credit by the importers and oil companies. Even conservatively projecting
that only a small portion of this balance would be rolled over, India’s external
payment situation remains stable.

41.

The overall approach to the management of India’s foreign exchange

reserves takes into account the changing composition of the balance of
payments and endeavours to reflect the ‘liquidity risks’ associated with different
types of flows and other requirements. As capital inflows during 2007-08 were far
in excess of the normal absorptive capacity of the economy, there was
substantial accretion to foreign exchange reserves by US $ 110.5 billion. The
foreign exchange reserves declined by US $ 23.4 billion from US $ 309.7 billion
as at end-March 2008 to US $ 286.3 billion by end-September 2008 largely
reflecting valuation effects. Excluding valuation effects, the decline was US $ 2.5
billion. Between October 2008 and January 16, 2009 foreign exchange reserves
declined by US $ 34.1 billion to US $ 252.2 billion, including valuation effects.
India’s current level of foreign exchange reserves remains comfortable.
Overall Outlook
42.

At the heart of the global financial crisis lie the non-functional and frozen

financial markets. In sharp contrast to their international counterparts, the
financial system in India has been resilient and stable. Barring some tightness in
liquidity during mid-September to early October, the money, foreign exchange
and government securities markets have been orderly as reflected in market
rates, spreads and transaction volumes relative to those observed during normal
times. India’s banking system remains healthy, well-capitalised, resilient and
profitable. Credit markets have been functioning well and banks have been
expanding credit, notwithstanding the perceptions in some quarters of lack of
adequate credit from the banks to the commercial sector.
43.

Over the last five years, India clocked 8.8 per cent average annual growth,

driven largely by domestic consumption and investment even as the share of net
exports rose. While the benign global environment, easy liquidity and low interest
rates helped, at the heart of India’s growth have been its growing entrepreneurial
spirit and rise in productivity. These fundamental strengths continue to be in
place. Nevertheless, the global crisis will dent India’s growth trajectory as
investments and exports slow. Clearly, there is a period of painful adjustment
ahead of us. However, once the global economy begins to recover, India’s
turnaround will be sharper and swifter, backed by our strong fundamentals and

the untapped growth potential. Meanwhile, the challenge for the Government and
the Reserve Bank is to manage the adjustment with as little pain as possible.

II. Stance of Monetary Policy
44.

Since

September

2008,

international

developments

have

largely

circumscribed domestic policy responses. There have been severe disruptions in
the international money and foreign exchange markets since September 2008.
Policymakers in governments, central banks and in other regulating agencies of
financial institutions around the world responded to the crisis with aggressive,
radical and unconventional measures to restore calm and confidence in financial
markets and bring them back to normalcy. The immediate challenge was to
maintain financial stability, which moved up in the hierarchy of objectives.
Earlier Policy Measures
September 2008
45.

Global financial crisis also had spillover effects on financial markets in

India causing an unusual tightening of liquidity in mid-September, which was
compounded by transient local factors such as advance tax payments. The
domestic equity market was severely affected by the global meltdown of asset
prices. The foreign exchange market also came under pressure. Access to
external financing was constrained following re-pricing of risks and higher credit
spreads. Responding to the evolving situation, the Reserve Bank announced the
following measures on September 16, 2008:
•

A firm assurance to meet any demand-supply gaps of foreign
exchange in the domestic foreign exchange market.

•

A second LAF was re-introduced on a daily basis.

•

Interest rate ceilings on FCNR(B) and NR(E)RA deposits were
increased by 50 basis points each to LIBOR/swap rates minus 25
basis points and LIBOR/swap rates plus 50 basis points respectively.

•

As a temporary measure, scheduled banks were allowed to avail of
additional liquidity support under the LAF to the extent of up to one per

cent of their net demand and time liabilities from their SLR portfolio
and seek waiver of penal interest.
October 2008
46.

Liquidity conditions tightened further in October 2008 as contagion from

the US financial crisis spread to Europe and Asia. Many central banks took cordinated actions to infuse liquidity in their jurisdictions. In addition, in order to
enhance dollar liquidity, the US Fed provided currency swap lines to select
central banks. Financial markets in Asia and Australia were also severely
affected. The call money rate in the domestic market touched a peak of 19.8 per
cent on October 10, 2008 with LAF repo volume crossing Rs.90,000 crore during
the early part of October 2008. In view of persisting uncertainty in global financial
markets and its impact on India and continuing shortage of liquidity reflected in
repo volume, the following measures were taken by the Reserve Bank in October
2008:
•

The CRR was reduced by 250 basis points from 9.0 per cent to 6.5
per cent effective from the fortnight beginning October 11, 2008.

•

A 14-day special repo facility for a notified amount of Rs.20,000 crore
was instituted to alleviate liquidity stress faced by mutual funds, and
banks were allowed temporary use of SLR securities for collateral
purposes by an additional 0.5 per cent of NDTL exclusively for this
purpose.

•

Commercial banks and all-India term lending and refinancing
institutions were allowed to lend against and buy back certificates of
deposit (CDs) held by mutual funds.

•

The Reserve Bank temporarily provided a sum of Rs.25,000 crore as
the first instalment under the Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief
Scheme to scheduled banks and NABARD immediately, pending
Parliamentary sanction and consequent release of funds by the
Central Government.

•

Interest rate ceilings on FCNR(B) and NR(E)RA deposits were
increased further by 50 basis points each to LIBOR/swap rates plus 25
basis points and LIBOR/swap rates plus 100 basis points respectively.

47.

•

Banks were permitted to borrow funds from their overseas branches
and correspondent banks to the extent of 50 per cent of their
unimpaired Tier-I capital or US $ 10 million, whichever is higher.

•

The Reserve Bank announced that it would institute special market
operations to meet the foreign exchange requirements of public sector
oil marketing companies against oil bonds when they become
available.

•

On October 20, 2008 the repo rate under the LAF was reduced by 100
basis points to 8.0 per cent.

•

The systemically important non-deposit taking non-banking financial
companies (NBFCs-ND-SI) were permitted to raise short-term foreign
currency borrowings.

On the eve of announcement of the Mid-Term Review, external

commercial borrowings (ECBs) up to US $ 500 million per borrower per financial
year were permitted for rupee expenditure and/or foreign currency expenditure
for permissible end-uses under the automatic route. Further, the all-in-cost ceiling
for ECBs of average maturity period of three years and up to five years was
raised to 300 basis points, and over five years, to 500 basis points above 6month LIBOR.
November 2008
48.

Global financial conditions continued to remain uncertain and unsettled.

Early signs of a global recession were evident by late October. Globally,
commodity prices, including crude, began to abate which reduced domestic
inflationary pressures. On the growth front, it was important to ensure that credit
requirements for productive purposes were adequately met so as to support the
growth momentum of the economy. Accordingly, the following measures were
taken on November 1, 2008:
•

The repo rate under the LAF was reduced by 50 basis points to 7.5
per cent with effect from November 3, 2008.

•

The CRR was reduced by 100 basis points from 6.5 per cent to 5.5
per cent of NDTL.

•

The statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), which was relaxed on a temporary
basis earlier, was made permanent and reduced to 24 per cent of
NDTL effective November 8, 2008.

•

In order to provide further liquidity comfort, a special refinance facility
for scheduled commercial banks (excluding RRBs) up to 1.0 per cent
of each bank’s NDTL as on October 24, 2008 was introduced under
Section 17(3B) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 up to a
maximum period of 90 days.

•

On October 15, 2008 the Reserve Bank introduced a 14-day special
repo facility allowing banks to avail additional liquidity support
exclusively for the purpose of meeting the liquidity requirements of
mutual funds to the extent of 0.5 per cent of their NDTL.
Subsequently, this facility was extended for NBFCs and the relaxation
in the maintenance of the SLR was enhanced to the extent of up to 1.5
per cent of their NDTL.

•

Buy-back of MSS dated securities was announced to provide another
avenue for injecting liquidity to be calibrated with the market borrowing
programme of the Government of India.

49.

On November 7, 2008 Indian public and private sector banks that have

foreign branches or subsidiaries were provided a forex swap facility of tenor up to
three months with the Reserve Bank. Further, for funding the swap, banks were
allowed to borrow under the LAF for the corresponding tenor at the prevailing
repo rate.
50.

There were indications that the global slowdown was deepening with a

larger than expected impact on the domestic economy, particularly for the
medium and small industry sector and export-oriented units. In the context of
these developments, further augmenting rupee and forex liquidity, and
strengthening and improving credit delivery mechanisms were needed for
sustaining the growth momentum. Accordingly, the following measures were
taken on November 15, 2008:
•

The

special

term

repo

facility

introduced

for

the

purpose

of meeting the liquidity requirements of MFs and NBFCs, was
extended till end-March 2009. Banks can avail of this facility either on

an incremental basis or on a rollover basis within the entitlement of up
to 1.5 per cent of their NDTL.
•

Interest rate ceilings on FCNR(B) and NR(E)RA deposits were further
raised by 75 basis points each to LIBOR/swap rates plus 100 basis
points and LIBOR/swap rates plus 175 basis points respectively.

•

Housing finance companies (HFCs) registered with the National
Housing Bank (NHB) were permitted to raise short-term foreign
currency borrowings under the approval route.

•

The Reserve Bank permitted Indian corporates to prematurely buy
back their FCCBs at prevailing discounted rates.

•

The period of entitlement of the first slab of pre-shipment rupee export
credit was extended from 180 days to 270 days.

•

The aggregate limit of export credit refinance (ECR) facility for
scheduled banks (excluding RRBs) was enhanced from 15 per cent to
50 per cent of the outstanding export credit eligible for refinance.

•

SIDBI and the NHB were allocated Rs. 2000 crore and Rs.1000 crore
respectively against banks’ estimated shortfall in priority sector lending
in March 2009.

•

Banks were encouraged to use the special refinance facility under
Section 17(3B) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 for the purpose
of lending to micro and small enterprises.

•

The provisioning requirements for all types of standard assets were
reduced to a uniform level of 0.40 per cent, except in the case of direct
advances to the agricultural and SME sectors which continue to attract
provisioning of 0.25 per cent, as hitherto.

•

Risk weights on banks’ exposures to all unrated claims on corporates,
claims secured by commercial real estate and claims on NBFCs-NDSI were reduced to 100 per cent from 150 per cent.

51. On November 28, 2008 the Reserve Bank announced the following
measures for liquidity management and improving credit flows:

•

The special refinance facility under Section 17(3B) of the Reserve
Bank of India Act, 1934 introduced on November 1, 2008 was
extended up to June 30, 2009.

•

The special term repo facility was expanded to enable banks to
accommodate the funding needs of HFCs. The facility was extended
up to June 30, 2009.

•

The forex swap facility of tenor up to three months was extended up to
June 30, 2009.

•

The period of entitlement of the first slab of post-shipment rupee
export credit was extended from 90 days to 180 days.

December 2008
52.

The global outlook deteriorated further during December 2008. There were

indications that the recession would be deeper and the recovery longer than
anticipated earlier. There was also increasing evidence of slackening of domestic
economic activity. The available data indicated that the demand for bank credit
started moderating despite comfortable liquidity. The reduction in prices of petrol
and diesel announced on December 5, 2008 further eased inflationary pressures.
To improve the credit flow to productive sectors at viable costs so as to sustain
the growth momentum, the Reserve Bank took the following measures on
December 6 and 11, 2008:
•

The repo rate was reduced under the LAF by 100 basis points from
7.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent and the reverse repo rate by 100 basis
points from 6.0 per cent to 5.0 per cent, effective December 8, 2008.

•

A refinance facility was introduced for SIDBI, NHB and EXIM Bank for
Rs. 7,000 crore, Rs.4,000 crore and Rs.5,000 crore respectively. This
facility will be available up to March 31, 2010.

•

Authorised Dealers Category-I banks were permitted to consider
applications for premature buy-back of FCCBs from their customers.

•

Loans granted by banks to HFCs for on-lending for housing up to
Rs.20 lakh per dwelling unit were classified under priority sector.

•

Commercial real estate exposures restructured up to June 30, 2009
were allowed to be treated as standard assets. As a one-time

measure, the second restructuring done by banks of exposures (other
than exposures to commercial real estate, capital market exposures
and personal/consumer loans) up to June 30, 2009 was also made
eligible for concessional regulatory treatment.
•

The prescribed interest rate as applicable to post-shipment rupee
export credit (not exceeding BPLR minus 2.5 percentage points) was
extended to overdue bills up to 180 days.

January 2009
53.

While domestic financial markets continued to function in an orderly

manner, India’s growth trajectory was impacted both by the global financial crisis
and the follow-on global economic downturn. This impact turned out to be deeper
and wider than earlier anticipated. Concurrently, because of fall in global
commodity prices coupled with supply and demand management measures at
home, headline inflation was on the decline. Even as some public sector and
private sector banks had cut lending rates in response to the Reserve Bank’s
monetary policy stance, concerns over rising credit risk together with the slowing
of economic activity appeared to have moderated credit growth. Accordingly, in
order to stimulate growth, the Reserve Bank took the following further measures
on January 2, 2009:
•

The repo rate under the LAF was reduced by 100 basis points from
6.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent with effect from January 5, 2009.

•

The reverse repo rate under the LAF was reduced by 100 basis
points from 5.0 per cent to 4.0 per cent with effect from January 5,
2009.

•

The CRR was reduced from 5.5 per cent to 5.0 per cent of NDTL
effective from the fortnight beginning January 17, 2009.

54. The Government has announced the setting up of a special purpose
vehicle (SPV) for addressing the temporary liquidity constraints of systemically
important non-deposit taking non-banking financial companies (NBFCs-ND-SI).
The mechanism would be as follows: The SPV would issue government
guaranteed securities to the Reserve Bank. The SPV will, in turn, use the funds
to acquire only investment grade commercial papers and non-convertible
debentures of the NBFCs. During its appraisal, the SPV will ensure that the

NBFCs use the money only for addressing liquidity constraints and not for
business expansion. The total support from the Reserve Bank will be limited to
Rs.20,000 crore with an option to raise it by a further Rs.5,000 crore. The facility
will be available for a limited period to address current liquidity concerns of
NBFCs.
Liquidity Impact
55. The cumulative reduction in the CRR by 400 basis points since midSeptember 2008 released additional Rs.1,60,000 crore of primary liquidity.
Unwinding of MSS has released primary liquidity of a little over Rs.63,000 crore.
Further, potential liquidity has been made available through various refinance
facilities for banks and financial institutions to the tune of Rs.80,000 crore. The
term repo facility gives an additional potential liquidity of Rs.60,000 crore. The
SPV for NBFC will augment potential liquidity by another Rs.25,000 crore. In
sum, the actions of the Reserve Bank since mid-September 2008 have resulted
in augmentation of actual/potential liquidity of over Rs.3,88,000 crore. In addition,
the permanent reduction in SLR by 1.0 per cent of NDTL has made available
liquid funds of the order of Rs.40,000 crore for the purpose of credit expansion
(Table 13).

The liquidity situation has improved significantly following several

measures taken by the Reserve Bank. The overnight call money rate, which

generally hovered above the repo rate during September-October 2008, has
softened considerably and has moved towards the lower bound of the LAF
corridor since early November 2008. Other money market rates such as discount
rate of CDs, CPs and CBLO rate softened in tandem with the overnight call
money rate. The yield on 10-year government securities has remained below 6
per cent since mid-December 2008. The LAF window has been generally in an
absorption mode since mid-November 2008. The liquidity problem faced by
mutual funds appears to have eased considerably. Many commercial banks have
reduced their benchmark prime lending rates since mid-November 2008.
Growth Projection
57.

The Reserve Bank’s Mid-Term Review of October 2008 had estimated real

GDP growth for 2008-09 in the range of 7.5–8.0 per cent. Since then the outlook
on real GDP growth has been affected further and the downside risks to growth
have amplified because of slowdown of industrial activity and weakening of
external demand as reflected in decline in exports. Services sector activities are
likely to further decelerate in the second half of 2008-09. Keeping in view the
slowdown in industry and services and with the assumption of normal agricultural
production, the projection of overall real GDP growth for 2008-09 is revised
downwards to 7.0 per cent with a downward bias.
Inflation Projection
58.

Pressures on commodity prices have abated markedly around the world,

reflecting slump in global demand. The sharp decline in crude oil prices together
with the slide in prices of metals, foodgrains and cement has influenced inflation
expectations in most parts of the world. In the domestic market, inflation in terms
of the wholesale price index is already below 7.0 per cent, which was projected
earlier for end-March 2009. While prices of manufactured products and of the
fuel group have declined in line with international trends, inflation on account of
primary articles still remains at the double digit level, reflecting sustained price
pressures, particularly on food articles. As per current assessment, the inflation
rate is expected to moderate further in the last quarter of 2008-09. Keeping in
view the global trend in commodity prices and the domestic demand-supply
balance, WPI inflation is now projected to decelerate to below 3.0 per cent by
end-March 2009.

59.

Notwithstanding the projected decline in headline WPI inflation, it needs to

be noted that consumer price inflation is yet to moderate and the decline in
inflation expectations has not been commensurate with the sharp fall in WPI
inflation. Even within aggregate WPI inflation, the primary articles inflation is still
in double digits. Similarly, WPI inflation excluding food and fuel remains higher
this year as compared with the previous year. In view of the divergent movement
of various price indices and their components, and overall increase in global
economic uncertainties, an assessment of underlying inflation for policy purposes
becomes inherently complex. With WPI inflation having moderated significantly,
consumer price inflation would also decline, though with a lag. Towards its policy
endeavour of ensuring price stability with well-anchored inflation expectations,
the Reserve Bank will take into account the behaviour of all the price indices and
their components.

The conduct of monetary policy would continue to condition and contain

perception of inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent so that an inflation rate of
around 3.0 per cent becomes the medium-term objective, consistent with India’s
broader integration into the global economy and with the goal of maintaining selfaccelerating growth over the medium-term. However, it is recognised that the
headline WPI inflation could fall well below 3.0 per cent in the short-run partly
because of the statistical reason of high base, and the global trends caused by
exceptionally high oil and commodity prices in early 2008.
Monetary Projection
61.

Monetary and credit aggregates continue to expand at a higher rate than

projected in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2008. The liquidity overhang
built-up in recent years due to unprecedented surge in capital inflows, however,
is gradually diminishing. The Reserve Bank is committed to provide adequate
liquidity for all productive activities on a continuous basis. As the upside risks to
inflation have declined, monetary policy has been responding to slackening
economic growth in the context of significant global stress. Accordingly, the
projection of money supply (M3) growth for 2008-09 is raised to 19.0 per cent
from 16.5-17.0 per cent earlier. Consistent with this, the aggregate deposit
growth for 2008-09 is revised to 19.0 per cent from 17.0 per cent earlier. The
projection of growth of adjusted non-food credit, including investment in

bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate
sector and CP, for 2008-09 is revised to 24.0 per cent from 20.0 per cent earlier.
As always, these numbers are provided as indicative projections and not as
targets.
Overall Assessment
62.

As indicated earlier, India has been affected by the global financial crisis

through the financial and real channels. There is considerable dismay about why
this should be the case when, in fact, India’s financial system is sound and
healthy, and its merchandise exports constitute only 13.5 per cent of GDP. The
answer clearly is that India has rapidly integrated into the global system and has
linkages with the rest of the world not just through trade channels, but also
through two-way movements of capital and finance. As an integral part of a
globalising world, India cannot be expected to remain immune to a global crisis of
this nature and magnitude; and in responding to the crisis, India has to share the
uncertainty on the way forward just like the rest of the world.
63.

Both the Government and the Reserve Bank have acted to protect the

economy from the adverse impact of the crisis. While the Government has
announced two major fiscal stimulus packages, the endeavour of the Reserve
Bank has been to provide ample rupee liquidity, ensure comfortable dollar
liquidity and maintain a monetary policy environment conducive for the continued
flow of credit to productive sectors. Towards this endeavour, the Reserve Bank
has adopted both conventional measures such as, for example, reduction of the
CRR, as well as unconventional measures such as, for example, the dollar swap
facility for banks.
64.

Measures aimed at expanding rupee liquidity included significant reduction

in the CRR, a special repo window under the LAF for banks for on-lending to
non-banking financial companies, housing finance companies and mutual funds,
and a special refinance facility that banks can access without any collateral. The
Reserve Bank is also unwinding the MSS securities roughly synchronised with
the government borrowing programme in order to manage liquidity. In addition,
an SPV is being set up to provide liquidity support to NBFCs.
65.

Measures aimed at managing forex liquidity include upward adjustment of

the interest rate ceilings on the FCNR(B) and NR(E)RA deposits, substantial

relaxation of the ECB regime, allowing NBFCs/HFCs access to foreign borrowing
and allowing corporates to buy back FCCBs to take advantage of the discount in
the prevailing depressed global markets. The Reserve Bank has also instituted a
rupee-dollar swap facility for banks with overseas branches to give them comfort
in managing their short-term funding requirements.
66.

Measures to encourage flow of credit to sectors that are coming under

pressure include extension of the period of pre-shipment and post-shipment
credit for exports, expansion of the refinance facility for exports, counter-cyclical
adjustment of provisioning norms for all types of standard assets barring some
exceptions, reduction of risk weights on banks’ exposure to certain sectors which
had been increased earlier counter-cyclically, and expansion of the lendable
resources available to the Small Industries Development Bank of India, the
National Housing Bank and the Export-Import Bank of India.
67.

To improve the flow of credit to productive sectors at viable costs so as to

sustain the growth momentum, the Reserve Bank signalled a lowering of the
interest rate structure by significantly reducing both its key policy rates – the repo
rate and the reverse repo rate. The SLR has also been reduced by one
percentage point releasing funds to banks for credit deployment.
68.

In the context of tightening liquidity in the recent period, the major

challenge for the Reserve Bank has been to infuse liquidity in the system and
assure the markets that it will continue to maintain a comfortable liquidity
position. Accordingly, the policy actions of the Reserve Bank since midSeptember 2008 have resulted in the augmentation of active/potential liquidity in
the system of over Rs.3,88,000 crore. The Reserve Bank has also assured
market participants that it will endeavour to maintain the overnight money market
rates within the LAF corridor. The Reserve Bank will continue to pursue this
stance of ensuring ample liquidity in the market and maintaining the overnight
money market rates within the LAF corridor. In order to do so, the Reserve Bank
will, as in the past, employ both conventional and unconventional measures.
69.

The Reserve Bank has acted aggressively and pre-emptively on monetary

policy accommodation, particularly through interest rate cuts in terms of both
magnitude and pace. In the space of just one quarter, the repo rate has been
reduced from 9.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent and the reverse repo rate from 6.0 per

cent to 4.0 per cent, thereby bringing down both of them to historically lowest
levels. The transmission of the policy interest rate signal has been effective in the
money and government securities markets; however, the transmission in the
credit market has so far been subdued. Most banks have reduced lending and
deposit rates to some extent, but a few have yet to do so. In the Reserve Bank’s
view, the policy easing done by it in the last few months allows for considerable
room for banks to respond more actively to the policy cues.
70.

As indicated earlier, the demand for credit from the banking sector has

increased as other sources of funds to the commercial sector have shrunk.
Available information (as on January 23, 2009) suggests that the total flow of
resources to the commercial sector from all sources, estimated at about
Rs.4,85,000 crore during the fiscal year 2008-09 so far, has been lower than
about Rs.4,99,000 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. While
bank credit has substituted for the shortfall in other sources of funds to some
extent, a complete substitution has so far not taken place.
71.

Given the uncertain outlook of resource availability from both external and

non-bank domestic sources,

the Reserve Bank has raised its indicative

projection of total flow of credit from the banking sector to the commercial sector
to 24.0 per cent for 2008-09 from 20.0 per cent envisaged in the Annual Policy
Statement. With a view to enabling banks to sustain the current level of credit
flow alongside an enhanced government market borrowing programme, the
Reserve Bank’s monetary operations will be conducted so as to be consistent
with the revised indicative money supply projection of 19.0 per cent for 2008-09,
higher than the 16.5-17.0 per cent envisaged in the Annual Policy Statement.
72.

To arrest the moderation in economic growth, it is critical that banks

expand the flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy and do so at
viable rates. At the same time, banks should monitor their loan portfolios and
take early action to prevent delinquencies down the road, and safeguard the
gains of the last several years in improving asset quality. The Reserve Bank
appreciates that risk management is a difficult task in normal circumstances; it is
even more challenging in an environment of uncertainty and downturn. Towards
this shared endeavour of maintaining the flow of credit to productive sectors, the

Reserve Bank will take calibrated monetary policy actions as necessary and at
the appropriate time.
73.

Although the origins of the crisis are common around the world, the crisis

has impacted different economies differently. Importantly, in advanced
economies where it originated, the crisis spread from the financial sector to the
real sector. In emerging economies, the transmission of external shocks to
domestic vulnerabilities has typically been from the real sector to the financial
sector. Countries have responded to the crisis depending on their specific
country circumstances. In particular, while policy responses in advanced
economies have had to contend with both the financial crisis and recession, in
India, the policy response has been predominantly driven by the need to arrest
moderation in economic growth. Our ability to respond has been facilitated by the
continued smooth functioning of our financial markets and the well-capitalised
and healthy banking system. Thus, even as policy responses across countries
are broadly similar, their precise design, quantum, sequencing and timing have
varied. This has been the case with India too. While we have certainly studied
and evaluated measures taken by other central banks around the world, we have
calibrated and designed our responses keeping in view India’s specific economic
context.
Policy Stance
74.

Keeping in view the above assessment of the global scenario and

domestic economy, particularly the outlook on growth and inflation, the stance of
monetary policy for the rest of 2008-09 will be as follows:
•

Provision of comfortable liquidity to meet the required credit growth
consistent with the overall projection of economic growth.

•

Respond swiftly and effectively with all possible measures as
warranted by the evolving global and domestic situation impinging on
growth and financial stability.

•

Ensure a monetary and interest rate environment consistent with price
stability, well-anchored inflation expectations and orderly conditions in
financial markets.

75.

Given the uncertain outlook on the global crisis, it is difficult to precisely
anticipate every development. The Reserve Bank will continue to
maintain vigil, monitor domestic and global developments, and take
swift and effective action to minimise the impact of the crisis and
restore the economy to its potential growth path with price stability. The
response to the Reserve Bank’s policy actions over the last several
months is still unfolding. As demonstrated in the recent past,

the

Reserve Bank will act swiftly and decisively as and when evolving
external and domestic conditions so warrant.

III. Monetary Measures

Bank Rate
76.

The Bank Rate has been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent.

Repo Rate/Reverse Repo Rate
77.

The repo rate under the LAF has been kept unchanged at 5.5 per cent.

78.

The reverse repo rate under the LAF has been kept unchanged at 4.0 per cent.

79. The Reserve Bank has the flexibility to conduct repo/reverse repo auctions at a
fixed rate or at variable rates as circumstances warrant.
80. The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight or longer term
repo/reverse repo under the LAF depending on market conditions and other relevant
factors. The Reserve Bank will continue to use this flexibly including the right to
accept or reject tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit, so as to
make efficient use of the LAF in daily liquidity management.
Cash Reserve Ratio
81. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks has been kept unchanged at
5.0 per cent of NDTL.
Liquidity Facilities
82. The Reserve Bank has allowed banks to avail liquidity support under the LAF
for the purpose of meeting the funding requirements of mutual funds (MFs), nonbanking financial companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs)
through relaxation in the maintenance of SLR up to 1.5 per cent of their NDTL.

Second, a special refinance facility for scheduled commercial banks (excluding
RRBs) was provided by the Reserve Bank on November 1, 2008 under Section 17
(3B) of the RBI Act, 1934 up to 1.0 per cent of each bank’s NDTL as on October 24,
2008. Both these facilities are currently available up to June 30, 2009. In order to
ensure that banks continue to have flexibility in their liquidity management
operations in the current market conditions, it has been decided:
•

To extend both the refinance facilities up to September 30, 2009.

Annual Policy Statement 2009-10
83.

The Annual Policy Statement for 2009-10 will be announced on April 21, 2009.
