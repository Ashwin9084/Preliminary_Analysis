Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2012-13
By

Governor
Introduction

demand and domestic structural
bottlenecks has slowed down growth in
most other EDEs. Furthermore,
inflationary pressures persist in some of
them. Overall, global economic prospects
have improved modestly since the SQR
even as significant risks remain.

Since the Second Quarter Review
(SQR) of Monetary Policy in October
2012, headwinds holding back the global
economy have begun to abate gradually,
although sluggish conditions prevail. In
the US, activity gathered momentum in
Q3 of 2012 but this is unlikely to have
been sustained in Q4. While a political
consensus to avert the ‘fiscal cliff’ has
calmed financial markets, how the debt
ceiling is managed will be crucial in
shaping market sentiment on the way
forward. The euro area economy is
threatened by continuing contraction,
notwithstanding the liquidity firewall of
the European Central Bank (ECB) and
the commitment to act collectively to
backstop the union. Overall, however,
risks of the sovereign debt crisis
disrupting the global financial system
have ebbed. Japan has re-entered
recession. Among the emerging and
developing economies (EDEs), a pick-up
in the pace of growth in China is likely.
A combination of a slump in external

2.
Domestically, growth remains
sluggish, notwithstanding some tentative
signs of the slowdown beginning to level
off. Industrial activity weakened,
reflecting subdued manufacturing,
deceleration in electricity generation and
contraction in mining activity. While the
series of policy measures announced by
the Government has boosted market
sentiment, the investment outlook is still
lacklustre, especially in terms of demand
for new projects. Consumption demand
too is slowing. As regards prospects for
agriculture, whether the rabi output will
offset the shortfall in the kharif output is
as yet unclear. Lead indicators of service
sector activity point to an expansion in
the months ahead, albeit constrained by
the drag imposed by depressed global
demand conditions.
1

3.
Headline wholesale price
inflation, led by non-food manufactured
products inflation, has softened through
Q3, providing some relief from the
persistence that dominated the first half
of the year. On the other hand, food
inflation has edged up, pushing up
consumer price inflation in turn. Lead
indicators such as weaker pricing power
of corporates, excess capacity in some
sectors, the possibility of international
commodity prices stabilising as assessed
by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and momentum measures suggest
that inflationary pressures have peaked.
However, further moderation in domestic
inflation going into 2013-14 is likely to
be muted as the correction of underpricing of administered items is still
incomplete and food inflation remains
elevated. Accordingly, the setting of
monetary policy has to remain sensitive

to conflicting pressures and attendant
risks.
4.
This policy review is accordingly
set in the context of a slowly improving
global environment and a tipping
point in the balance of risks between
growth and inflation on the domestic
front. It should be read and understood
together with the detailed review
in Macroeconomic and Monetary
Developments released yesterday by the
Reserve Bank.
5.
This Statement is organised in
four sections: Section I provides an
overview of global and domestic
macroeconomic developments; Section
II sets out the outlook and projections for
growth, inflation and monetary
aggregates; Section III explains the
stance of monetary policy; and Section
IV specifies the monetary measures.

I. The State of the Economy
Global Economy

has embarked on a fresh fiscal stimulus
following contraction in Q3. In the UK,
a modest GDP growth in Q3 was
followed by a decline in Q4. The HSBC
Emerging Market Index rose in Q4. The
global composite purchasing managers’
index (PMI) also rose marginally in
December.

6.
Signs of stabilisation in global
economic activity have been in evidence
in recent months, led by stronger than
expected growth in the US in Q3,
acceleration in the pace of activity in
China and a pick-up in industrial
production in EDEs in Q4. Activity in
the euro area continues to be in a
contraction mode, though financial
market confidence has improved. Japan

7.
According to the IMF, consumer
price inflation has eased in both
advanced economies (AEs) and EDEs
2

in 2012. However, risks to the inflation
outlook from commodity price pressures
persist.

8.1 per cent in September 2012 to 7.2 per
cent by December. Notably, inflation on
account of non-food manufactured
products, which have a weight of 55 per
cent in the WPI, fell sharply in NovemberDecember as input price pressures eased
primarily on the back of ebbing metal,
non-metallic minerals and chemicals
group inflation. The seasonally adjusted
three-month moving average annualised
inflation also suggests a moderation in
headline as well as non-food
manufactured products inflation. With
the industrial outlook survey also
pointing to softening of the rate of
increase of output prices, the pricing
power of corporates seems to have
weakened. Fuel group inflation
moderated in December, mainly
reflecting the tempering of inflation of
non-administered petroleum products as
well as the range-bound exchange rate
of the rupee.

Domestic Economy
8.
Year-on-year (y-o-y) real GDP
growth slowed from 5.5 per cent in Q1
of 2012-13 to 5.3 per cent in Q2. The
decline in the GDP growth rate became
broad based, with consumption demand
also slowing alongside stalling
investment and declining exports. On the
supply side, there are indications of
weakening resilience of services to
sluggish global growth.
9.
Looking ahead, there are some
tentative signs of a reversal in momentum.
While industrial production slowed to a
y-o-y increase of 1.0 per cent in AprilNovember 2012, the seasonally adjusted
three-month moving average of the index
of industrial production (IIP) points to a
pick-up. The manufacturing PMI rose in
December on the back of higher order
book volumes and new export orders.
The services purchasing managers’ index
(PMI) also rose in December on
expectations of a revival of demand. The
Reserve Bank’s industrial outlook survey
indicates positive business sentiment in
Q3 and Q4. Coverage under rabi sowing
has been broadly the same as in the
corresponding period of last year.

11.
Food inflation, on the other hand,
showed a contrarian behaviour, moving
into double digits in December.
Significant price pressures emanated
from cereals. Prices of pulses and other
protein-based food items remained
elevated. Furthermore, with the firming
up of prices of edible oils and grain mill
products, the overall momentum in food
inflation remained firm.
12.
Inflation based on the new
combined (rural and urban) consumer
price index (CPI) (Base: 2010=100) rose

10.
Headline wholesale price index
(WPI) inflation eased significantly from
3

significant deceleration while credit to
agriculture registered an increase.

to 10.6 per cent in December, largely
reflecting the surge in food inflation.
Excluding food and fuel groups, CPI
inflation remained unchanged at 8.4 per
cent during Q3.

17.
The estimated total flow of
financial resources to the commercial
sector for the current financial year up to
mid-January was `9.6 trillion, higher
than `8.1 trillion during the corresponding
period last year. This was mainly due to
increase in bank credit and subscriptions
by non-banks to commercial paper.

13.
According to the latest Reserve
Bank’s urban households’ survey,
inflation expectations for Q4 edged up
marginally. Wage inflation in rural areas
remained high, notwithstanding some
recent moderation; as these wage
increases have not been accompanied by
improvement in productivity, they have
imparted inflationary pressures. House
price inflation, as measured by the
Reserve Bank’s quarterly house price
index, also remains elevated on a y-o-y
basis.

18.
As regards monetary policy
transmission during Q3 of 2012-13, the
average term deposit rates of scheduled
commercial banks (SCBs) declined
marginally. Although a few banks
reduced their Base Rates modestly
during the quarter, the weighted average
lending rate as well as the modal Base
Rate remained broadly unchanged over
the quarter.

14.
Analysis of the early results of
corporate performance in Q3 indicates
that both sales and expenditure growth
moderated while profit margins remained
broadly unchanged.

19.
Liquidity conditions tightened
from the second week of November on
account of a build-up in the Centre’s cash
balances, festival-related lumpy increase
in currency demand, and structural
pressures brought on by the widening
wedge between deposit growth and
credit growth. Anticipating liquidity
pressures, the Reserve Bank had lowered
the cash reserve ratio (CRR) successively
in the Mid-Quarter Review (MQR) in
September and in the SQR in October.
In addition, the Reserve Bank conducted
open market operations (OMOs) on five
occasions during December 2012 to

15.
Y-o-y money supply (M3) growth
fell to 12.9 per cent by mid-January and
remained below the indicative trajectory
of 14.0 per cent. This essentially reflected
the deceleration of growth in aggregate
deposits and moderation in economic
activity.
16.
Y-o-y non-food credit growth, at
16.2 per cent by mid-January, was
around the indicative trajectory. However,
bank credit to industry showed a
4

commercial borrowings and foreign
direct investment (FDI) into India. Even
though net capital flows have been
strong, the sheer size of the external
financing requirement imposed by the
large CAD has brought to bear downward
pressures on the rupee which depreciated
in nominal and real terms by January
2013 relative to its level in March 2012.

January 2013, thereby injecting liquidity
of `470 billion into the banking system.
Despite these measures, the average net
LAF borrowings at `910 billion in
January (up to January 27), were above
the Reserve Bank’s comfort level.
20.
The government securities
(G-Secs) market recorded increased
turnover, with yields easing substantially
in January. The equity market rose
further in Q3 of 2012-13 on account of
improved sentiment and pick-up in
inflows from foreign institutional
investors (FIIs).

23.
Various measures undertaken by
the Government since mid-September,
including liberalisation of FDI in retail,
aviation, broadcasting and insurance,
deferment of general anti-avoidance
rules (GAAR), reduction in withholding
tax on overseas borrowings by domestic
companies and setting up of the Cabinet
Committee on Investment have
significantly lifted market sentiment
which, in due course, should spur
investment. Alongside, measures such as
progressive deregulation of administered
fuel prices, with concerted efforts to
adhere to fiscal discipline and carry
forward consolidation can potentially
correct the twin deficits. These policy
actions could help engender stable
macroeconomic conditions and return
the economy to its high growth trajectory.
Further reforms to raise productivity,
improve competitiveness and manage the
supply constraints, including augmenting
energy availability, are crucial for raising
the potential growth path in the mediumterm.

21.
Exports contracted in December
for the eighth month in succession,
reflecting depressed external demand
conditions and structural bottlenecks. On
the other hand, imports rose on the back
of higher oil and gold imports,
consequently widening the merchandise
trade deficit in Q3 compared to its level
a year ago. On top of the large trade
deficit, the slowdown in net exports of
services and larger outflows of investment
income payments is expected to widen
the current account deficit (CAD) further
in Q3, beyond the level of 5.4 per cent
of GDP recorded in Q2 of 2012-13.
22.
So far, net capital flows have been
sufficient to finance the CAD. Higher net
inflows of portfolio investment and
accretions to non-resident deposits
compensated for lower net external

Global Outlook

and downward pressure on wages.
Although inflation receded in a majority
of EDEs during 2012, it remained
stubbornly high in South Asia, Latin
America and the Caribbean. Elevated oil
prices and country-specific supply-side
constraints may continue to put upward
pressure on inflation in EDEs through
2014. Given the subdued global demand,
the IMF forecasts oil prices to somewhat
soften in 2013. However, there are upside
risks from geo-political factors and
supply disruptions.

Growth
24.
While the improvement in global
financial conditions is supportive of
global growth prospects for 2013, the
recovery is likely to be anaemic and is
also fraught with significant downside
risks. The outlook for AEs generally
remains weak. Despite manufacturing
stabilising in Q4 of 2012 and forwardlooking indicators of services activity
showing an uptick, growth in 2013 is
most likely to be tepid in view of the
persisting drag from high unemployment,
continuing deleveraging, financial
fragility, persisting sovereign risks and
fiscal tightening, all feeding into one
another through negative feedback loops.
Breaking out of this downward spiral
will depend on resolute structural
reforms and credible fiscal consolidation.
For EDEs, weakness in external demand
is expected to be a major factor holding
back resumption of strong growth in
2013. Taking stock of all this in its latest
World Economic Outlook update
(January 2013), the IMF revised its
forecast of global growth for 2013
downwards to 3.5 per cent from 3.6 per
cent projected in October 2012.

Domestic Outlook
Growth
26.
The Reserve Bank’s projection of
GDP growth for 2012-13 in the First
Quarter Review (FQR) of July 2012 was
6.5 per cent. In the SQR of October, this
was revised downwards to 5.8 per cent,
signalling increasing global risks as well
as accentuated domestic risks on account
of halted investment demand, moderation
in consumption spending and erosion in
export performance. Since then,
industrial activity has remained subdued.
Sluggish external demand continues to
inhibit improvement in services. While
the coverage of rabi sowing has picked
up, severe winter in certain parts has
endangered crop prospects. New
investment demand, which should be the
key driver of the upturn, continues to be

weak. While the series of policy
initiatives by the Government has
boosted market sentiment, it will take
some time to reverse the investment
slowdown and reinvigorate growth.
Accordingly, the baseline projection of
GDP growth for 2012-13 is revised down
from 5.8 per cent given in the SQR to
5.5 per cent (Chart 1).

possibility of adjustment in other
administered prices. If international
commodity prices, including of crude,
move further downwards, they should
cushion the phased increase in diesel
prices, provided they are not offset by
currency movements. A sustained
reduction in inflation pressure is,
however, contingent upon alleviation of
supply constraints and progress on fiscal
consolidation. This will also help
mitigate the cost-push pressures
stemming from the surge in wages.
Keeping in view the expected moderation
in non-food manufactured products
inflation, domestic supply-demand
balances and global trends in commodity
prices, the baseline WPI inflation
projection for March 2013 is revised
downwards from 7.5 per cent set out in
the SQR to 6.8 per cent (Chart 2).

Inflation
27.
The substantial easing of nonfood manufactured products inflation
over Q3 in an environment of slower
growth and excess capacity in some
sectors suggests that inflation has come
off its peak. However, it is expected to
be range-bound around current levels
due to persisting food inflation, the passthrough of diesel price adjustments over
the next several months and the
7

the last quarter, M3 growth projection for
2012-13 has been scaled down to 13.0
per cent from 14.0 per cent while nonfood credit growth projection is retained
at 16.0 per cent. These numbers, as
always, are indicative projections and
not targets.

28.
Although inflation has remained
persistently high over the past two years,
it is important to note that during the
2000s, it averaged around 5.5 per cent,
both in terms of WPI and CPI, down
from its earlier trend rate of about 7.5 per
cent. Given this record, the conduct of
monetary policy will continue to
condition and contain perception of
inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent.
This is in line with the medium-term
objective of 3.0 per cent inflation
consistent with India’s broader integration
into the global economy.

Risk Factors
30.
Macroeconomic management
going forward is subject to a number of
risks as indicated below:
i)

Monetary Aggregates
29.
Money supply (M3) growth has
been below its indicative trajectory for
2012-13 so far, while non-food credit
growth has been around the projection.
Keeping in view the seasonal pattern for

Domestically, the widening of the
CAD to historically high levels in
the context of a large fiscal deficit
and slowing growth exposes the
economy to the risks from twin
deficits. Financing the CAD with
increasingly risky and volatile flows

vulnerability to sudden shifts in risk

potentially threatening
macroeconomic and exchange rate
stability. Large fiscal deficits will
accentuate the CAD risk, further
crowd out private investment and
stunt growth impulses.
ii)

demand pressures now on the ebb,
the supply constraints need to be
urgently addressed. This will require
developing an adequate, credible
and flexible supply response in
respect of those commodities and
segments of the economy
characterised by structural
imbalances. In the absence of an
effective supply response,
inflationary pressures may return
and persist with adverse implications
for macroeconomic stability.

Global risks remain elevated, with
the potential for spillovers on the
Indian economy through trade,
finance and confidence channels. In
the US, the risk of political inaction
to manage the debt ceiling or even
a sudden onset of fiscal austerity can
lead to turmoil in financial markets,
followed by a downturn in economic
activity. Escalation of the euro area
sovereign debt stress in view of the
continuing absence of credible and
comprehensive policy responses
remains a contingent global risk,
along with geopolitical tensions that
can adversely impact supplies/
prices of key commodities,
particularly of crude oil. These
forces can potentially increase
global risk aversion with
implications for financing of the
CAD.

iv) The key to stimulating growth is a
vigorous and sustained revival in
investment. Achieving this will,
however, depend on a number of
factors such as bridging the
infrastructure gaps, especially in
power and transport, hastening
approvals, removing procedural
bottlenecks, and improving
governance.
v)

iii) Inflation over the last three years has
been a result of demand pressures
as well as supply constraints. With

importance of repairing asset
quality, banks should be discerning
in their loan decisions and ensure
adequate credit flow to productive
sectors of the economy.

III. The Policy Stance
this review is shaped by two major
considerations.

31.
Since October 2011, the stance of
monetary policy shifted to addressing
increasing growth risks as reflected in
the slowing down of the economy. The
monetary policy response was, however,
constrained because of inflation
broadening and persisting at a level much
above what is conducive for sustained
growth. The risk of expectations getting
entrenched in the event of a premature
change in the policy stance was
significant. Notwithstanding the
constraints, the CRR was reduced
cumulatively by 125 basis points during
January-March 2012 to prepare liquidity
conditions for a front-loaded 50 basis
points reduction in the policy repo rate
in April. However, the Reserve Bank had
to pause in its policy rate reduction as
the expected complementary policy
actions towards fiscal adjustment and
improving the investment climate did not
follow, and inflation risks persisted.
Nevertheless, the Reserve Bank
persevered with efforts to ease credit and
liquidity conditions through a 100 basis
points reduction in the statutory liquidity
ratio (SLR) in July and a cumulative 50
basis points reduction in the CRR during
September-October.

33.
First, headline WPI inflation and
its momentum edged down in NovemberDecember on the back of softening of
non-food manufactured products
inflation, even though food inflation has
risen, adversely impacting households’
inflation expectations. The staggered
increase in diesel prices announced
earlier this month will percolate through
to overall costs and inflation; however,
these price pressures will dissipate over
time, and the consequent reduction
entailed in the fiscal deficit will bring
about an enduring reduction in inflation
and inflation expectations. At the same
time, still high input costs and wages
continue to impart upward pressures on
prices. Accordingly, it is critical that even
as the monetary policy stance shifts
further towards mitigating growth risks,
the objective of containing inflation and
anchoring inflation expectations is not
de-emphasised.
34.
Second, growth has decelerated
significantly below trend through
2011-12 and 2012-13 so far and overall
economic activity remains subdued. On
the demand side, investment activity has
been way below desired levels and
consumption demand has started to
decelerate. External demand has also

32.
Against this backdrop of global
and domestic macroeconomic conditions,
outlook and risks, the policy stance in
10

weakened due to the slowdown in global
growth. On the supply side, constraints
in the availability of key raw materials
and intermediates are becoming binding.
In turn, this is being reflected in a
widening of the CAD with adverse
implications for external sustainability.
While the monetary policy stance has
sought to balance the growth-inflation
dynamic through calibrated easing, it is
critical now to arrest the loss of growth
momentum without endangering external
stability. The moderation in inflation
conditions provides the opportunity for
monetary policy to act in conjunction

with fiscal and other measures to stem
the growth risks.
35.
Against this backdrop, the stance
of monetary policy in this review is
intended to:


provide an appropriate interest rate
environment to support growth as
inflation risks moderate;



contain inflation and anchor inflation
expectations; and



continue to manage liquidity to
ensure adequate flow of credit to the
productive sectors of the economy.

IV. Monetary Measures
Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)
Rate

36.
On the basis of current assessment
and in line with the policy stance outlined
in Section III, the Reserve Bank
announces the following policy measures:

39.
The Marginal Standing Facility
(MSF) rate, determined with a spread of
100 basis points above the repo rate,
stands adjusted to 8.75 per cent with
immediate effect.

Repo Rate

The policy actions and the
guidance in this Statement given are
expected to:

42.
As a result of this reduction in the
CRR, around `180 billion of primary
liquidity will be injected into the banking
system.
Guidance
43.
With headline inflation likely to
have peaked and non-food manufactured
products inflation declining steadily over
the last few months, there is an increasing
likelihood of inflation remaining rangebound around current levels going into
2013-14. This provides space, albeit
limited, for monetary policy to give
greater emphasis to growth risks. The
above policy guidance will, however, be
conditioned by the evolving growthinflation dynamic and the management
of risks from twin deficits.

i)

support growth by encouraging
investment;

ii)

continue to anchor medium-term
inflation expectations on the basis
of a credible commitment to low
and stable inflation; and

iii) improve liquidity conditions to
support credit flow.
