Statement by Dr. Y. Venugopal Reddy,
Governor, Reserve Bank of India on the
First Quarter Review of Annual Monetary Policy
for the Year 2008-09
This Review consists of three sections: I. Assessment of
Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments; II. Stance of
Monetary Policy; and III. Monetary Measures. An analytical
review of macroeconomic and monetary developments was
issued a day in advance as a supplement to this Review,
providing the necessary information and technical analysis with
the help of charts and tables.

I. Assessment of Macroeconomic and
Monetary Developments
Domestic Developments
2.
The growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007-08
was revised upwards to 9.0 per cent by the Central Statistical
Organisation (CSO) in its end-May 2008 estimates from the
advance estimates of 8.7 per cent released in February 2008.
As per the revised estimates, real GDP originating in agriculture,
industry and services rose by 4.5 per cent, 8.1 per cent and
10.7 per cent, respectively, in 2007-08 as compared with
3.8 per cent, 10.6 per cent and 11.2 per cent in the previous
year. India's macroeconomic performance in 2007-08 is part of
a phase of exceptionally high growth by historical standards,
occurring as it did on top of 9.6 per cent in 2006-07 and
9.4 per cent in 2005-06. Accordingly, real GDP growth has
averaged 8.8 per cent over the period 2003-08 as compared
with 5.4 per cent in the preceding quinquennium.

3.
The fourth advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture
released on July 9, 2008 placed foodgrains production in 2007-08
at a record 230.7 million tonnes, substantially higher than the
previous high of 217.3 million tonnes in the previous year. The
production of nine major oilseeds and cotton rose by 18.6 per cent
and 14.1 per cent, respectively, in 2007-08; however, the output
of sugarcane and jute declined by 4.2 per cent and 1.4 per cent,
respectively. During the current year's rabi marketing season
(April 1-July 18, 2008), wheat procurement has doubled to 22.5
million tonnes from 11.1 million tonnes in the corresponding
period of the previous year. The total stock of foodgrains with
public agencies increased to 19.8 million tonnes as on April 1, 2008
which was higher than the buffer stock norm of 16.2 million tonnes
and the stock of 17.9 million tonnes a year ago.
4.
The south-west monsoon covered the entire country by
July 10, 2008 – five days ahead of the usual onset. During the
current season so far (up to July 23, 2008), the cumulative
rainfall over the country as a whole has been 98 per cent of
the long period average (LPA). Of the 36 meteorological
subdivisions, 21 received excess or normal rainfall whereas
14 received deficient rainfall and rainfall in one meteorological
subdivision was scanty. The deficient rainfall regions include
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Konkan and Goa,
Madhya Maharashtra and Vidarbha and some north-eastern
States. The Marathwada region recorded scanty rainfall. As on
July 17, 2008 the all-India live water storage in 81 major
reservoirs was 28 per cent of the designated capacity which is
10 per cent higher than the last 10 years' average. According
to the forecast of the India Meteorological Department (IMD)
released at end-June 2008, the rainfall in the south-west
monsoon season (June-September) this year is likely to be nearly
100 per cent of the LPA.
2

5.
Of the normal area of 72.6 million hectares under kharif
foodgrain crops, 29.0 million hectares were sown by July 18
this year, higher than 25.9 million hectares in the corresponding
period last year. As regards commercial crops, the area sown
under major oilseeds and jute was higher by 2.1 per cent and
22.5 per cent, respectively, whereas acreage under cotton and
sugarcane declined by 16.9 per cent and 18.2 per cent,
respectively, due to deficient rainfall in the major producing
regions.
6.
The index of industrial production (IIP) rose by 5.0 per cent
during April-May 2008 vis-à-vis 10.9 per cent a year ago.
Manufacturing output slowed to 5.3 per cent from 11.8 per cent
during the same period. Electricity generation also decelerated
to 1.7 per cent from 9.0 per cent, while mining activity picked
up by 5.6 per cent as compared with 3.2 per cent a year ago.
Within manufacturing, beverages, tobacco and related products,
basic chemicals and chemical products and transport equipments
and parts recorded double-digit growth. The production of basic
metals and alloys, leather and fur products, cotton textiles, textile
products and non-transport machinery and equipment recorded
lower growth than during the corresponding period of 2007-08.
The output of industries such as food products, rubber, plastic,
petroleum and coal products, jute textiles, wood and wood
products and metal products (non-machinery) declined. In terms
of the use-based classification of industries, the loss of
momentum was diffused across all constituent sub-sectors.
The production of basic, capital, intermediate and consumer
non-durable goods decelerated to 3.5 per cent, 6.5 per cent,
2.3 per cent and 8.8 per cent, respectively, from 9.4 per cent,
16.9 per cent, 9.7 per cent and 15.4 per cent during April-May
2007. Output of consumer durables, however, recorded a higher
growth of 4.8 per cent as compared with 0.8 per cent a year ago.
3

The six infrastructure industries, comprising nearly 27 per cent
of the IIP, posted a lower growth of 3.5 per cent during
April-May 2008 as against 6.9 per cent a year ago. Production
picked up in respect of coal and crude oil whereas deceleration
was recorded in the output of petroleum refinery products,
electricity, cement and finished (carbon) steel.
7.
Full information that has become available in July 2008
on corporate sector activity reveals that moderation from the
high growth phase that began in 2002-03 had set in by the last
quarter of 2006-07. Sales growth of selected non-financial
private companies decelerated from 26.2 per cent in 2006-07
to 18.5 per cent in 2007-08. The growth of operating profits
slowed to 18.6 per cent from 41.3 per cent in the previous year
despite considerable cost-cutting initiatives by companies. The
interest to gross profits ratio at 13.9 per cent in 2007-08 remained
distinctly lower than the ratio of around 50 per cent in the 1990s
and 43.7 per cent in the first half of the current decade. While
there was a substantial rise in the cost of inputs including raw
materials, staff compensation and funding of operations, an
increase of 47.0 per cent in the income from non-core activities
contributed to net profits that rose by 27.0 per cent. As a result,
profitability measured in terms of the ratio of net income to sales
improved to 11.8 per cent as against 10.7 per cent in 2006-07,
with gains for manufacturing and non-IT services sectors. There
was a marginal decline in the profitability ratio for information
technology (IT) companies to 21.5 per cent from 22.7 per cent
in 2006-07.
8.
Early results of selected companies for the first quarter of
2008-09 are mixed, with sustained sales growth, accompanied
by higher expenditure growth on account of increase in cost of
raw materials, staff costs and interest payments. As a result,
4

there was further deceleration in net profit growth, extending a
phase that had set in during 2007-08. The pick-up in sales
growth could be attributed to higher selling prices although
volume growth continued to be the major driver. While investment
conditions continued to be supported by favourable demand
conditions, reliance on external sources of funds increased
somewhat in view of lower retained profits of the selected
companies.
9.
The Reserve Bank's Industrial Outlook Survey conducted
during May 2008 indicates some moderation in business
confidence in the private corporate manufacturing sector. For
April-June 2008, the assessment of growth in production and
order books was somewhat lower than in the previous quarter
and in the corresponding quarter last year. Close to 56 per cent
of respondents reported no change in capacity utilisation. A
majority of respondents also indicated no change in the financial
situation, working capital finance requirements and availability
of finance. Responses relating to export orders, imports and
profits were generally mixed. The business expectations index
for April-June 2008 declined by 5.4 per cent from its level in
January-March, but was marginally higher (by 0.3 per cent) than
in the corresponding quarter a year ago. For July-September
2008, nearly half of the respondents expect an improvement in
the overall business situation and the outlook for production,
order books and capacity utilisation is positive. In continuation
of the assessment for the previous quarter, a majority of
respondents expect no change in the financial situation, working
capital finance requirements, availability of finance and profit
margins. Expectations of rise in input costs and selling prices
appear to have firmed up. The business expectations index for
July-September 2008 is lower by 0.9 per cent than its level in
5

the previous quarter but higher by 0.8 per cent than its level a
year ago.
10. Business sentiment polled by other surveys reflects a
similar though more broad-based moderation. One survey
reported slower growth expectations for output, foreign trade and
pre-tax profits for the next six months. A majority of the
respondent firms propose to increase investments during the
current year. Another survey reported a significant decline in
business optimism due to increase in input costs, global
economic instability and hardening of interest rates but nearly
half the respondents intend to increase their manpower. In yet
another survey, nearly two-third respondents expected increase
in order books, exports and investment and nearly half expected
to increase employment during April-September 2008. A large
majority also expected raw material prices to increase. One
survey's business optimism index recorded significant fall over
the previous quarter as well as over a year ago, with a tempered
outlook diffused across sales volume, inventory levels, new
orders, selling prices, employment and net profits. Profit
expectations moderated for the sixth consecutive quarter on the
view that manufacturers may not be able to pass on the total
increase in input costs to customers in the subdued demand
conditions prevailing in the economy. Seasonally adjusted
purchasing managers' indices for June 2008, however, indicated
an improvement in manufacturing business conditions. Robust
underlying demand and higher new order volumes combined
with expansion plans point to a further increase in employment.
Output prices increased at a faster rate than in the previous
quarter and some improvement was reported in supplier
delivery performance to maintain profitability in view of the rise
in input costs.
6

11. Services sector activity appears to have been sustained
in the first quarter of 2008-09 with indications of moderation in
some sub-sectors. In the communication sector, 0.89 million lines
were added to the switching capacity of telephone exchanges
and 16.5 million new telephone connections (fixed plus cellular)
were provided during April-May 2008 as compared with 11.2
million new subscribers added during the corresponding period
of 2007-08. During the first quarter of 2008-09, railway revenue
earning freight traffic increased by 9.4 per cent as compared
with 5.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2007-08. Cargo handled
at major ports increased by 10.3 per cent during April-May 2008
as against 17.7 per cent a year ago. In civil aviation, handling
of import cargo and export cargo increased by 9.3 per cent and
7.6 per cent, respectively, as compared with 21.7 per cent and
1.6 per cent during April-May 2007. During the first quarter of
2008-09, foreign tourist arrivals increased by 10.2 per cent as
against 8.2 per cent a year ago. There was deceleration in air
traffic growth as passengers handled at domestic and
international terminals increased by 5.9 per cent and 9.0 per cent,
respectively, during April-May 2008 as against 24.4 per cent
and 13.1 per cent, a year ago.
12. During 2007-08, there have been noteworthy shifts in
aggregate demand. In real terms, private final consumption
expenditure (PFCE) and gross fixed capital formation (GFCF)
increased by 8.3 per cent and 13.8 per cent, respectively, as
compared with 7.1 per cent and 15.1 per cent in the previous
year. In nominal terms, PFCE declined to 55.3 per cent of GDP
during 2007-08 from 55.8 per cent in the previous year whereas
GFCF increased to 33.9 per cent from 32.5 per cent.
13. Up to July 4, 2008 non-food credit of scheduled commercial
banks (SCBs) rose by 25.9 per cent (Rs.4,85,709 crore) on a
7

year-on-year basis, higher than 24.6 per cent (Rs.3,69,109 crore)
a year ago. During the current financial year so far, non-food
credit of SCBs increased by Rs.40,344 crore (1.7 per cent) as
against a decline of Rs.12,519 crore (–0.7 per cent) in the
corresponding period of the previous year. Food credit recorded
an increase of Rs.6,322 crore as against a decline of
Rs.2,292 crore in the corresponding period last year.
14. Provisional information on the sectoral deployment of
bank credit available up to May 2008 indicates that on a
year-on-year basis, credit to the services sector recorded the
highest growth (31.3 per cent), followed by industry (26.9 per cent),
the agriculture sector (19.3 per cent) and personal loans
(15.9 per cent). Growth in housing and real estate loans
decelerated to 13.8 per cent (21.6 per cent a year ago) and
31.9 per cent (69.7 per cent), respectively. Within the industrial
sector, there was a sizeable credit pick-up in respect of
infrastructure (41.7 per cent as against 32.6 per cent a year
ago), cement and cement products (54.5 per cent over 18.3
per cent), chemicals (24.8 per cent as against 14.2 per cent)
and petroleum (62.8 per cent as against 51.6 per cent). There
was moderation in credit growth to basic metals and metal
products (24.0 per cent as against 29.3 per cent), textiles
(20.9 per cent as against 32.9 per cent), engineering (23.4 per cent
as against 25.1 per cent), construction (29.6 per cent as against
49.2 per cent) and vehicles (26.7 per cent as against 28.6 per cent).
Credit to industry constituted 43.1 per cent of the total expansion
in non-food bank credit up to May 2008, followed by services
(29.5 per cent), personal loans (17.2 per cent) and agriculture
(10.1 per cent). The share of infrastructure in total credit to
industry increased from 21.2 per cent to 23.7 per cent. On the
contrary, the share of credit to textiles, chemicals, engineering
and metals declined to 10.9 per cent, 7.6 per cent, 6.1 per cent
8

and 12.1 per cent, respectively, from 11.5 per cent, 7.7 per cent,
6.3 per cent and 12.4 per cent. Priority sector advances grew
by 18.3 per cent with a moderation in their share in outstanding
gross bank credit to 34.0 per cent in May 2008 from 35.7 per cent
a year ago.
15. Commercial banks' investments in shares, bonds/
debentures and commercial papers (CPs) increased by Rs.9,510
crore (12.1 per cent) on a year-on-year basis up to July 4, 2008
as against a decline of Rs.1,188 crore (1.5 per cent) a year
ago. During the current financial year so far, such investments
by banks fell by Rs.7,126 crore (7.5 per cent) as compared
with a decline of Rs.4,676 crore (5.6 per cent) in the
corresponding period of 2007-08. Commercial banks invested
Rs.13,810 crore in instruments issued by mutual funds during
the current financial year so far as against Rs.43,066 crore in
the corresponding period of 2007-08. The year-on-year growth
in total flow of resources from SCBs to the commercial sector
was 25.4 per cent (Rs.4,95,220 crore), higher than 23.2 per cent
(Rs.3,67,921 crore) a year ago.
16. The year-on-year increase in aggregate deposits of SCBs
at 21.7 per cent (Rs.5,89,646 crore) up to July 4, 2008 was
lower than 24.6 per cent (Rs.5,36,617 crore) a year ago. On a
financial year basis, aggregate deposits increased by
Rs.1,11,286 crore (3.5 per cent) during 2008-09 up to July 4,
2008 as against an increase of Rs.1,06,646 crore (4.1 per cent)
in the corresponding period of the previous year. The incremental
non-food credit-deposit ratio increased to 82.4 per cent on July
4, 2008 from 68.8 per cent a year ago.
17. Commercial banks' investment in statutory liquidity ratio
(SLR) eligible securities increased by Rs.43,667 crore up to
9

July 4, 2008 as against an increase of Rs.57,653 crore in the
corresponding period of 2007-08. Abstracting securities
committed for liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) operations,
however, banks' investments in Government and other approved
securities would have declined by Rs.18,383 crore as compared
with an increase of Rs.25,469 crore a year ago. Commercial
banks' holdings of Government and other approved securities
was 27.7 per cent of the banking system's net demand and time
liabilities (NDTL) which was marginally lower than 27.8 per cent
at end-March 2008 and 28.7 per cent a year ago. Such
investments were Rs.99,238 crore above the prescribed SLR level
of 25 per cent of NDTL. Adjusted for banks' holding of market
stabilisation scheme (MSS) securities and the collateral securities
repoed under the LAF, commercial banks' holding of SLR
securities was less than 23.0 per cent of their NDTL.
18. Money supply (M3) increased by 20.5 per cent on a
year-on-year basis on July 4, 2008, lower than 21.8 per cent a
year ago. On a financial year basis, M3 increased by 3.5 per cent
(Rs.1,39,475 crore) during 2008-09 up to July 4, 2008 as compared
with the increase of 3.8 per cent (Rs.1,26,058 crore) in the
corresponding period of the previous year.
19. Reserve money increased by 26.5 per cent on a
year-on-year basis on July 18, 2008 as compared with 29.0
per cent a year ago. Currency in circulation increased by 21.6
per cent (Rs.1,11,077 crore), higher than 14.3 per cent
(Rs.64,432 crore) a year ago. There was also a large increase
in bankers' deposits with the Reserve Bank, i.e., of the order of
Rs.95,986 crore on top of Rs.97,923 crore a year ago due to
successive increases in the cash reserve ratio (CRR). During
the current financial year up to July 18, reserve money increased
by 2.5 per cent (Rs.23,281 crore) as compared with the increase
10

of 6.1 per cent (Rs.43,080 crore) in the corresponding period of
the previous year. Among the components, currency in circulation
recorded a higher increase of 5.9 per cent (Rs.34,915 crore) as
compared with 2.1 per cent (Rs.10,539 crore) in the
corresponding period last year. Among the sources of reserve
money, the Reserve Bank's net foreign exchange assets
increased by Rs.75,552 crore, mainly due to revaluation on
account of depreciation of the rupee against other currencies
during the period, as against an increase of Rs.27,735 crore in
the corresponding period last year. Adjusted for revaluation
effects, the Reserve Bank's net foreign currency assets declined
by Rs.18,139 crore as against an increase of Rs.72,947 crore
in the corresponding period of 2007-08. The Reserve Bank's
net credit to the Central Government increased by Rs.55,581
crore as against an increase of Rs.18,875 crore in the
corresponding period last year. Adjusted for issuances under
the MSS, the Reserve Bank's net credit to the Central
Government showed an increase of Rs. 58,628 crore as
compared with an increase of Rs. 40,928 crore a year ago.
20. Under the Special Market Operation (SMO) scheme
announced on May 30, 2008 the Reserve Bank has been
conducting open market operations (OMOs) in the secondary
market against oil bonds held by public sector oil marketing
companies and providing them equivalent foreign exchange
through the designated banks. An overall daily ceiling under the
SMO was initially set at Rs.1,000 crore and subsequently revised
to Rs.1,500 crore on June 11, 2008 on a review of operations.
Public sector oil marketing companies have been provided
US $ 4.3 billion (Rs.19,325 crore) against oil bonds purchased
under the scheme up to July 25, 2008. The SMO is an ad hoc
measure and is being reviewed on a continuous basis with a
view to terminating these operations as soon as feasible.
11

21. During the first quarter of 2008-09, there were some shifts
in liquidity conditions. As end-March balance sheet adjustments
unwound and advance tax payments flowed back into the
banking system with a large drawdown of Central Government's
cash balances, liquidity conditions eased between the first week
of April 2008 and the first week of May 2008. Absorption under
the LAF averaged Rs.26,556 crore during April 2-May 15, 2008
with the peak absorption of Rs.79,005 crore on April 8, 2008.
During April 1-May 21, 2008 there was net absorption of Rs.7,868
crore under the MSS. Under normal 91-day Treasury-bill auctions,
an enhanced amount of Rs.3,000 crore was notified during
May 14-June 18, 2008 for meeting farm debt waiver
commitments. Banks' dependence on export credit refinance
(ECR) fell from a daily average of Rs.820 crore during the
fortnight ended April 11, 2008 to Rs.208 crore in the fortnight
ending May 23, 2008. With increases in the CRR effective from
April 26, May 10 and May 24, liquidity conditions tightened. There
were net injections through the LAF between May 26-July 1, 2008
but for a brief lull during June 2-9, 2008. During June 2008,
however, there was average net injection under the LAF of the
order of Rs.8,622 crore. Advance tax outflows and the
consequent building up of Central Government's cash balances
tightened liquidity conditions further from mid-June 2008. The
increase in the CRR announced on June 24, 2008 in two stages
of 25 basis points each effective from July 5 and July 19, 2008
sucked out an amount of nearly Rs.20,000 crore from the
system. LAF repo operations rose to a peak of Rs.52,315 crore
on July 21, 2008. On a review of liquidity conditions, MSS
auctions were resumed on July 9, 2008. Banks also availed
of ECR in the range of Rs.144 crore - Rs.5,605 crore during
June-July 2008.
22. On a net basis, average daily LAF absorption, which stood
at Rs.2,116 crore in the last quarter of 2007-08, increased to
12

Rs.9,881 crore in the first quarter of 2008-09 but changed to
net injection of Rs.28,730 crore in July so far (up to July 25).
The average daily balances under the MSS increased from
Rs.1,71,090 crore in January-March 2008 to Rs.1,75,588 crore
during April-June 2008 but fell to Rs.1,73,317 crore by July 25, 2008.
Cash balances of the Central Government with the Reserve Bank
fell from an average of Rs.66,844 crore in January-March 2008
to Rs.30,587 crore in the first quarter of 2008-09 and declined
further to Rs.9,109 crore on July 24, 2008. The total overhang
of liquidity as reflected in the balances under the LAF, the MSS
and the Central Government's cash balances taken together
declined from an average of Rs.2,42,370 crore in April 2008 to
Rs.2,12,201 crore in May 2008 and Rs.1,93,726 crore in June
2008 (with an intra-year peak of Rs.2,93,048 crore on April 8, 2008)
before declining to Rs.1,45,200 crore on July 25, 2008.
23. Inflation has increased to a 13-year high and inflation
expectations have been driven up partly by unrelenting pressures
from international commodity prices, particularly crude oil, basic
metals and selected food items. Inflation, measured by variations
in the wholesale price index (WPI) on a year-on-year basis,
increased to 11.89 per cent as on July 12, 2008 from 7.75 per cent
as at end-March 2008 and 4.76 per cent a year ago. Prices of
primary articles and manufactured products rose by 10.15 per cent
and 10.72 per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis as
compared with the increase of 11.13 per cent and 4.80 per cent
a year ago. Prices of the fuel group increased by 16.94 per cent
as against a decline of 1.44 per cent a year ago. Excluding the
fuel group, year-on-year inflation rose to 10.52 per cent from
6.59 per cent a year ago. Similarly, excluding fuel and food,
inflation rose to 11.83 per cent from 5.65 per cent a year ago.
The main drivers of inflation during 2008-09 so far have been
mineral oils (with a weighted contribution of 28.1 per cent), basic
13

metals and alloys (18.8 per cent), oilseeds, edible oils and oil
cakes (13.9 per cent), chemicals and chemical products
(9.5 per cent), milk (2.7 per cent), and minerals (4.1 per cent)
with a total weight of 36.8 per cent in the WPI basket and a
combined contribution of over 77.3 per cent to overall inflation.
On an annual average basis, headline WPI inflation was
5.98 per cent up to July 12, 2008 as against 5.62 per cent
a year ago.
24. Within primary articles, both food and non-food articles
contributed to the price rise with milk, oilseeds, raw cotton and
iron ore being the major components. Year-on-year inflation in
terms of foodgrains prices increased to 5.6 per cent as on
July 12, 2008 from 7.4 per cent in the corresponding period of
the previous year. Prices of some key food items have
decelerated in recent months as record agricultural production
has augmented supply conditions including higher stock of
foodgrains with public agencies. There has, however, been
continuous hardening of the prices of oilseeds since November
2006 due to both domestic and global factors with a
consequential increase in the prices of edible oils and oil cakes.
Iron ore prices also rose on account of high domestic and export
demand.
25. The large contribution of petroleum products, both
administered and freely-priced, in the recent spurt in inflation
needs to be seen in the context of the fact that the pass-through
of oil prices has not been happening on a continuous basis.
The price of the Indian basket of crude oil increased from
US $ 99.4 per barrel in March 2008 to US $ 129.8 in June
2008 and further to US $ 141.5 on July 3, 2008 before declining
to US $ 121.9 on July 25, 2008. While international crude (Indian
basket) prices increased by 129 per cent in US dollar terms
14

and 122 per cent in rupee terms during February 2007-June
2008, the domestic prices of freely priced products increased
by about 76 per cent and the prices of administered products
increased by only around 14 per cent over the same period.
26. On a year-on-year basis, inflation based on the consumer
price index (CPI) for agricultural labourers and rural labourers
increased to 8.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent, respectively, in June 2008
from 7.8 per cent and 7.5 per cent a year ago. Year-on-year inflation
based on CPI for industrial workers and urban non-manual
employees stood at 7.8 per cent and 6.8 per cent, respectively,
in May 2008 as compared with 6.6 per cent and 6.8 per cent a
year ago. The CPI-based inflation measures have increased in
the range of 2.0-3.2 percentage points over their levels in
January 2008.
27. In terms of proportions to budget estimates (BE), revenue
receipts of the Central Government increased to 6.0 per cent in
April-May 2008 from 5.3 per cent during April-May 2007. Plan
expenditure was higher whereas non-Plan expenditure was
marginally lower resulting in the total expenditure rising to
14.6 per cent of BE in April-May 2008 from 13.3 per cent of
BE a year ago. Accordingly, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD)
increased to 54.9 per cent of BE from 41.2 per cent of BE a
year ago. The revenue deficit at 122.7 per cent of the BE during
April-May 2008 was higher than 83.0 per cent in the
corresponding period last year.
28. The gross market borrowings of the Central Government
through dated securities at Rs.72,000 crore (Rs.73,000 crore a
year ago) during 2008-09 so far (up to July 25, 2008)
constituted 41.0 per cent of the BE whereas net market
borrowings at Rs.47,982 crore (Rs.45,232 crore a year ago)
15

constituted 48.5 per cent of the BE. The weighted average yield
and weighted average maturity of Central Government securities
issued during 2008-09 so far were higher at 8.62 per cent and
15.18 years, respectively, as compared with 8.12 per cent and
14.90 years for those issued during 2007-08 (full year). As
against the estimated gross market borrowing of Rs.59,000
crore (net: Rs.44,629 crore), State Governments mobilised
Rs.8,712 crore (net: Rs.3,583 crore) by July 25, 2008.
29.
The Central Government had issued special securities
amounting to Rs.38,050 crore and Rs.40,321 crore, respectively,
during 2007-08 and 2006-07 outside the market borrowing
programme and the MSS. There have been no such issuances
during 2008-09 so far. As mentioned in the Annual Policy
Statement of April 2008 issuances of Government bonds to
public sector oil marketing companies for partial compensation
of their under-recoveries and to fertiliser companies to cover
their under-recoveries/subsidy need to be continuously monitored
in view of the implication for the evolving fiscal outlook.
30. Financial markets reflected the changes in liquidity
conditions during the first quarter of 2008-09. The weighted
average call money rates rose from 6.11 per cent in April 2008
to 7.75 per cent in June 2008 due to tighter liquidity consequent
upon increases in the CRR in April and May 2008 and in the
LAF repo rate on June 12, 2008 and June 25, 2008. The call
rates started moving upwards from June 12 and reached a level
of 9.12 per cent on July 25, 2008. Interest rates in the
collateralised borrowing and lending obligation (CBLO) and
market repo segments moved in tandem with call rates and
increased from 5.05 per cent and 5.48 per cent, respectively, in
April 2008 to 7.21 per cent and 7.42 per cent in June 2008 and
further to 8.51 per cent and 8.64 per cent on July 25, 2008.
16

The daily average volume (one leg) in the call money market
increased from Rs.9,758 crore in April 2008 to Rs.10,854 crore
in June 2008. The corresponding volumes in the market repo
(outside the LAF) were Rs.14,966 crore and Rs.11,262 crore,
whereas in the CBLO segment, the volumes were Rs.38,828
crore and Rs.35,774 crore, respectively. During July 2008 (up
to July 25), the average daily volume in the call, market repo
and CBLO segments were Rs.13,367 crore, Rs.7,255 crore and
Rs.20,501 crore, respectively.
31. There was a marked increase in CP issuances and the
outstanding amount increased to Rs.48,342 crore by mid-July
2008 from Rs.32,592 crore at end-March 2008. The weighted
average discount rate (WADR) on CP, which had declined from
10.38 per cent at end-March 2008 to 8.57 per cent as on May
15, 2008 increased to 10.75 per cent by mid-July 2008. In the
market for certificates of deposit (CDs), the WADR declined
from 10.0 per cent at end-March 2008 to 8.49 per cent as
on April 25, 2008 but subsequently increased to 9.68 per cent
as on July 4, 2008. The outstanding amount of CDs increased
from Rs.1,47,792 crore at end-March, 2008 to Rs.1,64,557 crore
as on July 4, 2008.
32. Yields in the Government securities market hardened
substantially during the current financial year in both primary
and secondary segments. Primary yields on 91-day, 182-day
and 364-day Treasury Bills increased by 184 basis points, 196
basis points and 210 basis points, respectively, over the
end-March 2008 level to 9.06 per cent, 9.32 per cent and
9.45 per cent by July 25, 2008. In the secondary market, yields
on Government securities with one year residual maturity moved
up by 176 basis points over their end-March 2008 level to
9.25 per cent by July 25, 2008. The yields on Government
17

securities with 10-year and 20-year residual maturity also
increased during this period by 117 basis points and 133 basis
points, respectively, to 9.10 per cent and 9.64 per cent.
Consequently, the yield spread between 10-year and one-year
Government securities narrowed from 44 basis points in
March 2008 to (-)15 basis points as on July 25, 2008 whereas
the spread between 20-year and one-year Government
securities narrowed from 82 basis points to 39 basis points
over the same period.
33. Deposit rates of SCBs increased, particularly at the longer
end of the maturity spectrum, during the first four months of
2008-09 (up to July 25). The interest rates of public sector banks
(PSBs) on deposits of maturity from 91 days and up to one
year increased to the range of 5.75-9.25 per cent in July 2008
as compared with 5.25-8.50 per cent in March 2008. The deposit
rates of private sector banks on deposits of both maturity of
one to three years and above three years firmed up to the range
of 8.00-10.00 per cent in July 2008 as compared with the range
of 7.25-9.25 per cent and 7.25-9.75 per cent, respectively, in
March 2008. On the lending side, the benchmark prime lending
rate (BPLR) of PSBs and private sector banks were placed in
the range of 12.75-14.00 per cent and 13.50-17.25 per cent,
respectively, in July 2008 as compared with 12.25-13.50 per cent
and 13.00-16.50 per cent in March 2008.
34. Increased activity in the foreign exchange market was
reflected in a rise in the average daily turnover to US $ 49.4 billion
in July 2008 (up to July 18, 2008) from US $ 44.9 billion a year
ago. While the inter-bank turnover increased from US $ 32.6 billion
to US $ 37.2 billion, the merchant turnover at US $ 12.3 billion
was close to US $ 12.2 billion a year ago. There has been a
hardening of forward premia across all maturities. The six-month
18

forward premia increased from 2.47 per cent at end-March 2008
to 4.70 per cent as on July 25, 2008.
35. The equity markets witnessed a major downturn in both
the primary and secondary segments during the current financial
year so far, continuing the moderation that had set in by early
January 2008. In the primary market, resource mobilisation
through public issues declined sharply as compared with the
corresponding period last year. Resource mobilisation through
private placement and euro issues, however, increased
significantly during the current year so far when compared with
the corresponding period last year. In the secondary market,
the BSE Sensex (1978-79=100) recorded a low of 12576 on
July 16, 2008 before increasing to 14275 by July 25, 2008
which was 8.8 per cent lower than the end-March 2008 level
and 31.6 per cent lower than the peak level of 20873 recorded
on January 8, 2008.
Developments in the External Sector
36. Balance of payments data for January-March 2008 as well
as for the full year 2007-08 were released by the Reserve Bank
at end-June 2008. In US dollar terms, merchandise exports
recorded an increase of 23.7 per cent during 2007-08 on a
payments basis, as against 21.8 per cent in the previous year.
Commodity-wise data released by the Directorate General of
Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S) for 2007-08
indicate a pick-up in the growth of exports of primary products
as well as manufactured goods. Agriculture and allied products,
engineering goods, gems and jewellery and petroleum products
contributed about 69 per cent of export growth during 2007-08.
Merchandise imports on a payments basis rose by 29.9 per cent
19

in 2007-08 as compared with 21.8 per cent in 2006-07. Imports
of petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) increased by 39.4 per cent
on top of the growth of 30.0 per cent in 2006-07 mainly on
account of an increase of 27.4 per cent in the average price of
the Indian basket of crude oil during the year. POL imports in
terms of quantity, however, showed a relatively moderate
growth of 10.1 per cent. Non-oil import payments increased
by 24.4 per cent, mainly on account of strong growth in imports
of capital goods and gold and silver. As a result, the merchandise
trade deficit widened to US $ 90.1 billion (7.7 per cent of GDP)
on a payments basis in 2007-08 from US $ 63.2 billion
(6.9 per cent of GDP) in the previous year.
37. During 2007-08, gross invisible receipts comprising
services, current transfers and income at US $ 145.2 billion
recorded an increase of 26.2 per cent and amounted to nearly
92 per cent of merchandise exports. There was sustained growth
in software exports, travel and transportation along with steady
inflows of remittance from overseas Indians. Private transfer
receipts, mainly comprising remittances from Indians working
overseas, amounted to US $ 42.6 billion as compared with
US $ 29.0 billion in 2006-07. Invisible payments increased by
17.7 per cent during 2007-08, mainly on account of a surge in
travel payments related to outbound tourist traffic as also the
impact of liberalisation of outward foreign exchange remittance
for individuals, business and management consultancy services,
engineering and technical services as well as dividend, profit
and interest payouts. During 2007-08, the net invisibles surplus
was US $ 72.7 billion as compared with US $ 53.4 billion in the
previous year. Accordingly, the current account deficit (CAD)
amounted to US $ 17.4 billion (1.5 per cent of GDP), up from
US $ 9.8 billion (1.1 per cent of GDP) in 2006-07.
20

38. Gross capital inflows to India amounted to US $ 428.7 billion,
while gross capital outflows were of the order of US $ 320.7 billion
during 2007-08. Net capital flows at US $ 108.0 billion were
2.4 times and 4.2 times higher than net capital inflows during
2006-07 and 2005-06, respectively. Sizeable increases in net
inflows were received under portfolio investment, external
commercial borrowings (ECB), foreign direct investment (FDI),
short-term credit and banking capital excluding non-resident Indian
(NRI) deposits. Net FDI inflows amounted to US $ 15.5 billion in
2007-08, sizeably higher than US $ 8.5 billion in 2006-07. Inward
FDI were channelised into sectors such as manufacturing,
construction, business and computer services. Net ECBs of
US $ 22.2 billion were higher than US $ 16.2 billion in the
previous year and were enabled by finer spreads and rising
financing requirements. Net portfolio inflows were significantly
higher at US $ 29.3 billion than US $ 7.1 billion in 2006-07,
mainly due to net foreign institutional investment (FII) inflows at
US $ 20.3 billion as against US $ 3.2 billion, reflecting net
purchases in the Indian stock market as well as resource
mobilisation by the Indian companies through their global
offerings of American Depository Receipts/Global Depository
Receipts (ADRs/GDRs) in view of the favourable external market
conditions. Driven by increased financing requirements of crude oil
imports, net short-term trade credit increased by US $ 17.7 billion
against US $ 6.6 billion in the previous year. Net accretion to
NRI deposits increased marginally by US $ 0.2 billion as
compared with US $ 4.3 billion in the previous year.
39. Reflecting the movements in current and capital accounts
of the balance of payments, the accretion to foreign exchange
reserves (excluding valuation) amounted to US $ 92.2 billion
during 2007-08 which was much higher than US $ 36.6 billion
in 2006-07. Foreign exchange reserves amounted to US $ 309.7
billion at end-March 2008.
21

40. India's external debt increased by 30.4 per cent during
2007-08 and amounted to US $ 221.2 billion at end-March 2008.
The increase was mainly due to ECBs and short-term borrowings
that contributed around 39.5 per cent and 34.8 per cent,
respectively, of the total increase of US $ 51.5 billion in external
debt. Multilateral and bilateral debt registered a moderate
increase. Valuation effects, reflecting the depreciation of the
US dollar against other major international currencies and the
Indian rupee, accounted for US $ 9.9 billion. The US dollar had
a dominant share of 57.1 per cent in India's external debt
whereas rupee-denominated debt had a share of 14.5 per cent.
The share of short-term debt in total debt increased to 20.0 per cent
at end-March 2008 from 15.5 per cent a year ago.
41. Information released by the DGCI&S indicates that exports
increased by 21.7 per cent in US dollar terms during the first
two months of the current financial year, as compared with
24.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.
Imports rose by 31.8 per cent as compared with 37.9 per cent
in the corresponding period of the previous year. While non-POL
imports moderated to 24.6 per cent from 43.8 per cent a year
ago, POL imports increased by 48.6 per cent on account of the
surge in crude oil prices as compared with 25.7 per cent in the
corresponding period of the previous year. As a result, the
merchandise trade deficit widened to US $ 20.7 billion during
April-May 2008 from US $ 13.9 billion in the corresponding period
last year.
42. Available information points to deceleration in capital flows
during the current financial year so far. Portfolio investment in
India recorded net outflows by FIIs amounting to US $ 6.5 billion
22

during 2008-09 (up to July 18, 2008); on the other hand, ADR/
GDR issues by Indian companies amounted to US $ 999 million
during April-May 2008 as compared with US $ 16 million in the
corresponding period last year. Gross FDI inflows during
April-May 2008 were placed at US $ 7.7 billion as against
US $ 3.8 billion a year ago. There were net inflows of
US $ 292 million during April-May 2008 under NRI deposits
as against net outflows of US $ 559 million a year ago. The
foreign exchange reserves declined marginally by US $ 2.6
billion during the current financial year so far and stood at
US $ 307.1 billion on July 18, 2008.
43. The exchange rate of the rupee against the US dollar,
which was Rs.39.97 at end-March 2008, depreciated thereafter
to Rs.43.37 per US dollar on July 8, 2008 before appreciating
somewhat to Rs.42.23 on July 25, 2008. During the current
financial year up to July 25, 2008 the rupee depreciated by
5.4 per cent against the US dollar, by 5.0 per cent against the
euro, by 5.2 per cent against the pound sterling and by 1.3 per cent
against the Japanese yen. As on July 25, 2008 the exchange
rate of the rupee was Rs.42.23 per US dollar, Rs.66.41 per euro,
Rs.83.39 per pound sterling and Rs.39.58 per 100 Japanese yen.
44. The exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided
by the broad principles of careful monitoring and management
of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or a
pre-announced target or a band, coupled with the ability to
intervene, if and when necessary. The overall approach to the
management of India's foreign exchange reserves takes into
account the changing composition of the balance of payments
and endeavours to reflect the 'liquidity risks' associated with
different types of flows and other requirements.
23

Developments in the Global Economy
45. During the first half of 2008, global economic activity
decelerated in an environment of surging inflation and heightened
uncertainty. There are indications that the slowdown is deepening
in the advanced economies and could affect emerging market
economies (EMEs), notwithstanding the strength of domestic
demand. Despite some abatement in the global financial
turbulence and the continuing process of balance sheet repair
for key institutions, financial risks remain high and concerns
about rising losses have exacerbated the pessimism on the
macroeconomic outlook. According to the update of World
Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) released in July 2008, global real GDP growth on a
purchasing power parity basis is expected to decelerate from 5.0
per cent in 2007 to 4.1 per cent in 2008 (3.7 per cent in WEO,
April 2008) and further to 3.9 per cent in 2009 (3.8 per cent in
WEO, April 2008).
46. In the US, real GDP grew by 1.0 per cent in the first
quarter of 2008 as compared with 0.6 per cent a year ago. The
pick-up in growth in the early months of 2008 reflected positive
contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for
services, exports of goods and services, federal government
spending and private inventory investment. On the other hand,
there was a decline in residential fixed investment, imports and
PCE on durable and non-durable goods. Labour markets
weakened with the unemployment rate rising to 5.5 per cent in
May-June 2008. Industrial production dropped by 3.1 per cent in
the second quarter of 2008 vis-à-vis the first quarter of 2008. The
rate of capacity utilisation for industry moved up to 79.9 per cent,
a level 1.1 percentage points below the average for 1972-2007.
US home prices, which had recorded a steep decline in the
24

first quarter of 2008, posted a fall of 15.3 per cent in April 2008
as compared with a year earlier. Single-family housing starts
declined to their lowest level in 17 years in June. The July
home-builder confidence fell to a record low for the third
consecutive month. In June, US retail sales recorded an increase
of 3.0 per cent on account of fiscal stimulus payments.
Consumer sentiment also improved in July from the 28-year low
recorded in June. The index of leading indicators declined
marginally in May-June, continuing the downward trend that
began in the middle of 2007. The IMF's July 2008 update of its
WEO expects the US economy to slow from 2.2 per cent in
2007 to 1.3 per cent in 2008, with the gains in the first quarter
being moderated during the second half of the year as
consumption is dampened by rising commodity prices and tight
credit conditions. The US economy is projected to grow at
0.8 per cent in 2009.
47. Real GDP in the euro area grew by 2.2 per cent in the
first quarter of 2008 on a year-on-year basis as compared with
3.0 per cent a year ago. Growth is forecast to slow down
considerably in the coming quarters. Industrial production is
losing momentum and expectations polled in business surveys
are declining. While unemployment in the euro area fell to
7.2 per cent in May 2008 from 7.5 per cent a year ago, real
disposable income growth is likely to remain weak with increases
in nominal wages eroded by high inflation rates. Private
consumption is expected to grow only modestly in 2008. The
expansion of investment is also likely to moderate. The July
2008 update of the IMF's WEO has placed real GDP growth of
the euro area at 1.7 per cent in 2008 and 1.2 per cent in 2009
as against 2.6 per cent in 2007.
48. The Japanese economy grew by 3.3 per cent in the first
quarter of 2008 as compared with 2.6 per cent a year ago. The
25

pace of growth of business fixed investment and exports has
slowed, corporate profit has deteriorated and business
sentiments have become more cautious. Growth in private
consumption has recently turned sluggish due to continued
increase in food and fuel prices. The July 2008 WEO of the
IMF has projected that Japan's economy will grow by 1.5 per cent
each in 2008 and 2009 as compared with 2.1 per cent in 2007.
49. The Chinese economy grew by 10.1 per cent in the
second quarter of 2008 as compared with 11.9 per cent a year
ago. Currency appreciation, higher wages and rising raw material
costs are being reflected in an erosion of China's export
competitiveness. China's trade surplus for June 2008 was
US $ 21.4 billion as against US $ 26.9 billion in June 2007
on account of deceleration in exports, particularly to the US.
The total foreign exchange reserves, however, increased to
US $ 1.81 trillion in June 2008, recording an increase of
35.7 per cent over June 2007. The CSI 300 Index, which
tracks yuan-denominated A shares listed on China's two
exchanges, has fallen by 30.9 per cent over the year to close
at 2939 on July 25, 2008. The July 2008 WEO of the IMF has
projected that the Chinese economy will grow by 9.7 per cent
in 2008 and by 9.8 per cent in 2009 as compared with 11.9 per cent
in 2007.
50. Elsewhere in Asia, the Korean economy grew by 4.8 per cent
in the second quarter of 2008 as against 4.9 per cent a year
ago. Economic activity is expected to decelerate in 2008 due to
slowdown in domestic demand, rising fuel costs and moderation in
export growth. In Thailand, economic activity grew by 6.0 per cent
in the first quarter of 2008 as against 4.2 per cent a year ago.
51. Inflation has become a global phenomenon in recent
months with no noticeable signs of abatement in the near future.
26

In the US, consumer prices increased from 2.7 per cent in
June 2007 to 5.0 per cent in June 2008. In the euro area,
inflation increased to 4.0 per cent in June 2008 from 1.9 per cent
in June 2007. In Japan, inflation increased to 2.0 per cent in
June 2008 from (-)0.2 per cent a year ago on account of rising
oil and food costs. In the UK, CPI inflation accelerated to
3.8 per cent in June 2008 from 2.4 per cent a year ago. At the
retail level (in terms of retail prices index or RPI), inflation rose
to 4.8 per cent in the UK in March 2007 – the highest since
July 1991. RPI inflation has remained elevated since then and
was 4.6 per cent in June 2008.
52. Core CPI inflation in the US increased to 2.4 per cent in
June 2008 from 2.3 per cent in May 2008. In the UK, core CPI
inflation increased to 1.6 per cent in June from 1.5 per cent in
May 2008. In the euro area, core CPI inflation increased to
1.8 per cent in June 2008 from 1.7 per cent in May 2008. Core
inflation in Japan was at 0.1 per cent in June 2008 as compared
with (-) 0.1 per cent in May 2008. The increase in producer
prices has been sharper than in consumer prices, reflecting
increased input costs. In the US, producer prices increased to
9.2 per cent in June 2008 from 3.3 per cent in June 2007. In
the euro area, producer prices increased to 7.1 per cent in May
2008 from 2.5 per cent in May 2007. In the UK, producer prices
increased to 10.0 per cent in June 2008 from 2.5 per cent in
June 2007. Wholesale price inflation in Japan increased to
4.7 per cent in May 2008 from 1.7 per cent in May 2007.
Overall, the persistence of high food and oil prices at elevated
levels and continued high prices of other commodities pose
significant inflation risks for the global economy and challenges
for monetary policy worldwide.
53. Inflation pressures have raised serious concerns in EMEs
across Asia, Latin America and Africa, mainly on account of
27

supply-demand imbalances in food, fuel and commodity markets.
In China, inflation decelerated from a peak of 8.7 per cent in
February to 7.1 per cent in June 2008 to 8.7 per cent as
compared with 4.4 per cent in June 2007. The Peoples' Bank
of China has raised the required reserve ratio in phases to 17.5
per cent on June 25, 2008. Consumer price inflation in Korea
accelerated to 5.5 per cent in June 2008 from 2.5 per cent in
June 2007. In Thailand, inflation increased to 8.9 per cent in
June 2008 from 1.9 per cent in June 2007. Other EMEs such
as Brazil, Chile and Mexico in Latin America have witnessed
acceleration in their inflation rates in the wake of high inflation
in commodity prices. Producer price inflation in EMEs – both in
Asia and elsewhere – has been substantial in the first half of
2008, driven by escalating commodity prices, particularly energy
and food.
54. In recent months, high food prices have led to serious
difficulties in the form of erosion of purchasing power and
inadequate supplies, especially for vulnerable population groups
that spend a substantial part of their incomes on food. For many
developing countries, the steady rise in world prices of all cereals
has pushed up the food import bill, generating widespread increases
in domestic food prices on imported pressures. The food price
index of the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) increased
by 44 per cent on a year-on-year basis up to June 2008, resulting
in a doubling of global food prices over the past two years. In the
global foodgrains market, prices of major crops such as corn,
soyabean and wheat have increased by 82.7 per cent, 84.2
per cent and 28.1 per cent, respectively, by July 25, 2008 from
their levels a year ago in response to surging demand, sparking
food riots in several countries.
55. Global food imports are forecast by the FAO to be
US $ 1,035 billion, i.e., an additional US $ 215 billion over
28

the level recorded in 2007. The food import bill of the Low-Income
Food-Deficit Countries (LIFDCs) is likely to climb to US $ 169 billion
in 2008, 40 per cent more than in 2007. While the expected
good harvest in the current year may exert a dampening effect
on inflation, food prices are unlikely to ease significantly in view
of the escalated cost of inputs and sustained demand including
the need to replenish stocks. A major factor pushing up
international prices of basic foods has been the low level of
exportable surpluses resulting from domestic utilisation
outstripping production for several crops in a number of major
exporting countries. Restrictions on exports announced by major
foodgrain-exporting nations such as Argentina, Kazakhstan and
Russia for wheat and Cambodia, Egypt, India, Pakistan and
Vietnam for rice continue, imposing pressures on the global food
price inflation. Concerns about weather-related production losses,
surging oil prices and the weaker dollar have also fuelled
speculative demand for agricultural products.
56. The FAO has placed its latest forecast for world cereal
production in 2008 at a record 2,180 million tonnes, 2.8 per cent
up from last year's record level. The bulk of the increase is
expected in wheat which is forecast at 658 million tonnes,
representing an increase of 8.3 per cent over the level in 2007.
Bigger harvests are expected in all regions with the exception
of Asia. Strong demand in domestic and world markets has,
however, depleted stocks in major exporting countries where
production in 2007 suffered from exceptionally poor yields. World
wheat stocks at the close of the season in 2007-08 are forecast
at 151.2 million tonnes, down 6.0 per cent from their already
reduced opening level. World wheat stocks are, however,
expected to increase by 11.5 per cent and reach 169 million
tonnes by the close of the crop season in 2008-09. Wheat prices
have remained generally firm and volatile since October 2007.
29

One-month wheat futures at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)
declined from US $ 9.15 per bushel on January 2, 2008 to
US $ 8.11 on July 25, 2008. On the same day, futures prices
for wheat were quoted higher for December 2008 at US $ 8.35,
for March 2009 at US $ 8.55 and for July 2009 at US $ 8.82
per bushel.
57. Global paddy production in 2008 may rise by 1.4 per cent
to 666 million tonnes as producers in all regions have responded
to high market prices in the first half of the year by increasing
rice cultivation. International near-month futures price of rice on
the CBOT has fallen to US $ 16.72 per hundredweight on July
25, 2008 after a rise of 80.5 per cent since January 2008 to a
high of US $ 24.50 on April 23, 2008. On July 25, 2008 futures
prices were quoted higher at US $ 17.00 for November 2008,
US $ 17.61 for March 2009 and at US $ 18.21 for July 2009.
58. The FAO's forecast for global coarse grains output in 2008
at 1,078 million tonnes is virtually unchanged from last year's
record high. The growth in world coarse grain utilisation is
forecast to slow down in 2008-09 to 1.6 per cent from over 5
per cent in 2007-08 on account of tighter supplies which would
boost usage of wheat and non-grain alternatives for animal feed.
Strong demand for ethanol is the main driver of high prices in
the global coarse grain markets. The futures prices of corn on
CBOT, which had moderated somewhat up to August 2007,
started moving up thereafter and reached US $ 5.77 per bushel
on July 25, 2008. On the same day, futures prices for corn
were quoted higher for December 2008 at US $ 5.97, for March
2009 at US $ 6.16 and for July 2009 at US $ 6.38 per bushel.
59. Metal prices have increased by 14.6 per cent during the
first six months of 2008 after declining by 8.1 per cent during
30

2007. Prices of metals such as aluminium have softened in the
recent period on concerns about global growth which might
impact demand. However, lead and copper prices have
increased on supply concerns and dwindling stocks. Futures price
of copper on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) increased
to a record level of US $ 4.08 per pound on July 2, 2008 from US
$ 3.50 a year ago. As on July 25, 2008, the near-month futures
price for copper stood at US $ 3.70 per pound, US $ 3.61 for
September 2008, US $ 3.59 for December 2008 and US $ 3.50
for July 2009. Spot gold rose to US $ 1002.30 an ounce on
March 17, 2008 - the highest since January 1980 - as the dollar
fell to a record low against the euro and on concerns about
declining supply on mine shutdowns in South Africa, before declining
to US $ 922.71 an ounce on July 25, 2008 from US $ 661.62 a
year ago.
60. Prices of crude oil, which have rebounded since July 2007,
increased by 60.0 per cent up to July 25, 2008 from their level
a year ago. Near-month futures prices reached the level of
US $ 122.51 per barrel on July 25, 2008 dipping from US $ 145.31
recorded on July 3, the highest since trading began on the Nymex
in 1983. On July 25, oil futures ruled higher at US $ 123.26 for
September 2008, US $ 124.62 for December 2008 and US $ 124.83
for July 2009. According to the Energy Information Administration
(EIA), the oil supply system continues to operate at near capacity
and remains vulnerable to both actual and perceived supply
disruptions. World oil markets have been particularly tight during
the first half of 2008, with year-on-year growth in world oil
consumption outstripping growth in non-Organisation of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production by over
1 million barrel per day. The combination of rising global
demand, fairly normal seasonal inventory patterns, slow gains
31

in non-OPEC supply and low levels of available surplus
production capacity is providing firm support for prices.
61. Net non-OPEC production, especially from Russia, the
North Sea and Brazil, could be lower than expected, leading to
both higher demand for OPEC oil and higher prices than
currently projected. Even with increased Saudi Arabian output
at 9.7 million barrels per day from July, available surplus
production capacity during the third quarter would be only
1.2 million barrels per day. World oil consumption is projected
to rise by 1.2 million barrels per day during the second half of
2008 and by 1.4 million barrels per day in 2009. According to
the EIA, the average price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
crude oil is expected to be at US $ 127.39 per barrel in 2008
and US $ 132.75 per barrel in 2009.
62. In the global financial markets, sentiment has been
adversely affected by concerns relating to a deep and prolonged
recession in the US, somewhat alleviated by recent data on
consumer sentiment, durable goods orders, consumer spending
and oil prices. In addition, losses to the financial sector continue
to mount in addition to rising debt defaults. Inter-bank stress
remains high despite unprecedented and sustained central bank
interventions. Banks' wholesale funding remains weak, especially
in the asset backed commercial paper (ABCP) market. There
has also been continued weakness in equities and bond markets
in recent months. The easing of the turmoil does not appear to
be in sight with news about fresh write-downs and job losses
emanating every day, indicating renewed dislocations.
63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard and Poor's
(S&P) 500 and Nasdaq Composite exhibited considerable
volatility and posted declines of 17.5 per cent, 17.2 per cent
32

and 10.6 per cent, respectively, by July 25, 2008 over their levels
a year ago. In the fixed income segment, Government bond
yields in the major economies, which had firmed up in the first
half of 2007, have softened thereafter as demand for government
debt increased with investors seeking safe haven on the
likelihood that the economy is already in a recession. The US
10-year bond yield increased from 4.70 per cent at end-December
2006 to 5.29 per cent on June 12, 2007 before falling to
4.11 per cent on July 25, 2008. The 10-year bond yield in
the euro area increased from 3.95 per cent at end-December
2006 to 4.68 per cent on July 9, 2007 before falling to 4.62 per cent
on July 25, 2008. The Japanese 10-year bond yield has increased
from 1.68 per cent at end-December 2006 to 1.97 per cent on
June 13, 2007 before falling to 1.58 per cent on July 25, 2008.
In emerging markets, however, especially in Asia, there has been
sustained growth in public issues during 2008 so far, despite a
credit crunch in the US and its attendant fall-out on the rest of
the global economy.
64. On a trade-weighted basis, the US dollar has been
depreciating since 2006 with intermittent fluctuations. After the
cuts in the Fed funds rates since September 2007, the US dollar
has weakened against other currencies. The pound sterling
moved to the level of US $ 1.99 on July 25, 2008 – close to
the 26-year high of US $ 2.11 reached on November 8, 2007 –
amidst concerns relating to the US subprime mortgage market.
The euro, which has also been strengthening against the
US dollar since June 2007, rose to an intra-day peak of US $ 1.60
on July 15, 2008 before declining to US $ 1.57 on July 25, 2008.
The New Zealand dollar had appreciated to 81.10 cents to reach
a 22-year peak against the US dollar on July 24, 2007 before
declining to 74.11 cents on July 25, 2008.
33

65. Central banks have continued to work together and to
consult regularly on liquidity conditions in financial markets. In
view of the persistent liquidity pressures in some term funding
markets, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Federal Reserve
and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) announced an expansion
of their liquidity measures on May 2, 2008. Since December
2007, the Fed has conducted fifteen auctions amounting to
US $ 790 billion for 28 days maturity each and an auction of
US $ 20 billion with 35 days maturity up to July 14, 2008. It
has also announced an offer of US $ 75 billion in 28 days credit
through its term auction facility (TAF) on July 28, 2008. In a bid
to ensure continuation of economic growth, the US Treasury
has issued fiscal stimulus payments to American households for
an amount of about US $ 91 billion during April 28-July 11, 2008.
66. Since December 2007, the ECB has conducted thirteen
US dollar TAF auctions amounting to US $ 235 billion up to
July 17, 2008 for 28 days maturity each. The Bank of Canada
(BoC) has conducted nine 28-day auctions amounting to
US $ 16 billion till June 12, 2008. On June 23 and July 8, 2008,
the BoC has stated that it will not renew the term purchase and
resale agreements (PRA) transactions maturing on June 26 and
July 10, 2008. The SNB has conducted ten auctions amounting
to US $ 56 billion for 28 days each up to July 15, 2008. The
Bank of England (BoE) increased liquidity injections from £ 2.85
billion to £ 11.35 billion for its operations in December 2007January 2008 of which £ 10 billion was offered for 3-month
maturity. It also announced that long-term repo operations would
be held against a wider range of high quality collateral. In April
2008, the BoE launched a scheme to allow banks to swap their
high quality mortgage-backed and other securities temporarily
for UK Treasury Bills. The BoE has, up to July 15, 2008 allotted
an amount of £ 54.9 billion for three months’ maturity in six
34

long-term repo auctions since December 2007 against an
extended range of collaterals.
67. The confluence of slowdown in growth and mounting
inflation alongside financial vulnerabilities has complicated the
task of monetary authorities across the world and rendered the
future direction of policy setting highly uncertain. Monetary easing
in the leading developed countries has increased global liquidity
with attendant implications for monetary management in the
emerging economies. Some central banks have cut policy rates
since the third quarter of 2007 when the financial market turmoil
surfaced. During September 18, 2007 to April 30, 2008 the US
Federal Reserve reduced its policy rate by 325 basis points to
2.00 per cent after seventeen increases to 5.25 per cent between
June 2004 and June 2006. The BoE reduced its Bank Rate to
5.0 per cent by 25 basis points each in February and April 2008
but has left it unchanged since then. The BoC reduced its policy
rate to 3.0 per cent by 25 basis points reductions each in
December 2007 and January 2008 and 50 basis points each in
March and April 2008. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand
reduced the Official Cash Rate from 8.25 per cent to 8.0 per cent
on July 24, 2008.
68. Central banks of some countries such as Japan, Korea,
Malaysia and China have not changed their policy rates in 2008.
69. Some central banks that have tightened their policy rates
in recent months include the ECB (main refinancing operations
rate raised by 25 basis points to 4.25 per cent on July 3, 2008);
the Reserve Bank of Australia (Cash Rate raised by 25 basis
points in February-March 2008 to 7.25 per cent); Bank Indonesia
(BI rate raised by 75 basis points in April-June 2008); Bank of
Thailand (1-day repurchase rate raised by 25 basis points to
35

3.50 per cent on July 16, 2008); the Banco Central de Chile
(benchmark lending rate raised to 7.25 per cent by 25 basis
points in January and 50 basis points each in June and
July 2008 from 6.00 per cent in December 2007), Banco Central
do Brasil (overnight Selic rate raised by 125 basis points to
13.00 per cent in June-July 2008) and Banco de Mexico
(inter-bank 1-month rate by 25 basis points each in June-July
2008 to 8.00 per cent).
Overall Assessment
70. Leading indicators of aggregate supply conditions are
emitting mixed signals in an environment of heightened
uncertainty. The outlook for agriculture is generally positive on
the back of the satisfactory progress of the South-West monsoon
across the country so far which has also improved water storage
conditions and enabled a substantial increase in sowing area in
respect of key crops. There are, however, concerns in some
quarters that deficient rainfall received in the monsoon season
so far in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka and Maharashtra
may adversely affect the prospects of crops such as oilseeds,
pulses, cotton and sugarcane. A sizeable step-up in procurement
operations enabled by the record foodgrains production in the
preceding year has been supported by expansion in food credit
extended by banks under a consortium arrangement. Going
forward, the rising level of buffer stocks and prospects for overall
improvement in foodgrains production would assuage supply
shortages, dampen inflation expectations, economise on imports
and fortify food security in the context of the intensifying food
crisis worldwide. In this context, it is worthwhile, however, to
explore the implications of this rapid build-up in buffer stocks,
in particular, the possible unintended consequences of limiting
36

market supplies at a time when demand-supply gaps are strained
and reflected in elevated food prices.
71. Headline industrial growth has moderated and turned
somewhat volatile during September 2007-May 2008 following
a sustained expansion that began in 2003-04 and peaked in
November 2006. In May 2008, however, the growth of industrial
production slowed below consensus expectations across all
constituent sectors, after appearing to have regained some
momentum in April. While production has picked up in some
industries such as beverages and tobacco, chemicals and
transport equipment, and consumer goods production has been
buoyed up by a turnaround in the production of consumer
durables out of a trough in January-March 2008, there appears
to be a slackening of pace in the basic and intermediate goods
segments. The slowing sectors include labour-intensive and
small and medium-scale manufacturing industries such as
textiles, non-metallic mineral products, rubber, plastic and coal
products which together account for about a fourth of
manufacturing activity. Output has declined in respect of food
products and metal products and parts. Capital goods production,
which had held up resiliently so far, weakened in May 2008
and joined other use-based categories in dragging down overall
industrial growth. The continuing slowdown in infrastructure is
impacting the outlook for the industrial sector.
72. Construction activity may be affected in view of the
sluggishness in steel and cement production. More critically, the
sharp deceleration in electricity generation is a cause for concern.
There are indications of moderation in growth in some of the
services sectors, particularly under trade, hotels and restaurants,
transport, construction as well as in some categories of financing,
real estate and business services. Business confidence surveys
37

and purchasing managers' indices are indicating some
moderation in expectations relating to manufacturing and service
sector performance over the months ahead. The recent
slackening of growth in the manufacturing sector, in particular,
warrants a careful and disaggregated analysis to study the
impact of escalated input costs, delays in project implementation
due to lags in public policy clearances and competitive pressures
from imports with a view to designing medium-term strategies
to improve the supply response of India's manufacturing sector
as well as its external competitiveness.
73. Aggregate demand pressures appear to be strongly in
evidence, exacerbated by the slack in the supply response. First,
inflation has surged to a 13-year high and inflation expectations
have been driven up by unrelenting pressures partly emanating
from international commodity prices, particularly crude oil,
oilseeds/edible oils and metals. Second, the sharp escalation of
inflationary pressures has occurred in an environment of high
growth in monetary and banking aggregates which continue to
rule above indicative policy projections for the fourth year in
succession, warranting concern in the context of the monetary
overhang created by large capital inflows in 2006-07 and
particularly in 2007-08. Third, investment demand continues to
be strong, growing in the range of 14-19 per cent since 2002-03
and currently constituting 36 per cent of GDP. Furthermore,
consumption demand appears to be reviving the production of
consumer goods, especially durables. Fourth, with merchandise
imports running ahead of exports, the trade deficit has widened
sizeably in April-May 2008, reflecting the pressure of domestic
demand. There has also been some tightening of external
financing conditions in the ongoing global financial turmoil. Fifth,
there are indications of growing fiscal stress in the volume of
off-budget borrowings by the Centre, impending expenditures
38

on account of food, fertilizer and POL subsidies, the debt waiver
scheme and the award of the Sixth Pay Commission with
consequent pressures on aggregate demand.
74. The upsurge in inflation during the current financial year
reflects a combination of forces at work. First, on a year-on-year
basis, about 30 per cent of headline WPI inflation is contributed
by mineral oils, partly reflecting the pass-through of international
crude prices to domestic administered prices effected on June
5, 2008. In addition, prices of petroleum products which are not
administered have gone up pari passu with international crude
prices, exerting considerable pressure on headline inflation.
Unlike in some developed economies, the pass-through is not
occurring on a continuous basis in developing economies
including India which are tailoring their policy responses to suit
domestic conditions. Second, there are inflationary pressures in
addition to crude oil prices. Even after excluding fuel and food,
WPI inflation has remained close to or higher than the headline
during the year so far. There are also indications that consumer
price inflation is catching up with producer prices so that
inflationary pressures at the retail level appear to be broadening
in their ambit. Prices of manufactured products have contributed
nearly 50 per cent of headline inflation mainly on account of
food products, metal products and chemicals which have been
impacted by the steep rise in input costs, including import prices.
Primary articles have contributed about a fifth of headline
inflation, mainly driven by prices of oilseeds, raw cotton and
milk. Movements in international prices of key commodities
indicate elevated upside pressures for domestic prices of a
number of commodities such as coal, edible oil, rice and steel in
view of the linkages between global and domestic demand-supply
balances, with implications for the evolving scenario.
39

75. There are some signs of moderation in key monetary and
banking aggregates in response to monetary measures which
have withdrawn liquidity from the system and tightened interest
rates across the term structure. The rate of money supply and
deposit growth have started to dip in consonance since June,
edging towards the trajectory set for 2008-09. The balancing of
monetary and liquidity conditions has not, however, impacted the
demand for bank credit which has accelerated on a year-on-year
basis. In particular, food credit has recorded a turnaround to
support the large-scale operations in food procurement by public
agencies. While credit to the petroleum sector has risen sizeably
due to the funding requirements of oil companies in the context
of the escalation in international crude prices, bank credit to
other sectors has also picked up, particularly to infrastructure,
cement, chemicals, transport operators and professional and
other services, reflecting resilient activity in these sectors. On
the other hand, bank credit flowing to agriculture, housing, real
estate, construction, metal products, textiles, gems and jewellery
and engineering has moderated on account of sector-specific
factors which have impacted input costs and impeded the flow
of credit. It is noteworthy that the growth in credit during 2008-09
so far has taken the incremental non-food credit-deposit ratio to
82.4 per cent which appears high given the prescribed
CRR/SLR and banks' preference for holding excess reserves
on a day-to-day basis.
76. Financial markets have generally experienced some
tightening of liquidity conditions and hardening of interest rates,
particularly since the second half of May as monetary measures
took effect. In the money markets, interest rates moved towards
the ceiling of the LAF corridor, rising even beyond in June with
advance tax payments and in the following weeks, albeit within
a narrow range above the repo rate. In the Government
40

securities market, yields have risen across the spectrum on
inflation concerns; with short-term yields responding to monetary
measures, there has been a flattening of the yield curve with
intermittent inversions. In the foreign exchange market, the spot
exchange rate has been under sustained downward pressure
from international crude prices, portfolio outflows and uncertainty
surrounding the outlook. Forward premia have, however, risen
sharply in the recent period as market participants have engaged
in adjustments in their positions in response to the shift in the
underlying trend of the spot market. The credit market has
experienced some tightening in view of banks raising both
deposit and lending rates in response to monetary policy action.
77. Fiscal developments in the early months of 2008-09
indicate some stress on the financial position of the Union
Government. The headline deficit indicators have generally
worsened in April-May 2008 from their levels a year ago. Gross
tax revenues have remained buoyant with direct taxes
constituting 43 per cent, up from their share of 36 per cent in
the first two months of
2007-08. Aggregate plan revenue
expenditure on social and other economic services as well as
grants to States has risen significantly. Capital outlay has also
risen, mainly on account of non-defence spending. In contrast,
the growth of non-plan expenditure has been somewhat muted.
In view of the enhanced outgo on subsidies, interest payments,
farm loan waiver and salaries that is likely to occur over the
coming months, public finances have emerged as a source of
concern from the point of view of macroeconomic management.
78. In the external sector, the growth of both exports and
non-oil imports has moderated in April-May 2008. POL imports,
however, have expanded sizeably on account of elevated
international crude oil prices. A noteworthy development in recent
41

years has been the buoyancy in POL exports, particularly since
2003-04 with growth averaging close to 60 per cent per annum
up to 2007-08. As a result, the POL deficit (POL exports minus
POL imports), which was 118.8 per cent of the overall
merchandise trade deficit in 2003-04, declined to 67.9 per cent
by 2007-08. Net invisibles continue to provide a stable source
of support to the balance of payments. Capital flows are
exhibiting mixed developments. While FDI has more than
doubled, there have been episodes of reversals of portfolio flows
from institutional investors reflecting continuing risk aversion and
concerns about the global slowdown. On the other hand,
issuances of equity and debt instruments by Indian entities in
stock exchanges abroad have picked up. While there has been
some drawdown of the foreign exchange reserves during the
current financial year, external financing conditions continue to
remain viable. The level of reserves is equivalent of more than
a year's imports and exceeds the level of external debt.
79. Downside risks to global economic prospects appear to
have intensified since the Annual Policy Statement of April 2008.
The slowdown of growth seems to be spreading from the US to
several other advanced economies with housing and labour
markets weakening sharply. The deepening financial turbulence
in major financial centres has worsened the macroeconomic
outlook further by erosion of consumer and business sentiment
and tightening of financing conditions with indications that a
generalised credit squeeze may take hold. In the US, the
downturn in the housing sector is contracting residential and
non-residential investment and consumption demand even as
household indebtedness has risen. A positive feature is the
strength of export growth which augurs well for investment in
the tradeable sector. In the UK, economic activity has continued
to slow in 2008 with consumption spending being dragged down
42

by tightening of credit conditions and falling consumer
confidence. The slowing housing sector is also impacting
construction activity. While growth in the euro area has been
somewhat more resilient, business confidence has declined and
private consumption has decelerated along with exports. The
Japanese economy has expanded in the first half of 2008 on
the back of strong exports and relatively robust consumption
and employment growth, although falling residential investment
and deteriorating business sentiment appears to be tempering
domestic demand. Consensus forecasts suggest that the global
economy will slow significantly in 2008 but whether or not it will
avoid a sharp and synchronised downturn is yet unclear.
80. The impact of the slowdown in developed economies on
EMEs cannot but be adverse, but it has so far been limited by
the strength of domestic demand, particularly investment, and
consumption spending has remained stable. The slowing of
import demand from developed economies could, however, pose
a risk to the growth outlook for these economies. Equity markets
in many emerging economies have weakened in 2008 partly on
lower growth expectations. Tightening of financing conditions in
international markets is a growing risk for emerging economies
with current account deficits and relatively large reliance on
cross-border bank borrowing. In particular, terms of trade losses
have impacted the external positions of some emerging
economies that are net commodity importers. The impact of the
global financial turmoil has so far been restricted to portfolio
flows and bank lending to EMEs while foreign direct investment
has remained strong. On the other hand, outward direct
investment from emerging economies, particularly Asia, has
increased significantly. Consensus growth forecasts for EMEs
have declined in recent months but continue to remain
reasonably optimistic about the near term.
43

81. Inflation has emerged as the biggest risk to the global
outlook, having risen to very high levels across the world,
levels that have not been generally seen for a couple of
decades. Developed and emerging economies alike are
reporting multi-year highs in inflation, driven mainly by
escalating commodity prices, particularly of energy, food and
metals. In terms of consumer prices, developed economies are
reporting increases up to 170 basis points since January 2008.
For emerging economies, the increase in inflation has been even
higher i.e., in the range of 120-570 basis points. In terms of
producer prices, inflation is rapidly heading to or is already at
double-digit levels in most developed and emerging economies.
Core measures of inflation and survey-based inflation
expectations have also risen markedly. There are growing
concerns across economies that rising food and energy prices
are triggering a more generalised inflation spiral through
second-round effects. Crude futures do not indicate any let-up
in the current level of prices up to December 2008. Steel prices
have increased in the range of 69-88 per cent in June 2008 on
a year-on-year basis and are set to harden even further. At the
current juncture, globally food prices are likely to remain high at
least up to end-2008, constrained by record low inventories and
restrictions on exports by major foodgrain producers. In several
emerging economies, higher inflation has become associated
with increasing volatility in currency and equity markets as well
as financial sector fragility. By and large, while inflation was
expected to rise, the size of the change in 2008 so far on a
global scale has been clearly unanticipated. Policy responses
have also been constrained in some countries by concerns about
the speed and depth of the slowdown in growth.
82. Developments in the global financial system have
heightened the uncertainty characterising the outlook. While a
44

possible crisis in global finance seems to have been averted,
several vulnerabilities persist in the leading financial centres. The
ultimate size of losses among the largest financial institutions
and the requirement of capital continues to be opaque at this
stage, even as defaults on residential loans appear to be rising,
balance sheets have become extremely sensitive to repricing
and valuation changes and market liquidity remains frozen
despite massive central bank interventions. For the developed
economies affected by the turmoil, balance sheet positions of
corporates as well as those of households - already weakened
by rapid increase in debt and the fall in house prices - have
become increasingly vulnerable to widening spreads and tighter
credit conditions. Banks have been the most severely affected
entities with large write-downs related to mortgage exposures
and a decline in profitability. Investment banking has suffered
from a large decline in profits and near-failure episodes with
the urgent need to infuse substantial amounts of new capital.
Central bank interventions in this context have also been
extraordinary and on a scale not seen since the Great
Depression, demonstrating a resolve to act decisively against
threats to financial stability. With the exception of monoline
insurers, the effect of the financial turmoil on insurance
companies has been less severe than on banks and exposures
are not as wide-spread. In the early months of 2008, hedge
funds, private equity and leveraged buy-outs have experienced
significant pressure and poor performance in a challenging
market environment.
83. Since the end of May 2008, there are incipient signs of
financial markets tending towards some normalcy with financial
institutions being more proactive in disclosing losses,
deleveraging and raising new capital. Spreads have retreated
from their peaks; however, market activity remains somewhat
45

strained. The full truth about the extent of losses and exposures
is not yet known and perceptions of a pronounced increase in
default risk continues to prevail as evident in high credit default
swap (CDS) spreads. Money markets remain dislocated and,
despite central bank liquidity injections alleviating pressures,
uncertainty about future liquidity supply and counterparty risk
persists. Equity markets have dropped sharply in 2008 with the
worsening of the macroeconomic outlook and renewed credit
related concerns. Between April 2008 and July 2008, global
share prices have fallen considerably with an increase in volatility
and a decline in investors' risk tolerance. Bond yields, which
stabilised since mid-March, have started to recover in developed
economies and a flight to safety is leading up to a shortage of
paper. Longer term real yields have declined sharply on
recession fears. In the foreign exchange market, the US dollar
and the pound sterling depreciated in effective terms whereas
the euro, the yen and the Swiss franc appreciated along with
several Asian currencies. Some currencies that had proved to
be resilient in 2007 such as the Canadian dollar, the Korean
won and the South African rand have depreciated, in some cases
substantially, in 2008 so far. Concerns about a more widespread
slowdown, rising inflation and perceptions of overvaluation have
been weighing on emerging market asset classes in 2008 with
spreads on sovereign debt widening.
84. In the overall assessment, several risks looming over the
global economy at the time of the Annual Policy Statement of
April 2008 have either materialised or intensified with implications
for every national economy, including India. The outlook is highly
unclear and the prospects of resolution of the multiple
disequilibria embedded in global developments are fraught with
uncertainty. Although the IMF has revised its forecast of global
growth for 2008 up by 0.4 percentage points in July over its
46

April projection, the consensus now appears to be that the
slowdown of growth is deepening and broader in its span than
initially expected with more significant slowing likely in the period
ahead. In view of the international linkages that are stronger
now than before, macroeconomic prospects for the EMEs, that
have so far remained relatively unscathed, are overcast with
downside risks from knock-on and lagged effects of the
downturn. Globally, inflation pressures brought on by the elevated
levels of crude, metal and some food prices show no signs of
abating and instead, appear to be getting entrenched into
inflation expectations. While high inflation is now a worldwide
phenomenon, country responses have differed widely depending
on perceptions of the nature of the shock, how long it will last
and the stage of the inflation cycle in terms of the onset of the
second-order impact. In some developed countries, the policy
response to inflation has been proscribed by relatively
overarching concerns for financial stability in the context of the
ongoing financial turmoil. While vestiges of calm appear to have
been restored in financial markets by end-June, the dangers of
further deepening of the crisis and potential contagion have, in
fact, increased. In emerging economies like India, these effects
are already in evidence in the currency and equity markets and
phases of capital outflows have occurred from some of these
countries. Accordingly, heightened vigilance and stress testing
of the preparedness to deal with these developments assumes
critical importance as recent weeks have shown.
85. Domestically, some moderation appears to be underway
with slower momentum in industrial and service sector activity,
while the outlook for agriculture provides a silver lining in terms
of food availability and the mitigating effect on inflation
expectations. Nevertheless, inflation risks have increased sharply
and appear to be persistent at this juncture. The conduct of
47

monetary policy in the context of bringing down inflationary
pressures and anchoring inflation expectations is, however,
complicated by global developments and domestic demand
pressures.

II. Stance of Monetary Policy for the
Remaining Period of 2008-09
86. The Annual Policy Statement of April 2008 had indicated
concerns that threats to growth and stability from global
developments had increased considerably with a highly uncertain
likelihood of early resolution. However, it was stated that
domestic factors would continue to dominate the policy setting,
with a contextual emphasis on inflation expectations. Accordingly,
the overall stance of monetary policy in 2008-09 was set in
terms of ensuring a monetary and interest rate environment that
accords high priority to price stability, well-anchored inflation
expectations and orderly conditions in financial markets while
being conducive to continuation of the growth momentum with
due emphasis on credit quality and credit delivery. It was
resolved to respond swiftly on a continuing basis to the evolving
constellation of adverse international developments and to the
domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations, financial
stability and growth momentum, with both conventional and
unconventional measures, as appropriate. Liquidity management
was accorded priority in the context of underlying monetary and
financial developments.
87. In the subsequent period, active liquidity management
assumed critical importance in view of persistent surplus
conditions in financial markets coinciding with an upsurge in
inflation. Accordingly, the CRR was raised on April 17, 2008 by
48

25 basis points each from the fortnights beginning April 26 and
May 10, 2008. Subsequently, another increase of 25 basis points
in the CRR effective from May 24, 2008 was announced in the
Annual Policy Statement. On May 30, 2008 special market
operations were announced to alleviate the binding financing
constraints faced by public oil companies in importing POL as
also to minimise the potential adverse consequences for financial
markets in which these oil companies are important participants.
Subsequent to the announcement of the hike in administered
POL prices, the repo rate was increased by 25 basis points on
June 11, 2008. Furthermore, on June 24, the repo rate was
increased by 50 basis points and the CRR was increased by
25 basis points each from the fortnights beginning July 5 and
July 19. These measures, along with the calibrated and
graduated withdrawal of monetary accommodation undertaken
since September 2004, impart a stabilising influence on the
economy in the period ahead. In view of the criticality of
anchoring inflation expectations, a continuous heightened vigil
over ensuing monetary and macroeconomic developments is
maintained to enable swift responses with appropriate measures
as necessary, consistent with the monetary policy stance.
88. Monsoon conditions have, by and large, been favourable
so far in large parts of the country barring deficient/scanty rainfall
in some regions that could affect the prospects of some crops.
Nevertheless, in the absence of unanticipated weather
adversities, moisture conditions should support a continuation
of the above medium-term trend growth in agriculture. On the
other hand, there is more than originally anticipated moderation
in activity in the industrial and in some services sectors. Such a
moderation could persist in the short-term, notwithstanding the
still robust underlying momentum in these sectors. Furthermore,
world GDP growth is projected by the IMF to undergo a
49

pronounced slowdown in the second half of the year and is
expected to decelerate by close to one percentage point in relation
to 2007 with second round effects on world trade growth. Overall,
taking into account aggregate demand management and supply
prospects described above, the projection of real GDP growth of
the Indian economy in 2008-09 in the range of 8.0 to 8.5 per cent
as set out in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2008 may prove
to be optimistic and hence for policy purposes, a projection of
around 8.0 per cent appears a more realistic central scenario at
this juncture, barring domestic or external shocks.
89. Bringing down inflation from the current high levels and
stabilising inflation expectations assumes the highest priority in
the stance of monetary policy. Currently, pressures from global
inflation developments emanate from prices of some food articles,
crude oil and other commodities such as metals. As regards
food prices, there are indications of improvement in crop
conditions in some of the major foodgrains producing countries.
For the Indian economy, monsoon conditions augur well for an
expansion of the domestic supply response, particularly in
respect of key foodgrains. In this context, domestic food prices
may soften in the months ahead as these positive developments
take hold. International crude prices remain at elevated levels
with no clear indication of any tendency towards assured
moderation, despite some incipient softening in recent weeks.
There is, however, a view that slowdown in global activity may
moderate demand and speculative elements. Accordingly, there
is a possibility, albeit remote, of a drastic reduction in the level
of crude prices in the period ahead. In the event, however
unlikely, of international crude prices falling below the level up
to which pass-through to domestic POL prices in India has
occurred, there could be some easing of domestic inflation. There
is also a view that international prices of other commodities
50

including metals could also moderate with the slowing down of
aggregate demand globally. While such moderation in some
global commodity prices in future cannot be ruled out, it is
prudent to assume that in all likelihood, the current elevated
levels will continue in the near future with added uncertainties.
90. The Annual Policy Statement of April 2008 stated that, in
view of the lagged and cumulative effects of monetary policy
on aggregate demand and assuming that supply management
would be conducive, capital flows would be managed actively
and in the absence of new adversities emanating in the domestic
or global economy, the policy endeavour would be to bring down
inflation from the current high to around 5.0 to 5.5 per cent in
2008-09 with a preference for bringing it as close to 5.0 per cent
as soon as possible, recognising the evolving complexities in
globally transmitted inflation. The Annual Policy Statement added
that the resolve, going forward, would continue to be to condition
policy and perceptions for inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent
so that an inflation rate of around 3.0 per cent becomes a
medium-term objective consistent with India's broader
integration into the global economy and with the goal of
maintaining self-accelerating growth over the medium-term.
Recent developments, global as well as domestic, on both
supply and demand sides described in this Policy Review,
however, point to accentuation of inflationary pressures,
especially in terms of inflation expectations and perceptions
during the first quarter of 2008-09.
91. Over the last 12 months, the escalation in inflation has
become a global phenomenon and the increase in inflation in
India over the previous year is not proportionately different from
elsewhere. Looking forward, the global and more importantly,
the domestic factors pose severe challenges to monetary
51

management and warrant reinforced policy actions on several
fronts. Against this background, it is expected that inflation would
moderate from the current high levels in the months to come
and a noticeable decline in inflation can be expected towards
the last quarter of 2008-09. Accordingly, while the policy actions
would aim to bring down the current intolerable level of inflation
to a tolerable level of below 5.0 per cent as soon as possible
and around 3.0 per cent over the medium-term, at this juncture
a realistic policy endeavour would be to bring down inflation
from the current level of about 11.0-12.0 per cent to a level
close to 7.0 per cent by March 31, 2009.
92. As indicated in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2008,
the sustained expansion of money supply above indicative
projections since 2005-06 has resulted in a sizeable monetary
overhang which warrants continuous policy monitoring in view
of the implications for fighting inflation at the current juncture
and over the medium term as the lagged and cumulative effects
of monetary policy actions work their way through the economy.
Accordingly, it is necessary to moderate monetary expansion
and plan for a rate of money supply growth in the range of
around 17.0 per cent in 2008-09 in consonance with the outlook
on growth and inflation so as to ensure macroeconomic and
financial stability in the period ahead. Consistent with the
projection of money supply, the growth in aggregate deposits in
2008-09 is now placed at around 17.5 per cent or around
Rs.6,00,000 crore. Based on an overall assessment of the
sources of funding and the overall credit requirements of
the various productive sectors of the economy, the growth
of non-food credit including investments in bonds/debentures/
shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sector
and CP is placed at around 20.0 per cent in 2008-09, as
indicated in the Annual Policy Statement, consistent with the
52

monetary projections. While there are early signs of some
moderation in money supply and deposit growth, they continue
to expand above the indicative projections warranting continuous
vigilance and appropriate and timely policy responses.
93. Active management of liquidity conditions through the
flexible use of policy instruments has, to a significant extent,
insulated domestic financial markets from the turmoil in major
financial centres in developed economies. These liquidity
management operations have generally absorbed excessive
market pressures and enabled orderly conditions. In view of the
evolving environment of heightened uncertainty, volatility in global
markets and the dangers of potential spillovers to domestic equity
and currency markets, liquidity management will continue to
receive priority in the hierarchy of policy objectives over the
period ahead. In particular, volatility in capital flows and cash
balances of the Government will continue to necessitate active
liquidity management with a combination of instruments as
warranted. In this context, it is necessary to note that there is
headroom with the Reserve Bank in terms of the flexibility in
the deployment of instruments, complemented by prudential
regulations and instruments for capital account management.
94. Since April 2005, the Reserve Bank has been expressing
concerns about strong credit growth, the significantly overdrawn
state of the banking system to sustain the credit disbursement,
mismatches between sources and uses of funds and implications
for interest rates, liquidity conditions and credit quality. Several
monetary and prudential measures have been undertaken in this
period and banks have been sensitised in this regard. While
there has been some rebalancing and overall correction during
2007-08 in response to policy initiatives, in 2008-09 so far,
however, some banks have expanded credit rapidly in relation
53

to the system level growth, with attendant worsening of their
credit-deposit ratios. These developments warrant heightened
policy concerns in the interest of overall systemic stability and
the quality of financial intermediation. In this context, banks are
urged to review their business strategies so that they are in a
position to combine longer term viable financing with profitability
in operations, recognising the reality of business cycles and
countercyclical monetary policy responses. A key aspect of this
review should be a renewed emphasis on credit quality while
simultaneously pursuing greater credit penetration and financial
inclusion. Banks should focus on stricter credit appraisals on a
sectoral basis, monitor loan to value ratios and generally ensure
the health of credit portfolios on a durable basis without
encountering undue asset-liability mismatches. If necessary, the
Reserve Bank would consider undertaking supervisory review
of those select banks which are over extended in terms of their
credit portfolios relative to their sources of funds.
95. The impact of the escalation in international food, crude
and other commodity prices is already being reflected in a
sizeable expansion in the merchandise trade deficit and
persisting downward pressures in the foreign exchange market.
Furthermore, capital flows have exhibited some volatility with
episodes of portfolio outflows and tightening of international bank
lending. Overall, the merchandise trade deficit is expected to
be somewhat higher and the current account deficit marginally
higher in 2008-09 than in the preceding year. It is, however,
expected that net capital flows would meet the external financing
requirement in 2008-09.
96. Early fiscal indicators point to some strains on the Centre's
fiscal position which has worsened somewhat in relation to
54

budget estimates. In view of growing off-budget liabilities and
enhanced expenditures on subsidies, loan waivers and salaries
in the rest of the year, fiscal developments warrant close and
careful monitoring in view of the configuration of risks both
domestically and globally, and, in particular, the implications for
inflation and external sector management. The evolving fiscal
conditions in an atmosphere of persistent inflationary pressures
pose severe challenges to monetary management, especially if
supply inelasticities continue to prevail in the short-term.
97. As stated in the press release announcing monetary
measures on June 24, 2008 and increasingly relevant at this
juncture, the overriding priority for monetary policy is to eschew
any further intensification of inflationary pressures and to firmly
anchor inflation expectations. In this regard, monetary policy has
to urgently address aggregate demand pressures which appear
to be strongly in evidence. The Reserve Bank's approach in
this regard is in a calm and calculated fashion avoiding
exaggerated bearishness and on an ongoing basis, in a timely
manner and conscious of strengths and challenges in this
context. This measured monetary policy response has moderated
early signs of overheating that emerged in 2006-07 and would
continue to work in conjunction with supply-side measures to
bring down inflation to more acceptable levels on an urgent basis
by building on actions already taken. Therefore, it is important
to recognise that in an environment of limited supply elasticities
in the short run, an adjustment of overall aggregate demand on
an economy-wide basis is warranted to ensure that generalised
instability does not develop and erode the hard-earned gains in
terms of both outcomes of and positive sentiments on India's
growth momentum. In this specific context, the Reserve Bank's
55

effort is to smoothen and enable this adjustment so that inflation
expectations are contained.
98. Global growth has decelerated in the first quarter of 2008
and is expected to slow down further over the rest of the year
as indicated in the waning business and consumer confidence
and weak industrial activity. There are also indications that the
slowdown is becoming more broad-based in advanced
economies and incipiently in emerging economies as well.
Threats to financial stability also continue to rule at elevated
levels with possible feedback into the prospects for
macroeconomic performance. Inflation pressures are likely to
intensify further in both advanced and emerging economies,
driven by the relentless rise in food and fuel prices and tightening
supply constraints. Slower growth in demand may temper
commodity prices and ultimately inflationary pressures; however,
the manner and period over which this adjustment would take
place is highly uncertain. Increasingly, it is felt that a multilateral
effort is needed to ameliorate the social and economic deprivation
associated with this shock, improve the supply-demand balance
in commodity markets and fortify the national macroeconomic
policy responses.
99. These global developments have implications for India's
macroeconomic outlook with sharp challenges and dilemmas
confronting the setting of monetary policy. First, it is necessary
to recognise the global dimensions of the crisis which is
threatening the credibility of monetary policy worldwide. Second,
monetary policy has to deal with the structural components
embedded in the drivers of inflation which, unlike cyclical
elements, are somewhat impervious in the short run to
instruments of aggregate demand management. Third, while
56

modulation of aggregate demand assumes crucial importance,
it is also necessary to nurture and consolidate the recent gains
in augmenting supply capacities and improvements in productivity
and efficiency which accrue over a longer term horizon. Fourth,
even though concerns about the financial crisis deepening have
retreated in recent weeks, financial markets are still fragile and
impairment to balance sheets of financial institutions and credit
conditions has increased the vulnerability to financial instability,
further complicating the conduct of monetary policy. Against this
backdrop, it is essential to stabilise and anchor inflation
expectations as soon as feasible.
100. Accordingly, as stated in the Annual Policy Statement of
April 2008, it is critical at this juncture to demonstrate on a
continuing basis a determination to act decisively, effectively and
swiftly to curb any signs of adverse developments in regard to
inflation expectations. In view of the above unprecedented
uncertainties and dilemmas, it is important to take informed
judgements with regard to the timing and magnitude of policy
actions; and such judgements need to have the benefit of
evaluation of incoming information on a continuous basis.
101. The Reserve Bank will continue with its policy of active
demand management of liquidity through appropriate use of the
CRR stipulations and open market operations (OMO) including
the MSS and the LAF, using all the policy instruments at its
disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants.
102. In sum, barring the emergence of any adverse and
unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy,
assuming that capital flows are effectively managed, and keeping
in view the current assessment of the economy including the
57

outlook for growth and inflation, the overall stance of monetary
policy in 2008-09 will broadly continue to be:
●

●

●

To ensure a monetary and interest rate environment
that accords high priority to price stability, well-anchored
inflation expectations and orderly conditions in financial
markets while being conducive to continuation of the
growth momentum.
To respond swiftly on a continuing basis to the evolving
constellation of adverse international developments and
to the domestic situation impinging on inflation
expectations, financial stability and growth momentum,
with both conventional and unconventional measures,
as appropriate.
To emphasise credit quality as well as credit delivery,
in particular, for employment-intensive sectors, while
pursuing financial inclusion.

III. Monetary Measures
(a)

Bank Rate

103. The Bank Rate has been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent.
(b)

Repo Rate/Reverse Repo Rate

104. It is considered desirable to keep the reverse repo rate
under the LAF unchanged at 6.0 per cent.
105. In view of the current macroeconomic and overall
monetary conditions, it has been decided to increase the fixed
repo rate under the LAF by 50 basis points from 8.5 per cent
to 9.0 per cent with immediate effect.
106. The Reserve Bank has the flexibility to conduct repo/
reverse repo auctions at a fixed rate or at variable rates as
circumstances warrant.
107. The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight
or longer term repo/reverse repo under the LAF depending on
market conditions and other relevant factors. The Reserve Bank
will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or
reject tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit,
so as to make efficient use of the LAF in daily liquidity
management.
(c)

Cash Reserve Ratio

108. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks is
currently at 8.75 per cent. On a review of the current liquidity
situation, it is considered desirable to increase the CRR by 25
basis points to 9.0 per cent with effect from the fortnight
beginning August 30, 2008.
59

Mid-Term Review
109. The Mid-Term Review of the Annual Policy Statement for
the year 2008-09 will be announced on October 24, 2008.
