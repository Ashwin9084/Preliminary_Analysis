Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2010-11
By
Dr. D. Subbarao
Governor
Introduction
There have been significant
changes in the macroeconomic
environment since the Second Quarter
Review issued on November 2, 2010.
Globally, the recovery in the advanced
economies appears to be consolidating
and expectations of growth during
2011, particularly in the US, are
generally being revised upwards.
However,
inflationary
tendencies
are clearly visible. Though still
subdued in the advanced economies,
inflationary pressures in emerging
market economies (EMEs), which were
already strong, have intensified due to
sharp increases in food, energy and
commodity prices.
2.
The Indian economy has reverted
to its pre-crisis growth trajectory, with
growth in the first half of 2010-11
estimated at 8.9 per cent. Recent data on
agricultural output and service sector
indicators suggest that the growth
momentum continued in the third
quarter. The robustness of growth is also
reflected in corporate sales, tax revenues
and bank credit, notwithstanding some
moderation in the index of industrial
production (IIP).

3.
Inflation is clearly the dominant
concern. Even as the rate itself remains
uncomfortably high, the reversal in the
direction of inflation is striking. After
some moderation between August and
November 2010, inflation rose again in
December 2010 on the back of sharp
increase in the prices of primary food
articles and the recent spurt in global
oil prices. Non-food manufacturing
inflation has remained sticky, reflecting
both buoyant demand conditions and
rising costs.
4.
Against this backdrop, this
statement sets out the Reserve
Bank’s assessment of the current
macroeconomic situation and forward
projections. It is organised in four
sections. Section I provides an overview
of global and domestic macroeconomic
developments. Section II sets out the
outlook and projections for growth,
inflation and monetary aggregates.
Section III explains the stance of
monetary policy. Section IV specifies
the policy measures. This statement
should be read and understood
together with the detailed review
in Macroeconomic and Monetary
Developments released yesterday by the
Reserve Bank.

I. The State of the Economy
The Global Economy
5.
Global growth prospects have
improved in recent weeks. The recovery
in major advanced economies, which had
weakened during Q2 of 2010, regained
strength in Q3 of 2010. Real GDP growth
in the US, which had moderated from
3.7 per cent in Q1 of 2010 to 1.7 per cent
in Q2 of 2010, improved to 2.6 per cent
in Q3. Corporate capital spending and
retail sales in the US have improved.
While uncertainty persists in the Euro
area and Japan, the baseline outlook for
both is improving. Growth in EMEs has
remained strong, supported largely by
domestic demand.
6.
In advanced economies, the
earlier fears of deflation have given way
to early signs of inflation. In EMEs,
inflation has accentuated significantly
in the recent period. Rapidly rising
food prices in several economies such
as China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and
Russia are a major contributory factor.
According to the Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO), international food
prices rose by 25 per cent in December
2010 in comparison with the level at the
end of 2009. The increase in global food
prices has been led by prices of edible
oils (55 per cent), cereals (39 per cent)
and sugar (19 per cent). Significantly,
the FAO expects food prices to further
harden during 2011, intensifying global
inflationary pressures.
7.
These pressures are likely to
be reinforced by trends in energy and
commodity prices. The crude oil (Brent)
price perked from US$ 85 per barrel on
November 2, 2010 to US$ 97 per barrel
on January 21, 2011. The price of crude
(ICE Brent) in the futures market is
2

ruling at US$ 98 per barrel for March
2011 delivery. Many other commodities
have seen similar movements. As
growth prospects in the US improve, the
consequent increase in global demand
for energy and commodities will exert
further pressure on prices. Already,
the 10-year benchmark US government
securities yield increased from 2.4
per cent in early October 2010 to 3.4 per
cent in mid-January 2011, indicating,
among other things, rising inflationary
expectations.
The Domestic Economy
8.
Real GDP in India increased
by 8.9 per cent during the first half of
2010-11, reflecting strong domestic
demand, especially private consumption
and investment, and improving external
demand. Although on a cumulative
basis, the IIP grew by 9.5 per cent during
April-November 2010, it has been
volatile in the current financial year
with growth rates ranging between 2.7
per cent and 16.6 per cent. Overall,
robust corporate sales, large indirect
tax collections, advance tax payments
and leading indicators of service sector
activity suggest persistence of the
growth momentum.
9.
On the other hand, the latest
quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey
conducted by the Reserve Bank
during
October-December
2010
indicates a marginal moderation in
overall business expectations during
January-March 2011 from their high
level in the previous quarter. The
Reserve Bank’s order book, inventories
and capacity utilisation survey for
July-September 2010 showed a marginal

improvement in capacity utilisation
in Q2 of 2010-11, while the HSBC
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)
showed some moderation in the pace
of manufacturing sector expansion in
December 2010.
10.
Headline inflation, based on
year-on-year changes in the wholesale
price index (WPI), moderated to a
single digit in August 2010 and softened
further to 7.5 per cent in November 2010,
the lowest level attained during 2010.
However, inflation reversed course to rise
to 8.4 per cent in December 2010, driven
primarily by food and fuel inflation.
11.
Year-on-year primary food
articles inflation spiked to 13.5
per cent in December from 9.4
per cent in November due to severe
supply constraints in respect of
some food items. In particular,
vegetable prices increased by 22.9
per cent in December 2010 over the
previous month’s level. Month-onmonth price increases were very high
for some vegetables such as brinjals
(65 per cent), onions (35 per cent), garlic
(26 per cent), cabbage (22 per cent),
tomatoes (19 per cent) and potatoes
(16 per cent).
12.
Year-on-year fuel inflation, which
had moderated from 14.4 per cent in May
2010 to 10.3 per cent in November 2010,
rose again to 11.2 per cent in December
2010 due to a rise in non-administered
domestic fuel prices, reflecting the sharp
increase in international prices. In the first
fortnight of January 2011, oil marketing
companies further raised the prices of
petroleum products (petrol and aviation
turbine fuel) which will further add to
fuel inflation. The year-on-year WPI
non-food manufactured products (weight:
3

55 per cent) inflation, which moderated
from 5.9 per cent in April 2010 to
5.1 per cent in September 2010,
increased to 5.4 per cent in November,
though it softened marginally to 5.3
per cent in December. Significantly,
non-food manufactured products inflation
continues to remain above its mediumterm trend of 4.0 per cent. Moreover, in
recent months, the underlying inflation
momentum in this segment has been
positive.
13.
Between
November
and
December 2010, as WPI inflation
moved up from 7.5 per cent (year-onyear) to 8.4 per cent, the wholesale
price index increased by 1.3 per cent.
Of this increase in index, 82 per cent
was contributed by primary articles
and fuel groups and 18 per cent by
the manufactured products group.
At a disaggregated level, vegetables
alone contributed as much as 40 per
cent to the increase in the index in
December, followed by mineral oil
(13 per cent), condiment and spices
(8 per cent) and minerals (7 per cent).
14.
Money supply (M3) growth
moderated during the year, reflecting
slower deposit growth and faster
currency expansion which reduced
the money multiplier. Several banks
raised their deposit rates after the
Second Quarter Review of 2010-11
which contributed to a larger deposit
mobilisation in December. Consequently,
M3 growth increased to 16.5 per cent by
end-December 2010, close to the indicative
projection of 17 per cent for 2010-11.
15.
However, year-on-year nonfood credit growth has been above the
Reserve Bank’s indicative projection of
20 per cent since early October 2010,

rising to 24 per cent by end-December
2010. The wide gap between credit
growth and deposit growth resulted
in a sharp increase in the incremental
non-food credit-deposit ratio to 102 per
cent by end-December 2010, up from 58
per cent in the corresponding period of
previous year.
16.
Disaggregated data suggest that
credit growth, which was earlier driven
by the infrastructure sector, is becoming
increasingly broad-based across sectors
and industries, evidencing growth
momentum and demand pressures.
Credit flow to the services sector
increased significantly for transport
operators, tourism, hotel and restaurant
and commercial real estate, besides retail
housing and personal loans. As regards
industry, apart from infrastructure,
increase in credit was significant for
metals, engineering, textiles, food
processing and chemical and chemical
products.
17.
Rough estimates showed that the
total flow of fi nancial resources from
banks and non-banks to the commercial
sector during April-December 2010
was `9,01,000 crore, up from `6,36,000
crore during the corresponding period
of last year. While bank credit to the
commercial sector surged, the flow of
funds from other sources was lower
than last year’s level mainly on account
of lower net inflows from foreign direct
investment (FDI).
18.
As part of the calibrated exit from
the crisis driven expansionary monetary
stance, the Reserve Bank increased the
repo rate by 150 basis points (bps) and
the reverse repo rate by 200 bps during
March–November 2010. In addition, the
cash reserve ratio (CRR) was raised by
100 bps. In response to these monetary
4

policy measures, scheduled commercial
banks (SCBs) raised their deposit
rates in the range of 25-250 bps during
March 2010-January 2011 across various
maturities, indicating strong monetary
policy transmission.
19.
The Base Rate system replaced
the Benchmark Prime Lending Rate
system with effect from July 1, 2010.
Several banks reviewed and increased
their Base Rates by 25-100 bps between
July 2010 and January 2011. Base Rates
of 67 banks with a share of 98 per cent
in the total bank credit were in the range
of 7.5-9.0 per cent in December 2010.
20.
Tight
liquidity
conditions
persisted throughout the third quarter
of 2010-11. The average daily net
injection of liquidity through the
liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)
increased from around `62,000 crore
in October to around `99,000 crore
in November and further to around
`1,20,000 crore in December, with the
peak injection of around `1,71,000 crore
on December 22, 2010. While the overall
liquidity in the system has remained
in deficit consistent with the policy
stance, the extent of tightness after the
Second Quarter Review of 2010-11 was
outside the comfort zone of the Reserve
Bank, i.e., (+)/(-) one per cent of net
demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of
banks. Above-normal government cash
balances, which rose from an average of
`73,000 crore in October to `1,53,000
crore by the second half of December
2010, contributed to the frictional
component of liquidity deficit. However,
the widening difference between credit
and deposit growth rates coupled with
high currency growth accentuated the
structural liquidity deficit.

21.
The Reserve Bank instituted
a number of measures to mitigate the
liquidity deficit. First, the statutory
liquidity ratio (SLR) of SCBs was
reduced from 25 per cent of their
NDTL to 24 per cent with effect from
December 18, 2010. Second, it conducted
open market operation (OMO) purchase
of government securities of the order
of over `67,000 crore. Third, additional
liquidity support to SCBs was provided
under the LAF. This facility, which was
initially available up to 2 per cent of
their NDTL, was brought down to one
per cent of NDTL after reduction in the
SLR by one percentage point. Fourth, a
second LAF window was introduced.
22.
Government spending resulted
in a reduction of its cash balances
during January 2011 (up to January
21, 2011). As a result, the average daily
net liquidity injection through the
LAF declined from around `1,20,000
crore during December 2010 to around
`90,000 crore in January 2011 (up to
January 21, 2011).
23.
Reflecting the improvement
in the tight liquidity conditions, the
average daily call rate moderated
from 6.7 per cent during December
2010 to 6.5 per cent in January 2011
(up to January 21, 2011). At the longer
end, 10-year government security
(G-Sec) yield, which had generally
remained above 8 per cent during
most of October-November 2010 on
account of inflationary pressures
and persistent liquidity tightness,
also softened in the second half of
December 2010. However, the yield
on 10-year G-sec moved up again
5

to 8.2 per cent by January 21, 2011,
reflecting both liquidity conditions and
inflationary expectations.
24.
Over 95 per cent of the Central
Government’s budgeted borrowing
programme (net) was completed by
January 24, 2011. During the fi rst eight
months of 2010-11, the fiscal deficit of
the Central Government was less than
50 per cent of the budget estimates.
The one-off revenue generated from
spectrum auctions, estimated to be
around 1.5 per cent of GDP for the year,
has been a major contributor to the
current improvement on the revenue
side.
25.
During
2010-11
(up
to
December 2010), the real exchange
rate of the rupee showed a mixed
trend. It appreciated by 3.7 per cent on
the basis of the trade based 6-currency
real effective exchange rate (REER),
reflecting both nominal appreciation
of the rupee against the US dollar
and the higher inflation differential
with major advanced countries.
However, against broader baskets of
36-currency and 30-currency REER,
the rupee depreciated over its March
2010 levels by 0.6 per cent and 2.5
per cent, respectively.
26.
On a balance of payments (BoP)
basis, the trade deficit widened to US$
35.4 billion in Q2 of 2010-11 from
US$ 31.6 billion in Q1. Coupled with
stagnation in invisibles receipts, this
led to a widening of the current account
deficit (CAD) from US$ 12.1 billion in
Q1 of 2010-11 to US$ 15.8 billion in
Q2 of 2010-11. In the fi rst half
of 2010-11, the CAD expanded to 3.7

per cent of GDP from 2.2 per cent in
the corresponding period of last year.
Subsequent trade data indicate faster
growth in exports vis-a-vis imports
which may help improve the CAD in
Q3 of 2010-11. However, the sharp

increase in global commodity prices,
particularly oil, could have an adverse
impact on our trade balance going
forward. For the year as a whole, India’s
CAD is expected to be close to 3.5
per cent of GDP.

II. Outlook and Projections
Global Outlook
Growth
27.
With
advanced
economies
showing fi rmer signs of sustainable
recovery, global growth in 2010 is
expected to have been less imbalanced
than before. While growth in advanced
economies may improve, growth in
EMEs, which have been the main
engine of global economic growth in
the recent period, may moderate due
to tightening of monetary policy to
address rising inflationary concerns
and the waning impact of the fiscal
stimulus measures taken in the wake
of the global fi nancial crisis.
Inflation
28.
Even as a large slack persists,
inflation has edged up in major advanced
economies owing mainly to increase
in food and energy prices. Inflation in
the Euro area exceeded the European
Central Bank’s (ECB) medium-term
target for the fi rst time in more than
two years in December 2010. Similarly
in the UK, the headline inflation has
persisted above the target of the Bank
of England. In the US, the headline
CPI rose to 1.5 per cent in December
2010 from 1.1 per cent in November
2010. Whereas signs of inflation in the
advanced countries are only incipient,
6

many EMEs have been facing strong
inflationary pressures, reflecting higher
international commodity prices and
rising domestic demand pressures.
29.
Significantly, food, energy and
commodity prices are widely expected
to harden during 2011, driven by a
combination of supply constraints and
rising global demand, as the advanced
economies consolidate their recovery.
This suggests that inflation could be a
global concern in 2011.
Domestic Outlook
Growth
30.
On the domestic front, the 8.9
per cent GDP growth in the fi rst half of
2010-11 suggests that the economy is
operating close to its trend growth rate,
powered mainly by domestic factors.
The kharif harvest has been good and
rabi prospects look promising. Good
agricultural growth has boosted rural
demand. Export performance in recent
months has been encouraging.
31.
With the risks to growth in
2010-11 being mainly on the upside, the
baseline projection of real GDP growth
is retained at 8.5 per cent as set out in
the Second Quarter Review of Monetary
Policy of July 2010 but with an upside
bias (Chart 1).

Inflation
32.
The moderation in headline
inflation observed between August and
November 2010 was along the projected
trajectory of the Reserve Bank. This
trend, however, reversed in December
2010 due mainly to sharp increase in
the prices of vegetables, mineral oils
and minerals.
33.
While the current spike in food
prices is expected to be transitory,
structural demand-supply mismatches
in several non-cereal food items such as
pulses, oilseeds, eggs, fish and meat and
milk are likely to keep food inflation
high. Non-food manufacturing inflation
also remains significantly above its
medium-term trend of 4 per cent. The
Reserve Bank’s quarterly inflation
expectations survey, conducted during
the first fortnight of December 2010,
indicates that expectations of households
remain elevated.
34.
Going forward, the inflation
outlook will be shaped by the following
factors. First, it will depend on how the
food price situation – both domestic
and global – evolves. Domestic food
price inflation has witnessed high

CI - Confidence Interval

volatility since mid-2009 due to both
structural and transitory factors. A
significant part of the recent increase in
food price inflation is due to structural
constraints. This is reflected in the less
than expected moderation in food price
inflation even in a normal monsoon year.
There has also been a sharp increase in
the prices of some food items due to
transitory supply shocks. What is more
worrying is the substantial increase in
prices of several food items even though
their production has not been affected.
As a result, the usual moderation in
vegetable prices in the winter season
has not materialised.
35.
Notably, high food price inflation
is not unique to India. Food prices have
spiked in many countries in the recent
period. India is a large importer of
certain food items such as edible oils,
and the domestic food price situation
could be exacerbated by the increase
in global food prices. This, therefore,
poses an additional risk to domestic
food price inflation.
36.
The second factor that will
shape the inflation outlook is how
global commodity prices behave.

Prices of some commodities rose
sharply in the recent period even as
the global recovery was fragile. Should
these trends continue, they will impact
inflation, domestically and globally.
37.
The third factor is the extent
to which demand side pressures may
manifest. This risk arises from three
sources, viz., the spill-over of rising
food inflation; rising input costs,
particularly industrial raw materials
and oil; and pressure on wages, both
in the formal and informal sectors.
The rise in food inflation has not only
persisted for more than two years now,
the increase has been rather sharp in
the recent period. This cannot but have
some spill-over effects on generalised
inflation, particularly when the growth
momentum is strong and both workers
and producers are likely to have pricing
power. There are indications that,
in the corporate sector, the share of
wages in total costs is increasing. The
indexation of the Mahatma Gandhi
National Rural Employment Guarantee
Act (MGNREGA) wages will also raise
the wage rate in the agricultural sector.
Further, besides oil, the prices of some

primary non-food articles have risen
sharply in the recent period. Since these
are inputs into manufactured products,
the risk to headline inflation is not only
from the increase in non-food items but
also because the increase in input costs
will ultimately impact output prices. As
the output gap closes, corporates will
also be able to sustain higher output
prices. In the absence of commensurate
increase in capacity, there is the risk of
demand side pressures accentuating.
38.
In the Second Quarter Review
of November 2010, the Reserve
Bank set out the baseline projection
of WPI inflation for March 2011 at
5.5 per cent, based on the new
WPI series (2004-05=100). The MidQuarter Review of December 2010
indicated that the risks to inflation going
forward were largely on the upside.
Some of these risks have materialised
as reflected in the increase in the prices
of metals and non-administered fuel.
There have also been some transitory
supply shocks as reflected in the sharp
increase in vegetable prices. In addition,
petroleum and aviation turbine fuel
prices were raised in early January
which will add 9 bps to WPI inflation.

While the impact of transitory factors is
expected to wane, the price pressures on
account of demand-supply imbalances
in respect of some commodities will
persist. Considering the increase that
has already occurred and the emerging
domestic and external scenario, the
baseline projection of WPI inflation
for March 2011 is revised upwards to
7.0 per cent from 5.5 per cent
(Chart 2).
Monetary Aggregates
39.
While the year-on-year money
supply (M3) growth at 16.5 per cent
in December 2010 was close to the
indicative projection of 17 per cent,
non-food credit growth at 24.4 per
cent was much above the indicative
projection of 20 per cent. Credit
expansion in the recent period has
been rather sharp, far outpacing the
expansion in deposits. Rapid credit
growth without a commensurate
increase in deposits is not sustainable.
40.
As a result of injection of primary
liquidity of over `67,000 crore through
OMO auctions since early November
2010, the structural liquidity deficit in
the system has declined significantly.
While the Reserve Bank will
endeavour to provide liquidity to meet
the productive credit requirements of a
growing economy, it is important that
credit growth moderates to conform
broadly to the indicative projections.
This will prevent any further build-up of
demand side pressures. Accordingly, the
projection for 2010-11 of M3 growth has
been retained at 17 per cent and that for
non-food credit growth at 20 per cent.
As always, these numbers are indicative
projections and not targets.
9

Risk Factors
41.
The growth and inflation
projections as outlined above are subject
to several risks.
i)

Food inflation has remained at an
elevated level for more than two
years now. It is not only that the
moderation in food price inflation as
expected during a normal monsoon
year has not occurred to the extent
expected, but also that there has been
sharp unusual increase in prices. It
is also significant that food inflation
is not confined to a few items which
were affected by unseasonal rains
in some parts of the country but is
fairly widespread across several food
items. The inflation rates for primary
articles and fuel items have risen
sharply. Inflationary expectations
remain at elevated levels. As high
food inflation persists, the prospect
of it spilling over to the general
inflation process is rapidly becoming
a reality.

ii) Non-food manufacturing inflation
is persistent and has remained
sticky in recent months as several
industries are operating close to
their capacity levels. Imports as
a means to supplement domestic
availability for many commodities
will become less of an option as
global growth consolidates and
capacity
utilisation
increases.
This may accentuate demand side
pressures.
iii) India’s
CAD
has
widened
significantly. Although recent trade
data suggest moderation of the
trade deficit in the latter part of the
year, overall CAD for 2010-11 is
expected to be about 3.5 per cent of

GDP. A CAD of this magnitude is
not sustainable. Further, commodity
prices, which rose sharply even
when the global recovery was
sluggish, may rise further if the
global recovery is faster than
expected. This has implications for
both the CAD and inflation. There
is, therefore, a need for concerted
policy efforts to diversify exports
and contain the CAD within prudent
limits.
iv) Apart from the level of CAD,
financing of CAD also poses a
risk. Global growth prospects have
improved significantly in the recent
period. Should global recovery be
faster than expected, it may also
have implication for the financing of
CAD. Capital flows, which so far have
been broadly sufficient to finance
the CAD, may be adversely affected.
Faster than expected global recovery
may enhance the attractiveness
of investment opportunities in
advanced economies, which may
impact capital flows to India. This
may increase the vulnerability of
our external sector. Hence, the
composition of capital inflows
needs to shift towards longer-term
commitments such as FDI.
v) The recent improvement in the
fiscal situation has been mainly
the result
of one-off revenue
generated from spectrum auctions.
The Government also had the
benefit of disinvestment proceeds,
which may continue to occur for
some more time. However, fiscal
consolidation based on one-off
receipts is not sustainable. As
emphasised in the Second Quarter
Review of November 2010, fiscal
10

consolidation is important for
several reasons, including the fact
that monetary policy works most
efficiently while dealing with an
inflationary situation when the
fiscal situation is under control.
Apart from this, the commodity
price developments that have been
referred to earlier pose significant
risks for fiscal consolidation in the
year ahead. Rising oil prices will
impact prices of both petroleum
products and fertilisers. If the
Government chooses to restrict
the pass-through to consumers
and farmers, it will have to make
adequate budgetary provisions,
which will constrain its ability to
reduce the fiscal deficit. If it does
not, either fiscal credibility will
be undermined or inflationary
expectations will be reinforced
by the likelihood of higher prices
of these key inputs, both of which
will further complicate inflation
management.
vi) The
combined
risks
from
inflation, the CAD and fiscal
situation contribute to an increase
in uncertainty about economic
stability that consumers and
investors will have to deal
with. To the extent that this
deters consumption and investment
decisions, growth may be impacted.
While slower growth may contribute
to some dampening of inflation and
a narrowing of the CAD, it can also
have significant impact on capital
inflows, asset prices and fiscal
consolidation, thereby aggravating
some of the risks that have already
been identified.

III. The Policy Stance
42.
The Reserve Bank began exiting
from the crisis driven expansionary
monetary policy as early as in October
2009. Since then, it has cumulatively
raised the CRR by 100 bps, and the repo
and reverse repo rates under the LAF
by 150 and 200 bps, respectively. As
the overall liquidity in the system has
transited from a surplus to a deficit mode,
the effective tightening in the policy
rate has been of 300 bps. The monetary
policy response was calibrated on the
basis of India specific growth-inflation
dynamics in the broader context of
global uncertainty.
43.
While the Reserve Bank decided
to leave the policy rates unchanged in
the Mid-Quarter Review of December
2010, developments on the inflation
front since then have reinforced the
already elevated concern in this regard.
Accordingly, our monetary policy
stance for the remaining period of
2010-11 has been guided by the following
considerations:


First, since the Second Quarter
Review
of
November
2010,
inflationary
pressures,
which
were abating until then, have
re-emerged significantly. Primary
food articles inflation has risen
again sharply after moderating for
a brief period. Non-food articles
and fuel inflation are already
at elevated levels. Importantly,
non-food manufacturing inflation
has remained sticky. There are,
therefore, signs of rapid food and
fuel price increases spilling over into
generalised inflation. As it is, there
is some evidence of rising demand
side pressures which are reflected
11

in rapid bank credit growth, robust
corporate sales and rising input and
output prices, and buoyancy in tax
revenues. The need, therefore, is
to persist with measures to contain
inflation and anchor inflationary
expectations.


Second, global commodity prices
have risen sharply which has
heightened upside risks to domestic
inflation.



Third, growth has moved close to
its pre-crisis growth trajectory as
reflected in the 8.9 per cent GDP
growth in the first half of 2010-11,
even in the face of an uncertain
global recovery.



Fourth, the global economic
situation has improved in the recent
period. The uncertainty with regard
to global recovery, which was
prevailing at the time of the Second
Quarter Review, has reduced with
the US economy showing signs of
stabilising. Although uncertainty
continues in the Euro area, there
is an overall improvement in the
global growth prospects.

44.
To sum up, the current growthinflation dynamics in the last few weeks
suggest that the balance of risk has tilted
towards intensification of inflation. In
this scenario, the stance of the monetary
policy is intended to :


Contain the spill-over of high food
and fuel inflation into generalised
inflation and anchor inflationary
expectations, while being prepared
to respond to any further build-up
of inflationary pressures.



Maintain an interest rate regime
consistent with price, output and
financial stability.



Manage liquidity to ensure that it
remains broadly in balance, with
neither a surplus diluting monetary
transmission nor a deficit choking
off fund flows.

45.
It is important to emphasise
that the role of monetary policy in
the current inflationary situation is
confi ned to containment and prevention
of food and energy prices from spilling
over into generalised inflation and
anchoring inflation expectations. While
energy prices are driven by global
developments, the food price scenario
is primarily a reflection of persistent
structural constraints in the domestic
agricultural sector. While these have
been known and debated upon for a
long time, the recent price dynamics
highlight the need for rapid action
to increase the output of a number
of products, the demand for which is
being driven by changing consumption
patterns reflecting increasing incomes.

Unless meaningful output enhancing
measures are taken, the risks of food
inflation becoming entrenched loom
large and threaten both the sustainability
of the current growth momentum and
the realisation of its benefits by a large
number of households.
46.
Another challenge to effective
management of inflation by monetary
policy arises from the persistence
of a large fiscal deficit. While the
Government may succeed in raising
receipts, both from high tax buoyancy
and one-off sources, the real measure
of fiscal consolidation lies in improving
the quality of expenditure. If
the
Government is able to commit more
resources to capital expenditure, it will
help deal with some of the bottlenecks
that
contribute
to
supply-side
inflationary pressures. With reference
to revenue expenditure, while large and
diffused subsidies may contribute in
the short term to keeping supply-side
inflationary pressures in check, they
may more than offset this benefit by
adding to aggregate demand.

On the basis of the current
assessment and in line with the policy
stance as outlined in Section III, the
following monetary policy measures
are announced.

Repo Rate

Bank Rate
48.

The Bank Rate has been retained
12

49.


It has been decided to:
increase the repo rate under the
liquidity adjustment facility (LAF)
by 25 basis points from 6.25 per
cent to 6.5 per cent with immediate
effect.

Reverse Repo Rate

Expected Outcomes

50.

54.



It has been decided to:
increase the reverse repo rate under
the LAF by 25 basis points from
5.25 per cent to 5.50 per cent with
immediate effect.

Cash Reserve Ratio
51.
The cash reserve ratio (CRR)
of scheduled banks has been retained
at 6.0 per cent of their net demand and
time liabilities (NDTL).
Liquidity Management Measures
52.
On the basis of an assessment
of the current liquidity situation, it has
been decided to extend the following
liquidity management measures:
i)

The additional liquidity support to
scheduled commercial banks under
the LAF to the extent of up to one
per cent of their net demand and
time liabilities (NDTL), currently
set to expire on January 28, 2011, is
now extended up to April 8, 2011.
For any shortfall in maintenance of
the SLR arising out of availment of
this facility, banks may seek waiver
of penal interest purely as an ad hoc
measure.

ii) The second LAF (SLAF) will be
conducted on a daily basis up to
April 8, 2011.
53.
The
Reserve
Bank
will
constantly monitor the credit growth
and, if necessary, will engage with banks
which show an abnormal incremental
credit-deposit ratio.
13

These actions are expected to:

(i) Contain the spill-over from rise in
food and fuel prices to generalised
inflation.
(ii) Rein
in
rising
inflationary
expectations, which may be
aggravated by the structural and
transitory nature of food price
increases.
(iii) Be moderate enough not to disrupt
growth.
(iv) Continue to provide comfort to
banks in their liquidity management
operations.
Guidance
55.
Current growth and inflation
trends warrant persistence with the antiinflationary monetary stance. Looking
beyond 2010-11, the Reserve Bank expects
domestic growth momentum to stabilise,
though the GDP growth rate may decline
somewhat as agriculture reverts to its trend
(assuming a normal monsoon). Inflation is
likely to resume its moderating trend in
the first quarter of 2011-12, but several
upside risks are already visible in the
global environment and more may surface
domestically. The monetary stance will be
determined by how these factors impact
the overall inflationary scenario. For the
fiscal consolidation process to be credible
and effective, it is important that apart from
augmenting revenue, the composition and
quality of expenditure improves. Any
slippage in the fiscal consolidation process
at this stage may render the process of
inflation management even harder.
56.
The frictional liquidity shortage
is expected to ease as government
balances adjust to the expenditure

schedule. However, banks need to focus
on the underlying structural cause of
liquidity tightness arising out of the gap
between the credit and deposit growth
rates.
