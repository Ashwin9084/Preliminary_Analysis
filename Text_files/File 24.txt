Statement by Dr. Y. Venugopal Reddy,
Governor, Reserve Bank of India on the
Third Quarter Review of Annual Monetary Policy
for the Year 2007-08
This Review consists of three sections: I. Assessment of
Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments; II. Stance of
Monetary Policy; and III. Monetary Measures. An analytical profile
of macroeconomic and monetary developments was issued a day
in advance as a supplement to this Review, providing the
necessary information and analysis with the help of charts and
tables.

I. Assessment of Macroeconomic and
Monetary Developments
Domestic Developments
2.
The growth of real gross domestic product (GDP)
moderated to 8.9 per cent in the second quarter (July-September)
of 2007-08 from 9.3 per cent in the first quarter and 10.2 per cent
a year ago, as per the end-November 2007 release of the Central
Statistical Organisation (CSO). Accordingly, real GDP growth was
placed at 9.1 per cent in the first half of 2007-08, somewhat lower
than 9.9 per cent a year ago. Real GDP originating in agriculture,
industry and services sectors rose by 3.7 per cent, 9.5 per
cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively, during the first half of
2007-08 as against 2.8 per cent, 11.0 per cent and 11.6 per cent
a year ago.
3.
Domestic economic activity continued to be steered by
investment demand, with gross fixed capital formation (GFCF)
increasing by 15.5 per cent in real terms in the first half of
1

2007-08 (14.5 per cent a year ago); on the other hand, private
final consumption expenditure (PFCE) increased by 5.6 per cent
(6.4 per cent). In nominal terms, the share of GFCF in GDP
increased to 31.8 per cent from 29.6 per cent a year ago whereas
the share of PFCE declined to 56.5 per cent from 57.6 per cent.
4.
The first advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture
place kharif foodgrains production at 112.2 million tonnes in
2007-08 - higher than 110.5 million tonnes in 2006-07, but below
the target of 114.2 million tonnes. Available information suggests
that by January 18, 2008 rabi sowing acreage was 3.7 per cent
lower in the current season than its level a year ago. Declines
have been recorded in area sown under wheat (-2.1 per cent),
rice (-5.6 per cent), pulses (-5.0 per cent) and major oilseeds
(-9.9 per cent) whereas some increase was reported in the
area sown under coarse cereals (1.8 per cent). While the
cumulative rainfall during the North-East monsoon season
(October-December 2007) was 32 per cent below normal, it is
relevant to note here that major rabi producing regions like
Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, western Uttar Pradesh and
eastern Madhya Pradesh had received deficient rainfall in the
2007 South-West monsoon season. As on January 17, 2008
live storage in 81 major reservoirs was 55 per cent of the
designated capacity which is 7.1 per cent lower than the
level a year ago though 17.3 per cent higher than the last
10 years' average.
5.
Against the backdrop of developments in the first half of
2007-08, industrial activity has experienced further deceleration
in the third quarter of the year. The index of industrial production
(IIP) rose by 9.2 per cent during April-November 2007 as
compared with 10.9 per cent a year ago. The manufacturing
sector, which contributed 89.9 per cent of the increase in
2

industrial production up to November 2007, recorded a growth
of 9.8 per cent (11.8 per cent a year ago), led by chemical and
chemical products, basic metals and alloys, machinery and
equipment other than transport, and products of wood, leather,
rubber, plastic, petroleum and coal. On the other hand,
deceleration was observed in textiles and transport equipment
and parts. The production of metal products and parts declined.
The continued buoyancy of investment demand was reflected
in the growth in capital goods production at 20.8 per cent
(17.4 per cent) supported by the growth in production of basic
goods by 8.4 per cent (9.4 per cent), in intermediate goods by
10.1 per cent (11.1 per cent) while consumer non-durable goods
output rose by 7.8 per cent (8.9 per cent), the production of
consumer durables goods declined by 1.7 per cent (increased
by 12.4 per cent). Mining and electricity generation recorded
increases of 4.9 per cent (4.2 per cent) and 7.0 per cent (7.3 per cent),
respectively. The six infrastructure industries, comprising 26.7
per cent of the IIP, posted a lower growth of 6.0 per cent during
April-November 2007 as compared with 8.9 per cent a year ago.
All the infrastructure sectors, viz., electricity generation, production
of crude petroleum and petroleum refinery products, cement, coal
and finished steel registered lower growth as compared with the
corresponding period of the previous year.
6.
Private corporate sector activity exhibited some moderation
in the first half of 2007-08. Overall sales of sampled non-financial
private companies increased by 17.4 per cent as compared with
27.4 per cent in the first half of 2006-07. Other income from
non-core activities registered a high increase of 63.6 per cent
as compared with 19.3 per cent a year ago and accounted for
29.5 per cent of post-tax profits. Operational costs increased on
account of a substantial rise in staff costs and other expenses
vis-à-vis sales growth; however, raw material costs grew at a
3

slower rate in relation to sales, partly on account of cheaper
imports. Reflecting the differential between growth in sales vis-à-vis
expenditure, operating profits increased by 20.0 per cent in
April-September 2007. Interest cost continued to be low as the
interest to gross profit ratio came down from an average of around
50.0 per cent in 1990s to 39.0 per cent in 2000-05, 13.0
per cent in 2005-07 and to 11.7 per cent during the first half of
2007-08. Depreciation provisions increased by 15.1 per cent in
April-September 2007 as compared with 16.1 per cent a year
ago. Net profits rose by 31.1 per cent as compared with 41.6
per cent in April-September 2006, attributable to some
moderation in consumer demand growth and high base effects.
Non-manufacturing companies (IT, communication and other
services) performed better than manufacturing companies, with a
growth of 26.4 per cent and 48.4 per cent in sales and net profits,
respectively, in contrast to 15.1 per cent and 25.1 per cent for
manufacturing companies. Buoyant equity markets have enabled
higher mobilisation of resources by the private corporate sector
through public issues and private placements in 2007-08 so far
than in the corresponding period of 2006-07. Early results for
the third quarter of 2007-08 (October-December 2007) for a
truncated sample of companies indicate that the moderation
witnessed in sales growth during the first half has been
somewhat arrested and profitability ratios have been shored up
by income from both core and non-core activities. The growth in
raw material cost and depreciation provisions was lower than in
the corresponding quarter a year ago. Operating profits have
been reinforced by other income representing non-sales activities
of companies.
7.
The Reserve Bank's Industrial Outlook Survey conducted
during November 2007 indicates some moderation in the
underlying business optimism with the share of respondents
4

expecting a better overall business situation in January-March
2008 being a shade lower than in the previous quarter. The
business expectations index for January-March 2008 at 118.6
declined by 4.7 per cent from the preceding quarter and by
6.2 per cent from the corresponding quarter a year ago. The
moderation in growth expectations is reflected in anticipation of
some deceleration in production and order books growth.
Increase in raw material costs, however, has fuelled increased
expectations of higher working capital finance requirements for
January-March 2008 than in the previous quarter, and some
tightening in the overall financial situation and availability of
finance is perceived. Significant augmentation in capacities is
seen in order to meet the increased production requirements and
the overall capacity utilisation may be around the same level as
in the last few quarters. Nearly half the firms expect prices of
raw materials to go up but less than a fourth perceive any
increase in their selling prices, indicating weakening of pricing
power. Respondents expect the recent moderation in profit
margins to continue in the next quarter.
8.
Business confidence surveys conducted by other agencies
convey a mixed, though overall positive, picture for the near
future. Purchasing managers' indices (seasonally adjusted) reflect
positive sentiments for end-2007 driven by rising levels in new
business. Local demand is seen as supporting new orders,
although the pace of growth of export orders is decelerating.
A higher level of growth in the third quarter of 2007-08 is also
expected by one agency, propelled by the overall positive
economic conditions of the economy. According to another
agency, the business sector has responded swiftly to
improvements achieved in containing inflation and business
confidence recorded a rebound with respect to the previous
quarter. It has noted that a stronger rupee has tilted purchases
5

of raw material by firms in favour of imports and there is a greater
pessimism on the export front. A recent survey reflects status
quo in business conditions and lower optimism in the consumer
goods sector. Some other indices reflect improvement in business
confidence when compared with the past six months, but lower
business confidence when compared with the corresponding
period of the previous year. A majority of respondents expect
increases in new orders and in exports and more than half
expect employment to increase, though successive hikes in
interest rates and the rising rupee appear to have depressed
sentiment and a weakening of industrial growth in the second
half of 2007-08 is indicated.
9.
Services sector activity was sustained at a robust pace as
reflected in lead indicators. Railway revenue earnings from freight
traffic increased by 8.0 per cent during April-November 2007.
Total telephone connections in the telecommunications sector
increased by 42.4 per cent, and 3.56 million new telephone lines
were added to the switching capacity of telephone exchanges.
Export and import cargo handled by the civil aviation sector
increased by 0.2 per cent and 22.3 per cent, respectively,
whereas cargo handled at major ports increased by 13.1 per cent.
Passengers handled at international and domestic terminals also
registered growth of 13.4 per cent and 25.9 per cent, respectively.
10. Non-food credit extended by scheduled commercial banks
(SCBs) increased by Rs.2,22,842 crore (11.8 per cent) during
the current financial year up to January 4, 2008 as compared
with the increase of Rs.2,56,693 crore (17.5 per cent) in the
corresponding period of 2006-07. There was a decline of
Rs.5,237 crore in food credit as compared with an increase of
Rs.2,392 crore in the previous year.
6

11. On a year-on-year basis, non-food credit of SCBs expanded
by Rs.3,82,155 crore (22.2 per cent) as on January 4, 2008 on
top of the increase of Rs.4,16,418 crore (31.9 per cent) a year
ago. Provisional information available from select SCBs up to
November 2007 indicates that credit to the industrial sector
recorded the highest growth of 25.3 per cent followed by credit
to the agriculture sector (21.4 per cent), the services sector
(20.8 per cent) and personal loans (20.0 per cent). The share of
the services sector in outstanding credit declined from 23.7 per cent
in November 2006 to 23.4 per cent in November 2007. Within
the services sector, real estate loans continued to record a high
growth of 33.0 per cent, although their share in total non-food
bank credit was only 2.6 per cent. Growth in credit off-take by
some other sub-sectors like computer software, professional
services and transport operators was also high, although from a
relatively lower base. Within the personal loans sector which
accounted for 25.4 per cent in total outstanding non-food gross
bank credit, housing loans recorded a year-on-year growth of
15.1 per cent. Industry's share in total non-food bank credit
increased from 38.3 per cent to 39.2 per cent. This followed from a
pick-up in credit flow to industries like infrastructure (34.5 per cent),
textiles (24.4 per cent), metals (27.1 per cent), engineering
(28.4 per cent), food processing (30.0 per cent), petroleum
(17.8 per cent), vehicles (38.5 per cent) and construction (37.0
per cent). The share of infrastructure in total outstanding credit
to industry increased from 20.2 per cent in November 2006 to
21.7 per cent in November 2007. The share of priority sector
advances declined nominally from 34.9 per cent to 34.3 per cent.
12. Commercial banks' investments in shares, bonds/
debentures and commercial paper (CP) increased by Rs.4,679
crore (5.9 per cent) during the current financial year up to
January 4, 2008 as against a marginal decline (Rs.32 crore) in
7

the corresponding period of the previous year. Their investments
in instruments of mutual funds was much higher at Rs.34,155
crore as against Rs.2,130 crore in the corresponding period of
the previous year. The total flow of resources from SCBs to the
commercial sector increased by Rs.2,27,522 crore (10.4 per cent)
during the current financial year so far as compared with the
increase of Rs.2,56,661 crore (16.6 per cent) in the corresponding
period of the previous year. The year-on-year growth in total
resource flow decelerated to 21.7 per cent from 30.1 per cent a
year ago.
13.
Aggregate deposits of SCBs increased by Rs.3,79,898
crore (14.6 per cent) in the current financial year up to January
4, 2008 as compared with an increase of Rs.2,78,398 crore (13.2
per cent) in the corresponding period of the previous year. On a
year-on-year basis, the growth in aggregate deposits at
Rs.6,00,761 crore (25.2 per cent) was higher than that of
Rs.4,44,241 crore (22.9 per cent) a year ago. There has been a
sizeable expansion in term deposits in the current financial year
so far, indicative of migration from small savings schemes of the
Government. The annual incremental non-food credit-deposit ratio
declined to 63.6 per cent from 93.7 per cent a year ago.
14. Commercial banks invested Rs.1,64,458 crore in
Government and other approved securities during the current
financial year up to January 4, 2008, which was substantially
higher than Rs.48,086 crore in the corresponding period of the
previous year. Adjusted for banks' collateral securities under the
liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), however, their investment in
securities increased by Rs.1,02,999 crore during 2007-08 so far
as against an increase of Rs.50,151 crore a year ago. Banks'
holdings of Government and other approved securities at 29.1
per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as on
8

January 4, 2008 was marginally higher than 28.6 per cent a year
ago. SCBs' stock of such securities in excess of the prescribed
statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) amounted to Rs.1,33,017 crore on
January 4, 2008 and adjusted for LAF holdings, these holdings
stood at Rs.99,128 crore or 3.0 per cent of NDTL. Adjusted for
LAF collateral securities and the outstanding issuances under
the market stabilisation scheme or MSS, investment in
Government and other approved securities by SCBs are placed
in the range of 23.0 per cent to 24.0 per cent of NDTL.
15. During the current financial year so far, money supply or M3
(up to January 4, 2008) increased by Rs.4,40,056 crore (13.3
per cent) which was higher than the increase of Rs.3,33,864 crore
(12.2 per cent) in the corresponding period of the previous year
and reflected the sizeable deposit mobilisation by banks,
including shifts out of small savings schemes of the Government.
M3 increased by 22.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis, on
January 4, 2008 which was higher than 20.8 per cent a year
ago and well above the projected trajectory of 17.0-17.5 per cent
indicated in the Annual Policy Statement for 2007-08.
16. On a financial year basis, reserve money increased by
Rs.1,29,034 crore (18.2 per cent) up to January 18, 2008 as
compared with the increase of Rs.68,764 crore (12.0 per cent)
in the corresponding period of the previous year. Currency in
circulation increased by Rs.61,964 crore (12.3 per cent) as
compared with Rs.57,726 crore (13.4 per cent). With the increase
in the cash reserve ratio (CRR), bankers' deposits with the
Reserve Bank registered a higher growth of Rs.69,760 crore
(35.4 per cent) as compared with an increase of Rs.12,319 crore
(9.1 per cent) in the corresponding period of the previous year.
Among the sources of reserve money, Reserve Bank's net credit
to the Central Government declined by Rs.1,57,815 crore as
9

against an increase of Rs.6,963 crore in the corresponding period
of the previous year. Adjusted for issuances under the MSS,
Reserve Bank's net credit to the Central Government showed a
decline of Rs.59,731 crore as compared with an increase of
Rs.18,392 crore a year ago and mainly reflected the exchange
of collateral securities under the LAF and the changes in the
Centre's cash balances (non-MSS) with the Reserve Bank. Due
to sustained net capital inflows, the Reserve Bank's net foreign
exchange assets (NFEA) increased by Rs.2,51,026 crore as
against an increase of Rs.1,14,337 crore during the
corresponding period of the previous year. The Reserve Bank's
foreign currency assets, adjusted for revaluation, increased by
Rs.3,11,941 crore as compared with an increase of Rs.80,166
crore during the corresponding period of the previous year.
Reserve money increased by 30.6 per cent on a year-on-year
basis as on January 18, 2008 as compared with 20.0 per cent a
year ago. Adjusted for the first round effect of the increases in
the CRR, reserve money growth was 21.5 per cent as compared
with 17.5 per cent a year ago. The ratio of NFEA to currency
increased from 171.8 per cent on March 31, 2007 to 197.3
per cent by January 18, 2008.
17. Over the third quarter of 2007-08, movements in the key
monetary and banking aggregates were reflected in generally
easy conditions of liquidity till November 11, 2007. Up to that
period, the banking system experienced conditions of surplus
liquidity on account of substantial deposit mobilisation relative
to credit demand. During November 1-11, 2007 average daily
net absorption under the LAF was Rs.10,384 crore, despite an
additional amount of Rs.3,000 crore absorbed under the MSS.
Thereafter, the system switched to a tighter liquidity mode. With
effect from the fortnight beginning November 10, 2007 the CRR
was raised to 7.50 per cent which implied a liquidity reduction
10

of about Rs. 16,000 crore in the banking system. Between
November 12-22, 2007 there was net injection of liquidity at the
LAF auctions, with repos averaging Rs. 17,911 crore as liquidity
remained tight on account of the increased reserve requirements.
From November 23, 2007 net issuances under the MSS were
halted in view of the prevailing liquidity situation and redemptions
of a cumulative amount of Rs.20,000 crore up to January 11, 2008
released funds to the system. The Centre's cash balances moved
in a steady range between Rs.28,000 crore - Rs.44,000 crore
during this period. However, infusions of liquidity through repo
gradually declined in the subsequent period and there were
intermittent absorptions under the LAF as well.
18. During the first half of December 2007 liquidity conditions
improved, money market rates eased and the LAF returned to
absorption mode; however, liquidity tightened in the second half
of December amidst substantial outflows towards payment of
advance tax. The Centre's cash balances moved up from levels
of Rs.30,000 crore - Rs.40,000 crore in the first half of December
to around Rs.85,000 crore during December 20-27, 2007
exacerbating the liquidity situation. The LAF shifted to injection
mode, with daily repo volumes rising to a peak of Rs.47,665 crore
on December 26, 2007. Liquidity conditions began to ease
towards end-December 2007 through mid-January 2008 with the
LAF returning to absorption mode and the Centre's cash balances
stabilising in the range of Rs.35,000 crore-Rs.60,000 crore. The
outstanding issuances under the MSS fell to Rs.1,58,155 crore
by January 4, 2008 before rising to Rs.1,69,194 crore on January
25, 2008 within the overall ceiling of Rs.2,50,000 crore for 2007-08
as revised on November 7, 2007. The overhang of liquidity as
reflected in the sum of LAF, MSS and the Central Governments'
cash balances increased from Rs.85,770 crore at end-March 2007
to Rs.2,58,187 crore on January 17, 2008 before declining to
Rs.2,32,809 crore on January 24, 2008.
11

19. Inflation, based on variations in the wholesale price index
(WPI) on a year-on-year basis, eased to 3.8 per cent as on
January 12, 2008 from its peak of 6.4 per cent at the beginning
of the financial year and from 6.2 per cent a year ago. On an
annual average basis, inflation at 4.7 per cent was lower than
4.9 per cent a year ago.
20. At a disaggregated level, prices of primary articles (weight:
22.0 per cent in the WPI basket) registered a year-on-year
increase of 3.9 per cent as on January 12, 2008 as compared
with 9.5 per cent a year ago. The relatively lower increase in
prices of primary articles during 2007-08 was mainly due to food
articles; however, prices of non-food primary articles like cotton
and oilseeds went up sharply. Manoeuverability in supply
conditions has been reduced considerably due to the existence
of a relatively low level of stocks and high price increases in
respect of foodgrains in the international markets. The stock of
foodgrains with public agencies was lower than buffer stock
norms during July-October 2007. The stock of foodgrains with
public agencies stood at 19.7 million tonnes in November 2007
as against the norm of 20.0 million tonnes for January 1, 2008
(16.2 million tonnes for November 1, 2007).
21. Inflation in terms of prices of manufactured products
(weight: 63.8 per cent) eased to 3.9 per cent from 5.8 per cent a
year ago, largely on account of the decline in prices of
textiles, sugar and non-ferrous metals and deceleration in
prices of non-electrical machinery, wood and paper. On the
other hand, prices of edible oils, oil cakes, rubber products,
cement, iron and steel and their products and electrical
machinery increased on a year-on-year basis.
22. Inflation in terms of the prices of the 'fuel, power, light and
lubricants' group (weight: 14.2 per cent) was 3.7 per cent as on
12

January 12, 2008 the same as a year ago. Excluding the fuel
group, inflation was at 3.9 per cent (6.9 per cent a year ago).
The price of the Indian basket of international crude has
registered a sustained increase during 2007 from US $ 56.6
per barrel during January-March to US $ 66.4 in April-June,
US $ 72.7 in July-September, US $ 85.7 in October-December
2007 and US $ 88.9 per barrel as on January 25, 2008. While
the subsidy schemes for kerosene and domestic LPG have been
extended till March 2010, domestic retail prices of petrol and
diesel have remained unchanged since February 2007 thereby
increasing the magnitude of incomplete pass-through. Since the
last revision of domestic retail prices of petrol and diesel in
February 2007, the price of the Indian crude basket has increased
by about 56 per cent in US dollar terms and about 39 per cent
in rupee terms (up to December 2007). Prices of the freely
priced petroleum products, on the other hand, have increased
substantially, as for instance, for aviation turbine fuel (36.5
per cent), naphtha (35.0 per cent), bitumen (28.4 per cent) and
furnace oil (36.9 per cent) by January 12, 2008. While the
issuance of oil bonds and burden sharing by upstream oil public
sector units would mitigate a part of the under-recoveries, the
fiscal costs of such operations have associated monetary
implications.
23. In the light of the spurt in international crude oil prices,
public authorities in many countries have taken initiatives to
protect domestic consumers and to minimise the adverse effects
of the pass-through of oil prices to domestic inflation. As against
a four-fold rise in average international crude prices over the
period 2003-2007, domestic prices of major petroleum products
have risen by only 50 per cent in India (LPG and kerosene prices
have remained unchanged), by 70 per cent in China and by
150 per cent in Indonesia. Cross-country analysis of end-user
13

prices of the pass-through, however, needs to adjust for the
wedge created by the tax components which ranges from high
in European countries to low in the US where the retail prices
are determined in a competitive market with an efficient refining
industry and can be considered as an approximate benchmark
for assessing the pass-through for countries with low taxes.
An analysis of the tax component in composite barrel price
across countries indicates that the tax component has been
brought down substantially by both high-tax and low-tax countries
in the recent years in the wake of hardening of crude prices.
According to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC), the share of taxes has come down during 1999-2006
from 70 per cent to 53 per cent in France, from 69 per cent to 56
per cent in Italy, from 63 per cent to 57 per cent in Germany, from 68
per cent to 62 per cent in the UK, from 38 per cent to 29 per cent in
Canada and from 31 per cent to 25 per cent in the US.
24. Inflation based on the consumer price index (CPI) for
industrial workers (IW) declined to 5.5 per cent on a year-on-year
basis in November 2007 from 6.3 per cent a year ago. The CPI
for urban non-manual employees (UNME), agricultural labourers
(AL) and rural labourers (RL) also declined to 5.1 per cent, 5.9
per cent and 5.6 per cent, respectively, in December 2007 as
compared with 6.9 per cent, 8.9 per cent and 8.3 per cent a year
ago. Prices of food items, which have a higher weightage in the
CPI basket relative to the WPI, are the major cause of CPI
inflation consistently ruling above WPI inflation during the current
year. Average inflation based on CPI for IW was 6.5 per cent
in November 2007 as compared with 6.1 per cent a year ago.
On an annual average basis, inflation based on CPI for UNME,
AL and RL increased to 6.5 per cent, 8.2 per cent and 7.8 per cent,
respectively, in December 2007 as compared with 6.0 per cent,
6.7 per cent and 6.4 per cent a year ago.
14

25. Revenue receipts of the Union Government improved to
56.5 per cent of the budget estimates (BE) in April-November
2007 from 54.8 per cent in April-November 2006. As a proportion
to BE, revenue expenditure at 61.8 per cent was comparable
with 62.6 per cent a year ago. Within capital expenditure, Plan
and non-Plan expenditure were 67.0 per cent and 20.5 per cent
(net of transactions relating to transfer of the Reserve Bank's
stake in the State Bank of India to the Government) of BE,
respectively, as compared with 53.9 per cent and 32.6 per cent
in the corresponding period of the previous year. As a proportion
to BE, the revenue deficit was 97.9 per cent as compared with
99.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year
whereas the gross fiscal deficit decelerated to 63.8 per cent
from 72.8 per cent a year ago. In recent months, there has
been deceleration in mobilisation under small savings. On
December 7, 2007 it was announced that the five-year post office
time deposit accounts and the senior citizen savings scheme
would enjoy the same tax treatment as bank deposits. The
element of bonus on post office monthly income accounts has
also been restored.
26. The gross market borrowings of the Central Government
through dated securities at Rs.1,47,000 crore (Rs.1,30,000 crore
a year ago) during 2007-08 so far (up to January 25, 2008)
constituted 94.6 per cent of the BE. Net market borrowings at
Rs.1,03,092 crore (Rs.91,432 crore a year ago) constituted 94.1
per cent of the BE. The weighted average yield and weighted
average maturity of Central Government securities issued during
2007-08 so far were at 8.15 per cent and 14.57 years,
respectively, as compared with 7.89 per cent and 14.72 years
for those issued during 2006-07 (full year). In addition, securities
amounting to Rs.15,147 crore have been issued by the Central
Government (excluding MSS) beyond the regular market
15

borrowing programme for 2007-08 to fertiliser companies and to
oil companies for partial compensation of under-recoveries, over
and above issuances of such securities to the tune of Rs.40,321
crore during 2006-07. In addition to provisional net allocation of
Rs.28,781 crore for 2007-08, additional allocations of Rs.2,834
crore were made to certain States and Rs.35,518 crore was
allocated to meet the shortfall in receipt from the national small
savings fund (NSSF). Accordingly, total net allocation for States
stood at Rs.67,133 crore (gross Rs.78,687 crore) for 2007-08
against which they raised a net amount of Rs.35,895 crore (gross
Rs.47,449 crore) during the current year up to January 25, 2008.
27. During the third quarter of 2007-08, money, debt and
foreign exchange markets remained generally stable, despite
large movements in liquidity conditions. Overnight interest
rates, which averaged around 6.0 per cent in the first eleven
days of November, rose to the upper end of the LAF corridor
by mid-December and hardened further in the second half of
December on account of reduction in liquidity with the banking
system due to sizeable tax outflows and build-up of the Centre's
cash balances. Thereafter, overnight rates have softened. The
call money rate, which had declined from 14.07 per cent in March
2007 to 6.03 per cent in October, rose to 6.98 per cent in
November and to a peak of 7.95 on December 26, averaging
7.50 per cent in December 2007. Thereafter, call rates remained
within the informal LAF corridor and averaged 6.57 per cent in
January 2008 (up to January 25, 2008). Overnight rates in other
segments, viz., market repo and collateralised borrowing and
lending obligations (CBLO) ruled around the call money rate
during the period. Market repo (other than LAF) declined from
8.13 per cent in March 2007 to 5.87 per cent in October 2007
and increased to 7.36 per cent in December 2007, before
declining to 6.33 per cent in January 2008 (up to January 25,
16

2008). CBLO rates moved from 7.73 per cent in March 2007 to
5.61 per cent in October 2007, before increasing to 7.18 per cent
in December 2007. However, they declined to 6.17 per cent in
January 2008 (up to January 25, 2008). The daily average
volume (one leg) in the call money market decreased from
Rs.11,608 crore in March 2007 to Rs.8,124 crore in December
2007. The corresponding volumes in the market repo and CBLO
segments increased from Rs.8,687 crore and Rs.17,662 crore,
respectively, in March 2007 to Rs.13,354 crore and Rs.30,087
crore in December 2007. As on January 25, 2008, call, market
repo and CBLO rates were 7.37 per cent, 7.40 per cent and
4.41 per cent, respectively.
28. The primary yields on 91-day Treasury Bills decelerated
to 7.10 per cent on January 25, 2008 from 7.98 per cent at
end-March 2007 and 7.31 per cent in end-October 2007. Yields
on 364-day Treasury Bills moved to 7.39 per cent on January
25, 2008 from 7.98 per cent at end-March 2007 and 7.36 per cent
in end-October 2007. The weighted average discount rate
(WADR) on CP declined to 9.20 per cent by end-December 2007
from 11.33 per cent at end-March and the outstanding amount of
CP increased from Rs.17,688 crore to Rs.40,231 crore over this
period. In the market for certificates of deposit (CDs) also, WADR
declined from 10.75 per cent at end-March 2007 to 8.81 per cent
by December 21, 2007 accompanied by an increase of 32.4
per cent in the outstanding amount (i.e., from Rs.93,272 crore
to Rs.1,23,466 crore).
29. Rapid growth in turnover in the foreign exchange market
was sustained by large surplus conditions in the spot market as
average daily turnover increased to US $ 50.1 billion for the
quarter ended December 2007 from US $ 27.6 billion in the
corresponding quarter of the previous year. With increasing
17

volumes of current and capital account transactions, the merchant
turnover increased to US $ 15.5 billion from US $ 7.8 billion
while the inter-bank turnover increased to US $ 34.6 billion from
US $ 19.8 billion. There has been a general softening in forward
premia across all maturities over end-March 2007 but some
hardening was witnessed after October 2007. The six-month forward
premia eased from 3.60 per cent in March 2007 to 2.53 per cent by
end-June 2007 and further to 1.67 per cent by end-October before
it increased to 2.12 per cent on January 25, 2008.
30. The yield on Government securities with one-year residual
maturity declined from 7.55 per cent at end-March 2007 to 7.30
per cent as on January 25, 2008. The yield on Government
securities with 10-year and 20-year residual maturity also
declined from 7.97 per cent and 8.23 per cent, respectively, to
7.46 per cent and 7.66 per cent. The yield spread between
10-year and one-year Government securities narrowed from 42
basis points to 16 basis points and the spread between 20-year
and one-year Government securities reduced from 68 basis points
to 36 basis points during this period.
31. During March 2007-January 2008, pubic sector banks
(PSBs) that were earlier paying higher interest rates on longer
term deposits, readjusted their interest rates downwards by
25-50 basis points, while those offering lower deposit rates for
similar maturity earlier increased their deposit rates by 50-75
basis points. Similarly, PSBs paying higher interest rates earlier
on shorter term deposits of up to one year maturity also revised
their deposit rates downwards by 25 basis points. In particular,
the interest rates offered by the PSBs on deposits of above one
year maturity moved from the range of 7.25-9.50 per cent in March
2007 to 8.00-9.25 per cent in January 2008, while deposit rates
for shorter term deposits of up to one year maturity decreased
18

from the range of 2.75-8.75 per cent to 2.75-8.50 per cent during
the same period. On the other hand, private sector banks
increased their interest rates for long term deposits of above one
year maturity from a range of 6.75-9.75 per cent to 7.25-10.00
per cent during the same period. On the lending side, the
benchmark prime lending rates (BPLRs) of PSBs increased by
25-75 basis points from a range of 12.25-12.75 per cent to
12.50-13.50 per cent. The private sector banks increased their
BPLR from a range of 12.00-16.50 per cent to a range of
13.00-16.50 per cent, in the same period. The range of BPLRs
for foreign banks, however, remained unchanged at 10.00-15.50
per cent during the same period.
32. Buoyancy in the equity market continued in terms of large
issuances in the domestic primary segment as well as in
international stock exchanges. The secondary market witnessed
high volatility despite positive sentiments. The BSE Sensex
(1978-79=100) increased from 13,072 at end-March 2007 to cross
the 15,000 level on July 9, 2007, the 20,000 level on December
11, 2007 and closed at 18,362 on January 25, 2008 registering
an increase of 40.5 per cent over end-March 2007. According to
data released by the Securities and Exchange Board of India
(SEBI), net investments by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in
the equity market were significantly higher at Rs.50,201 crore
(US $ 12.1 billion) during the current financial year up to January
25, 2008 as compared with Rs.19,161 crore (US $ 4.1 billion) in
the corresponding period of the previous year. In October 2007,
SEBI made changes in FII registration criteria by modifying the
broad-based criteria considering the track record of the applicant,
limiting the issuance of offshore derivative instruments/
participatory notes (ODIs/PNs) to only "regulated" entities instead
of "registered" entities and giving a road-map for gradual phasing
out of existing ODIs/PNs. Also, FII and sub-account registration
19

has been made perpetual, subject to fee payment. Despite these
regulatory measures, there has been considerable volatility in
portfolio flows which has been reflected in large movements in
stock prices. During April-December 2007, mutual funds mobilised
net funds of the order of Rs.1,23,993 crore as against Rs.79,708
crore a year ago.
Developments in the External Sector
33. Balance of payments data released by the Reserve Bank
at the end of December 2007 indicate some widening of the
merchandise trade deficit in the first half of 2007-08. External
financing requirements were comfortably met by the sustained
buoyancy in invisibles and sizeable net capital inflows which also
enabled a build-up of international reserves. In US dollar terms,
merchandise export growth was 19.9 per cent during April-September
2007 as against 25.4 per cent in the first half of the previous
year. Commodity-wise data available from the Directorate
General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S) for
April-September 2007 indicate that the growth of exports of
primary products moderated to 15.3 per cent from 18.4 per cent.
Exports of manufactures registered a lower growth of 14.1 per cent
in April-September 2007 as against 18.3 per cent a year ago.
While exports of iron ore showed a turnaround, increasing by
22.7 per cent from a decline of 8.2 per cent a year ago, growth
of exports of chemicals and related products moderated to
11.4 per cent as compared with 22.0 per cent and growth of
exports of textiles and related products moderated to 1.3 per cent
as against an increase of 11.6 per cent. Exports of chemicals
and related products, petroleum products, engineering goods and
gems and jewellery together contributed around three-fourth of
overall export growth. Merchandise import payments rose by
21.9 per cent during April-September 2007 as compared with
20

24.7 per cent a year ago. As per DGCI&S data, oil imports
increased by 16.9 per cent in the first half of the current financial
year as against 41.2 per cent in April-September 2006, although
the average price of the Indian basket of international crude rose
from US $ 67.4 per barrel to US $ 69.3 per barrel over this period.
Non-oil import growth at 33.2 per cent was substantially higher
than 16.1 per cent a year ago and mainly attributable to imports
of capital goods, export-related items and gold and silver vis-à-vis
the previous year. China remained the major source of imports
accounting for 11.2 per cent of total imports and 16.3 per cent of
non-oil imports in April-September 2007. On a payments basis,
the merchandise trade deficit widened to US $ 42.4 billion in
the first half of 2007-08 from US $ 33.8 billion a year ago.
34. Gross invisible receipts comprising services, current
transfers and income are gaining importance in India's
external transactions in recent years. At US $ 61.6 billion in
April-September 2007, gross invisible receipts were equivalent
to 83.6 per cent of merchandise exports as against 81.2 per cent
a year ago. Software exports, travel earnings, other professional
and business services and remittances from overseas Indians
buttressed invisible receipts which increased by 23.4 per cent
during April-September 2007 as against 31.0 per cent a year
ago. On the other hand, invisible payments increased by 13.0
per cent, mainly on account of a surge in payments related to
travel, business and management consultancy, engineering and
other technical services and dividend and profit payments. On a
net basis, the invisible account recorded a surplus of US $ 31.7
billion during the first half of 2007-08 as against US $ 23.4 billion
in the corresponding period of the previous year. The current
account deficit (CAD) at US $ 10.7 billion in the first half of
2007-08 was comparable to US $ 10.3 billion during the first
half of 2006-07.
21

35. Net capital flows surged to US $ 50.4 billion during
April-September 2007 from US $ 19.2 billion a year ago.
Among its components, net external commercial borrowings
(ECB) inflows at US $ 10.6 billion were higher than US $ 5.7
billion in the first half of the previous year. Net portfolio
investment including FIIs at US $ 18.3 billion during the first
half of 2007-08 was also higher than US $ 1.6 billion during
April-September 2006. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) into
India was higher at US $ 9.9 billion during the first half of the
current year against US $ 7.3 billion a year ago. Outward FDI
from India showed a significant increase to US $ 6.0 billion in
the first half of 2007-08 on account of global expansion of Indian
companies as compared with US $ 2.8 billion a year ago.
Reflecting the drawdown of assets held abroad by the banking
system, net inflow from other banking capital showed a higher
increase of US $ 5.3 billion as compared with US $ 3.3 billion a
year ago. On the back of growing trade volumes, net short-term
trade credit (inclusive of suppliers' credit up to 180 days)
increased by US $ 5.7 billion in the first half of 2007-08 as
compared with US $ 3.9 billion in April-September 2006. On the
other hand, there was a net outflow of US $ 0.1 billion from
deposits of non-resident Indians (NRI) in the first half of 2007-08
as against net inflows of US $ 2.2 billion in the first half of
2006-07, mainly on account of the reduction in the ceiling on
interest rates during February and April 2007.
36. The foreign exchange reserves (excluding valuation)
increased by US $ 40.4 billion during April-September 2007 which
was much higher than the accretion of US $ 8.6 billion in the first
half of 2006-07 and reflected the overall movements in current
and capital accounts of the balance of payments. Taking into
account the valuation gain of US $ 8.2 billion, foreign exchange
reserves increased by US $ 48.6 billion during April-September
2007 as against US $ 13.7 billion in the first half of 2006-07.
22

37. India's external debt increased by US $ 20.9 billion during
April-September 2007 and amounted to US $ 190.5 billion at
end-September 2007. ECB increased by US $ 10.0 billion while
there was an increase of US $ 4.6 billion in short-term debt,
essentially brought about by a rise in trade credits. There were
moderate increases in multilateral and bilateral debt to the tune
of US $ 1.7 billion and US $ 0.6 billion. Valuation changes
arising on account of the weakening of the US dollar vis-à-vis
other major international currencies added US $ 7.0 billion to
the stock of external debt and explained one-third of the increase
in external debt. Commercial borrowings accounted for the
highest share (27.2 per cent) in the total debt stock, followed by
NRI deposits (22.9 per cent), multilateral debt (19.5 per cent) and
bilateral debt (8.7 per cent). The US dollar had a dominant share of
52.8 per cent in India's external debt whereas rupee-denominated
debt had a share of 17.6 per cent. The ratio of short-term debt to
total debt increased to 16.2 per cent at end-September 2007 from
15.5 per cent at end-March 2007. The ratio of foreign exchange
reserves to external debt increased to 130.0 per cent at end-September
2007 as compared with 117.4 per cent at end-March 2007.
38. In the second half of 2007-08, these developments have
gained strength. According to the DGCI&S, merchandise exports rose
by 21.9 per cent in US dollar terms during April-November 2007 as
compared with 26.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the
previous year. Import growth was lower at 26.9 per cent as
compared with 27.4 per cent in the previous year mainly on account
of a lower growth of 9.8 per cent in oil imports as compared with
42.0 per cent a year ago, despite a rise of 12.5 per cent in the
price of the Indian basket of crude oil over this period. Non-oil
imports, on the other hand, increased by 35.3 per cent as
compared with 21.3 per cent a year ago and accounted for nearly
88.0 per cent of the growth of total imports. As a result, the
23

merchandise trade deficit widened to US $ 52.8 billion during
April-November 2007 from US $ 38.5 billion in April-November 2006.
39. Available information also points to a further increase in
various elements of capital flows in relation to their levels a year
ago and in the first half of 2007-08. Portfolio flows have picked
up strongly on account of FIIs, amounting to US $ 26.8 billion
during 2007-08 (up to January 11, 2008) as compared with an
inflow of US $ 2.5 billion in the corresponding period of 2006-07.
Gross FDI inflows during April-November 2007 were placed at
US $ 13.8 billion as compared with US $ 10.8 billion a year
ago. ECB approvals, including under the automatic route,
amounted to US $ 23.3 billion during April-December 2007 as
compared with US $ 15.3 billion in the corresponding period of
the previous year. On the other hand, there were net outflows
under NRI deposits of US $ 0.4 billion in April-November 2007
as compared with inflows of US $ 3.0 billion during AprilNovember 2006. ADR/GDR issues by Indian companies
amounted to US $ 5.7 billion during April-November 2007 as
against US $ 1.9 billion in the corresponding period in the
previous year. The foreign exchange reserves increased by
US $ 85.7 billion during the current financial year so far and
stood at US $ 284.9 billion on January 18, 2008.
40. The exchange rate of the rupee against the US dollar,
which was Rs.43.59 at end-March 2007, appreciated thereafter
to reach Rs.40.96 at end-August 2007 and strengthened further
to Rs.39.40 per US dollar as on January 25, 2008. During
September 29, 2007-January 25, 2008, the movements of the
rupee vis-à-vis the US dollar generally remained range-bound
in the band of Rs.39-40 per US dollar. By January 25, 2008, the
rupee appreciated by 9.61 per cent against the US dollar, by
8.85 per cent against the pound sterling and by 0.95 per cent
against the Japanese yen over the end-March 2007 level.
24

Against the euro, the rupee remained at its end-March 2007 level
as on January 25, 2008. Over the end-September 2007 level,
however, the rupee appreciated by 0.86 per cent against the
US dollar and by 2.96 per cent against the pound sterling,
whereas it depreciated by 3.27 per cent against the euro and by
6.29 per cent against the Japanese yen.
41. The exchange rate policy in recent years has been
guided by the broad principles of careful monitoring and
management of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed
target or a pre-announced target or a band, coupled with the
ability to intervene, if and when necessary. The overall approach
to the management of India's foreign exchange reserves takes
into account the changing composition of the balance of
payments and endeavours to reflect the 'liquidity risks' associated
with different types of flows and other requirements.
Developments in the Global Economy
42. During the fourth quarter of 2007, financial markets in
developed economies experienced tight conditions following
the turbulence witnessed since July 2007 in response to the
US subprime mortgage crisis. Reduced financial leverage, lower
credit availability and negative wealth effects have emerged as
risks to consumption and growth, especially in the US. Firm
inflationary pressures from food prices and high and volatile
crude prices are other risks to the outlook. Substantial downside
risks continue to be associated with respect to housing
developments in the US and Europe and the fall-out on financial
institutions/markets in an environment of heightened systemic
risks and high volatility. According to the World Economic Outlook
(WEO) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released in
October 2007, the forecast for global real GDP growth on a
25

purchasing power parity basis is placed at 5.2 per cent for 2007
as compared with 5.4 per cent in 2006, and is expected to
decelerate further to 4.8 per cent in 2008.
43. In the US, real GDP growth had risen to 4.9 per cent in
the third quarter of 2007 as compared with 1.1 per cent a year
ago. In the fourth quarter, labour markets weakened with the
unemployment rate rising to 5.0 per cent in December 2007 and
job growth the weakest since August 2003. The home builders'
housing market index stayed at a 22-year low for the fourth
straight month in January 2008 with mortgage delinquencies
rising to the highest level since 1986. Real GDP growth is
expected to slow down from the fourth quarter of 2007 onwards
as the deepening housing market correction and ongoing
financial market turmoil are expected to curb growth more
severely, although exports could play a mitigating role. Industrial
production declined by one per cent in the fourth quarter and
capacity utilisation declined further in December 2007 from the
peak reached in August 2007. Durable goods orders were weak
reflecting sluggish investment spending. The IMF's October 2007
WEO expects the US economy to grow at a slower pace of
1.9 per cent in 2007 and 2008 as against 2.9 per cent in 2006.
44. Real GDP in the euro area grew by 2.7 per cent in the
third quarter of 2007 on a year-on-year basis as compared with
2.8 per cent a year ago. Unemployment fell in November 2007
to a record low of 7.2 per cent. In the German economy _ the
largest in the euro area _ however, the business climate has
worsened in December after a brief improvement in November
and the cyclical dynamics are seen as weakening for the next
six months. With rising defaults on consumer loans, the credit
crisis appears to be adversely impacting financial conditions in
Europe. A more restrictive credit policy by banks is likely to affect
26

companies with weak credit ratings. The October 2007 update
of the IMF's WEO has placed average annual real GDP growth of
the euro area at 2.5 per cent in 2007 and 2.1 per cent in 2008.
45. The Japanese economy grew by 2.6 per cent in the third
quarter of 2007 as compared with 1.4 per cent a year ago.
Surveys reveal that the business sentiment of large Japanese
manufacturers was worse than expected during the quarter ending
December 31, and is forecast to deteriorate further in the coming
quarter. The Bank of Japan expects the pace of Japan's economic
growth to decelerate due to a big drop in housing investment
and the slowdown is likely to persist for some time. Consumer
sentiment in Japan has been worsening with higher crude oil
prices and the rising prices of daily necessities. The October
2007 WEO of the IMF has projected real GDP growth in Japan
at 2.0 per cent in 2007 and 1.7 per cent in 2008.
46. In emerging Asia, economic activity has continued to
expand at a sustained pace, especially in the largest economies
of the region, despite the volatile global setting. The Chinese
economy grew by 11.4 per cent in 2007 as compared with
11.1 per cent recorded in 2006, despite policy efforts to curb
growth by controlling high-polluting, energy-intensive industries
as well as monetary tightening policies, reduction of export
rebates and restrictions on processing exports. Inflation
accelerated to 6.9 per cent in November 2007 as compared with
1.9 per cent in November 2006. In 2008, the Chinese economy
is expected to moderate to a growth of 10.0 per cent as tightening
policies take effect. The impact of losses of China's financial
institutions and the transmission of financial turmoil to China's
markets seems to be limited. Deceleration of export growth
reflecting weaker demand from the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and China's
27

domestic policies restraining low-end exports could reduce
GDP growth.
47. In recent months, the Chinese authorities have cut the
rebate on value added taxes (VAT) and have increased export
taxes on some products to discourage balance of payment
surpluses and reduce funds flow to the stock markets which have
reached elevated levels. China ran a record US $ 262.2 billion
trade surplus in 2007, despite slowdown in export growth and the
negative impact of the US subprime crisis, which is 48.0 per cent
higher than in the preceding year, contributing to the overhang
of liquidity in the economy. China's foreign exchange reserves
reached US $ 1.53 trillion at the end of 2007.
48. Among other major Asian economies, the Korean economy
grew by 5.5 per cent in 2007, higher than 5.0 per cent in 2006,
led by exports, due to higher sales in emerging markets such as
China. Consumer price inflation had accelerated to 3.6 per cent
in December 2007 from 3.0 per cent in October 2007. In Thailand,
the economy is expected to grow at 4.8 per cent in 2007, driven
by robust export growth and expansionary public expenditures that
support the economy at the time when private expenditures have
been slowing down. In 2008, the Thai economy is forecast to
grow in the range of 4.5-6.0 per cent. Inflation decelerated to 3.2
per cent in 2007 from 3.50 per cent in 2006.
49. In the US, consumer prices increased from 2.5 per cent in
2006 to 4.1 per cent in 2007. In the euro area, inflation increased
to 3.1 per cent in 2007 from 1.9 per cent a year ago. In Japan,
inflation increased to 0.7 per cent in 2007 from 0.3 per cent a
year ago. In the UK, CPI inflation declined to 2.1 per cent in
2007 from 3.0 per cent in 2006. At the retail level (in terms of
retail prices index or RPI), inflation rose to 4.8 per cent in the
28

UK in March 2007 _ the highest since 1991 _ but declined
thereafter to 3.8 per cent in July 2007 before increasing to
4.0 per cent in December 2007. Inflation pressures have also
raised concerns in some of the emerging market economies
(EMEs) such as China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Chile.
50. Core CPI inflation in the US increased to 2.4 per cent in
December 2007 from 2.3 per cent in November 2007. In the UK,
core CPI inflation has been declining in tandem with the headline
rate and stood at 1.4 per cent in December, down from 1.5 per cent
in October 2007. In the euro area, core CPI inflation increased
to 1.9 per cent in October-December 2007 from 1.8 per cent in
September 2007. Core inflation in Japan remained negative
(-0.1 per cent) in November-December 2007 as compared with
(-0.3 per cent) in October 2007. Overall, the persistence of high
food prices, oil prices sustained at elevated levels and continued
high prices of other commodities pose significant inflation risks
for the global economy and challenges for monetary policy
worldwide.
51. Globally, inflationary pressures have re-emerged as a key
risk to global growth. In the global foodgrains market, prices of
major crops such as corn, soyabeans and wheat have increased
by 22.4 per cent, 75.2 per cent and 87.7 per cent, respectively,
from a year ago in response to surging demand. The rally has
swept up prices of other food items as well. The increase in prices
has gained momentum from higher energy and fertiliser prices,
low levels of inventories, shortfalls in certain crops mainly caused
by weather-related factors such as the ongoing drought in
Australia and strong increases in the demand for crops. According
to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), 37 countries are
facing food crises due to conflict and disasters. The FAO's global
food price index rose 40 per cent in 2007 to the highest level on
29

record. Food costs in the world's poorest countries _ including
Iraq, Afghanistan, Nepal, Pakistan, and 20 African countries _
rose 25 per cent to US $ 107 billion in 2007.
52. Wheat prices remained generally firm and volatile in
October 2007-January 2008 and reached a record high in
December 2007 on account of repeated downward revisions of
production forecasts in a number of major exporting countries,
most notably Australia. World wheat output is now estimated to
have risen by only 1.3 per cent in 2007. One month wheat futures
at the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) rose from US $ 9.53 per
bushel on October 1, 2007 to US $ 9.74 on December 19, 2007
before falling to US $ 9.36 on January 25, 2008. Trade is
expected to contract because of high and volatile prices, coupled
with soaring freight rates.
53. Strong demand for animal feed as well as for ethanol is
the main driver in global coarse grain markets but supply
tightness in several exporting countries is also providing support
to prices. International prices have declined in recent months but
they still remain well above the previous season's levels. Trade
is expected to increase despite high prices caused by import
demand and shortages of feed wheat that have encouraged
importers to switch to major coarse grains, especially maize and
sorghum. The futures prices of corn on CBOT, which had
moderated somewhat up to July 2007, started moving up
thereafter and reached US $ 5.12 per bushel on January 14, 2008
before declining to US $ 4.99 on January 25, 2008.
54. According to FAO's All Rice Price Index, international rice
prices continued to increase for most of 2007. Rice inventories
in the five major exporting countries indicate that world market
conditions may remain tight in 2008. The futures prices of rice
30

on CBOT rose from US $ 11.71 per hundredweight on October
1, 2007 to US $ 14.53 on January 25, 2008. Sugar prices have
firmed up in recent months due to a shortfall in supply and
expanding investor interest. The futures prices of sugar increased
from US cents 9.93 per pound on October 1, 2007 to US cents
12.45 on January 17, 2008 before declining to US cents 11.94
on January 25, 2008.
55. Metal prices have declined by 8.1 per cent during 2007
after increasing by 53.6 per cent in 2006 and 36.3 per cent in
2005. In the futures markets, aluminium, zinc and lead prices
are showing a downward trend since October 2007. Copper
prices have been buoyed up by the depreciating US dollar and
high demand. Futures price of copper on the New York
Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) increased to a record level of US
$ 3.75 per pound on July 20, 2007 but moderated subsequently
to US $ 3.18 on January 25, 2008. Spot gold rose to US $ 923.73
an ounce on January 25, 2008 _ the highest since January 1980 _
as the dollar fell to a record low against the euro and on concerns
about declining supply on mine shutdowns in South Africa.
56. Prices of crude oil have increased by 69 per cent up to
January 25, 2008 from a year ago and futures prices have
risen to US $ 90.33 per barrel, somewhat lower than the peak
of US $ 99.29 on November 21, 2007 _ the highest since trading
began on the Nymex in 1983. Crude oil prices, which softened
to around US $ 53 per barrel in January 2007, have rebounded
since July 2007 to close at a record level of US $ 99.6 on
January 2, 2008 on account of disturbances in Nigeria before
declining to US $ 90.39 on January 25, 2008 over concerns about
global growth prospects. According to the Energy Information
Administration (EIA), the main drivers of recent oil price
movements are fundamentals such as strong world economic
31

growth, moderate production increase by the OPEC, low spare
production capacity, inventory tightness in developed countries,
worldwide refining bottlenecks, ongoing geopolitical risks and
concerns about supply availability. Continued high demand and
low surplus capacity leave the crude oil scenario vulnerable to
unexpected supply disruptions through 2008. According to the
EIA, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is
expected to be at US $ 87.21 per barrel in 2008 and US $ 81.67
per barrel in 2009.
57. The turbulence in the international financial markets
since July 2007, triggered by massive payment defaults in the
US subprime mortgage market, appears to have deepened in
subsequent months. Payment defaults were felt worldwide by
financial institutions which consequently undertook high write-offs,
with some of the largest international banks recording
considerable declines in profits. These unusual developments
indicated heightened uncertainties and emerging challenges for
the conduct of monetary policy, especially for EMEs.
58.
Concerns about write-offs and uncertainty surrounding the
health of large financial institutions have imparted considerable
volatility in the US equity markets. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average, Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 and Nasdaq Composite
exhibited considerable volatility and posted declines of 2.4 per cent,
6.4 per cent and 4.4 per cent, respectively, by January 25, 2008
over their levels a year ago. On January 21, 2008 equity markets
across the world experienced sharp declines over concerns about
the US slowdown. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average
declined by about 1.0 per cent on the following day, Asian stocks
fell more sharply. Crude oil prices declined to a five-week low
on the Nymex. Confronted by the deep panic in global financial
markets, the US Federal Reserve lowered its policy rates in the
32

inter-meeting period by 75 basis points to 3.50 per cent on
January 22, 2008. The Fed indicated that it has taken the
decision in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and
increasing downside risks to growth. While strains in short-term
funding markets have eased somewhat, broader financial market
conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened
further for some businesses and households. Moreover, incoming
information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as
well as some softening in labour markets. On the same day, the
Bank of Canada reduced its policy rate. Other major central
banks have, however, maintained their rates.
59. Government bond yields in the major economies, which
had until recently firmed up, have softened more recently.
The US 10-year bond yield increased from 4.70 per cent at
end-December 2006 to 5.29 per cent on June 12, 2007 before
falling to 3.56 per cent on January 25, 2008. The 10-year
bond yields in the euro area increased from 3.95 per cent at
end-December 2006 to 4.68 per cent on July 9, 2007 before
falling to 3.97 per cent. The Japanese 10-year bond yield has
increased from 1.68 per cent at end-December 2006 to 1.97
per cent on June 13, 2007 before falling to 1.48 per cent. These
recent developments are indicative of evolving uncertainties in
international financial markets with implications for EMEs.
60. On a trade-weighted basis, the US dollar has been
depreciating since 2006 with intermittent fluctuations. After the
cuts in the Fed funds rates since September 2007, the US dollar
has weakened against other currencies. The pound sterling moved
to the level of US $ 1.98 on January 25, 2008 - lower than the
26-year high of US $ 2.11 reached on November 8, 2007 - amidst
concerns relating to the US subprime mortgage market. The euro,
which has also been strengthening against the US dollar since
June 2007, rose to US $ 1.47 on January 25, 2008, albeit lower
33

than the peak of US $ 1.49 reached on November 26, 2007.
The Canadian dollar appreciated against the US dollar to a
33-year high to reach US $ 1.09 on November 6, 2007 before
declining to US $ 0.99 on January 25, 2008. Turkey experienced
a sharp appreciation in its currency vis-a-vis the US dollar to
reach the level of 86.95 cents on January 10, 2008 before moving
to 84.27 cents on January 25, 2008. The New Zealand dollar
had appreciated to 81.10 cents to reach a 22-year peak against
the US dollar on July 24, 2007 before declining to 76.96 cents
on January 25, 2008.
61. With the beginning of the turbulence, central banks of
advanced economies undertook an increasingly expansive
monetary policy course by cutting policy rates (US Federal Reserve)
and also supplying financial markets with additional liquidity. On
December 12, 2007 the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada,
the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Swiss
National Bank (SNB) announced measures to alleviate elevated
pressures in short-term funding markets. Actions taken by the
Federal Reserve include the establishment of a temporary Term
Auction Facility (TAF) against a wide variety of collateral that
can be used to secure loans at the discount window, and the
establishment of foreign exchange swap lines with the ECB and
the SNB which will provide dollars in amounts of up to US $ 20
billion and US $ 4 billion to the ECB and the SNB, respectively,
for use in their jurisdictions. Four auctions have been conducted
by the US Federal Reserve so far and it may conduct additional
auctions in subsequent months, depending in part on evolving
market conditions. The other four central banks have also
conducted several auctions.
62. During December 2007 and January 2008, the US Federal
Reserve injected about US $ 70 billion (up to January 14, 2008)
34

through three auctions. The ECB provided 648.6 billion euros
through four auctions for 5-16 days; the Bank of England injected
11.35 billion pounds through two auctions; the Bank of Canada
released 4 billion Canadian dollars through two auctions and
the SNB injected US $ 4 billion in one auction. The US Federal
Reserve has announced an auction of US $ 30 billion on January
28, 2008. Since the announcement and subsequent auctions,
pressures in short-term money markets have eased considerably
from their earlier peaks, although spreads have not yet returned
to historical levels.
63. Some central banks have cut policy rates during the third
and fourth quarters of 2007 after financial markets were
significantly affected by turbulence. During September 18, 2007
to January 22, 2008 the US Federal Reserve cut its policy rate
by 175 basis points to 3.50 per cent after seventeen increases
to 5.25 per cent between June 2004 and June 2006. The Bank
of England reduced its repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.50
per cent on December 6, 2007. The Bank of Canada reduced
its rate to 4.0 per cent by two 25 basis points reductions on
December 4, 2007 and January 22, 2008.
64. Central banks of several countries, including the euro area,
New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and Brazil have
not changed their rates in the last quarter of 2007.
65. The central banks that have tightened their policy rates
in recent months include the Reserve Bank of Australia (Cash
Rate raised by 25 basis points in November 2007 to 6.75
per cent); the People's Bank of China (lending rate raised to
7.47 per cent in December 2007 from 7.29 per cent in September
2007); the Banco Central de Chile (benchmark lending rate
raised to 6.25 per cent in January 2008 from 5.75 per cent in
October 2007) and Banco de Mexico (policy rate raised by 25
basis points to 7.50 per cent in October 2007).
35

66. Several central banks that have been confronted with
volatile and large capital flows have employed a variety of
measures to manage and stabilise these flows with a view to
reducing overheating, currency appreciation and the economy's
vulnerability to sharp reversals of flows. A common feature
among the policies adopted by most of them is monetary
tightening involving either hikes in policy rates or hikes in
reserve requirements or both. In China, the required reserve ratio
was raised from 8 per cent in July 2006 to 15 per cent in
January 2008. After a gap of 17 years, the Bank of Korea raised
reserve requirements from 5 per cent to 7 per cent for local
currency deposits and short-term foreign currency deposits in
November and December 2006, respectively. Meanwhile, in
several EMEs including China and Korea, central bank bonds
have continued to absorb liquidity from the banking system.
67. Measures directly aimed at managing capital flows are also
in evidence in many EMEs. On December 18, 2006 Thailand
imposed unremunerated reserve requirements (URR) of 30
per cent on most capital inflows, requiring them to be deposited
with the central bank for one year. These controls have been
substantially relaxed since their inception by (a) providing a fully
hedged option as an alternative to the reserve requirement,
particularly for loans and for investment in fixed income securities
and mutual fund units, and (b) waiving the reserve requirement
on investments in equity-like securities, namely, warrants and
exchange-traded fund units. In addition, regulations on foreign
currency deposit and transfer have been relaxed. In May 2007,
Colombia introduced a package of measures, including a 40
per cent URR on external borrowing to be held for six months in
the central bank. Additionally, a new ceiling on the foreign exchange
position of banks, including gross positions in derivative markets,
was stipulated to limit circumvention of the URR and banks'
36

exposure to counterparty risk. The PBC raised the amount
of foreign currencies that lenders must keep as reserves to
5 per cent from 4 per cent of their foreign-currency deposits from
May 15, 2007. The Bank of Korea is investigating large volume
trading of currency forward contracts by exporters and financial
companies to limit gains in the won, which appreciated to a
10-year high in 2007. Brazil's central bank has bought up substantial
amount of inflows from the spot market to add to reserves and also
conducted sizeable operations in the forward markets.
Overall Assessment
68. Real GDP originating in agriculture and allied activities
has accelerated in the first half of 2007-08 in comparison with
April-September 2006. Advance estimates of kharif output have
been placed somewhat higher than a year ago, which augurs
well for the prospects of growth in agriculture in the third and
also the fourth quarters of 2007-08. The outlook on rabi output
is somewhat mixed and unclear at this juncture. While there has
been some initial slack in rabi sowing, a catch-up appears to be
underway. In the face of shortfalls in the spread and intensity of
North-East monsoon rainfall, reasonable levels of water storage
in major reservoirs across the country provide some cushion
against inclement weather conditions. These developments seem
to confirm the positive outlook for agriculture envisioned in the
Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 and in subsequent
Reviews. By current indications, growth in agriculture in
2007-08 is poised to return to trend.
69. Industrial activity appears to have moderated in the third
quarter of 2007-08 with manufacturing and electricity generation
impacted by 'high base' effects. A positive aspect of industrial
performance is the continuing capacity expansion that is driving
37

growth in manufacturing, supported by electricity generation and
mining activity. Industries such as chemicals and chemical
products, wood and wood products, jute textiles, leather and
leather products and food products recorded acceleration in
April-November, 2007, contributing about 30 per cent of the
growth of overall industrial production. Industries such as basic
metals and alloys, machinery and equipment, transport equipment
and parts which together contributed over 30 per cent of industrial
production are set to catch up although, on a cumulative basis,
their growth rates appear somewhat moderated in relation to a
year ago. There are downside risks emanating from high
international crude prices, rising input costs and the uncertain
global environment wherein the possibility of some slowdown in
economic activity and, consequently, in export demand seems
to be gaining ground. Under the circumstances and recognising
that the high base effects may be reflected in the relevant indices,
moderation in the rate of industrial growth over the remaining
part of 2007-08 needs to be reckoned. On balance, assuming
that there are no exogenous shocks, either global or domestic,
the prospects for the industrial sector over the rest of 2007-08
remain reasonably positive at this juncture.
70.
In the services sector, all constituent sub-sectors except
community, social and personal services have recorded double-digit
growth in the first half of 2007-08. The outlook for the services
sector has improved with lead indicators such as the growth in
railway revenue earning freight traffic, sales of passenger and
commercial vehicles, cargo handled at major ports, telephone
connections, tourist arrivals and civil aviation traffic indicating a
pick-up in the pace of growth of transport and communication
services in coming months. Headline indicators also suggest
continuing high growth in financial and business services while
construction activity is expected to continue to expand strongly
38

on the back of investment demand. On the other hand, activity
relating to trade, hotels and restaurants and community, social
and personal services has recorded some slackening in the
second quarter of 2007-08. On balance, therefore, the prospects
for services continue to be favourable at this juncture; however,
uncertainties surrounding the evolution of global developments
cloud the outlook as noted in the Mid-Term Review of October 2007.
71. Key indicators point to the persistence of aggregate
demand pressures, including into the near-term. First, the
disposition of GDP by expenditure in the first half of 2007-08
indicates that there has been a distinct step-up in fixed capital
formation as a proportion to GDP at constant market prices. On
the other hand, private final consumption expenditure has
moderated. The strength of investment demand is also reflected
in the growth of capital goods production - at its highest for
April-November since 1993-94 - the continuing high growth in
imports of capital goods and the increase in intermediate goods
production - highest for April-November since 1995-96. The
sustained pace of construction activity is also reflective of the
driving force of investment demand. Furthermore, resources raised
through public issues have increased sizeably. Second, since
the time of the Mid-Term Review, both reserve money and money
supply have accelerated, reflecting the significant expansionary
effects of large capital inflows embodied in the Reserve Bank's
foreign currency assets (adjusted for revaluation) being 289 per cent
higher than the increase in the corresponding period of the
previous year. Non-food credit, which had been slowing down
in the first half of 2007-08, appears to have picked up, which
may restrain any slowdown in aggregate deposit growth that has
been running well above indicative projections throughout 2007-08
so far. Third, with non-oil imports recording a sharp acceleration
in growth in October and November, the merchandise trade deficit
39

has expanded in spite of the pace of export growth, pointing to
the pressure from domestic demand. Fourth, inflation in terms of
wholesale prices, has started to rise since December after a
prolonged trough beginning in mid-July 2007. With the wholesale
prices of key food articles firming up in recent weeks along with
prices of some manufactures, further softening of inflation in terms
of consumer prices may not accrue, going forward. Fifth, the
incomplete pass-through of the indeterminate permanent
component of the increase in international oil prices is indicative
of potential upward pressure on inflation. Finally, escalated and
volatile levels of equity, gold and real estate prices are visibly
reflecting the strain imposed by aggregate demand conditions.
72. Headline WPI inflation has been edging up moderately since
early December 2007, coming out of the mid-October-end-November
trough that started to form in mid-July. The upturn is largely
attributable to the onset of base effects that could prevail up to
mid-February 2008. The main contributors to the recent rise in
headline inflation are milk, rice, raw cotton and oilseeds in the
primary articles category, non-administered petroleum products
in the fuel group and edible oil, oilcakes, iron and steel, cement,
drugs and medicines and electrical machinery in the category
of manufactured products which together accounted for nearly
100 per cent of WPI inflation. Consumer prices continue to rule
at elevated levels, despite some softening in the third quarter of
2007-08.
73. It is important to note that indications are getting stronger of
upside inflationary risks in the period ahead. First, exclusion-based
measures, i.e., WPI excluding food and energy, place inflation
higher than the headline, indicative of the underlying aggregate
demand pressures. Second, disaggregated analysis suggests that
the favourable effects of the cuts in petrol/diesel prices in 2006-07,
40

which facilitated benign inflation conditions over the greater part
of 2007-08, have ceased since December 2007. Prices of
non-administered petroleum products (naphtha, furnace oil,
aviation fuel and the like) have increased in the range of 28-37
per cent. Accordingly, fuel prices, even if unchanged, are set to
drive up headline inflation going forward, in contrast to their
dampening role hitherto. In view of the new highs to which
international crude prices have recently been lifted, the threats
to domestic price stability have risen and turned extremely
volatile, representing a serious risk to inflation expectations. It is
difficult to differentiate, ex ante, the permanent and temporary
components of the elevated international crude prices but, in any
case, at current levels, it is necessary to recognise the need for
some more pass-through from international crude prices and
implications for domestic inflation conditions.
74. The softening of inflation in terms of manufactures through
the year and primary food articles since mid-July 2007 is
increasingly becoming vulnerable to the adverse global
developments in the period ahead. International foodgrain prices,
which have escalated to historic peaks, are poised to enter a
prolonged period of hardening, with demand projected to run well
ahead of supply and historically low stocks, exacerbated by
bio-fuel diversion. The weighted average price paid on wheat
import tenders during June-November 2007 were significantly
higher than a year ago. In the primary non-food category, the
upside inflation risks emanating from the oilseeds/edible oil group
have increased substantially, both domestically and globally. The
outlook on international metal prices remains uncertain with
demand pressures from Asia continuing to be sustained by robust
growth in the region.
75. While CPI inflation has moderated by about 200 basis
points between August and November due to the easing of food
41

price inflation, this could be a short-lived phenomenon in view
of the uncertainty surrounding rabi output and the deteriorating
international environment. Furthermore, domestic monetary and
liquidity conditions continue to be more expansionary than before
and are likely to be amplified by global factors, particularly, the
recent massive injections of liquidity by major central banks to
activate frozen money markets. It is also necessary to recognise
that despite the turmoil in international financial markets, asset
prices continue to rule at escalated levels, fuelled by the
abundance of liquidity.
76. A sizeable swing in liquidity was experienced towards the
middle of the third quarter of 2007-08. With the 50 basis point
increase in the CRR announced in the Mid-Term Review
becoming effective from November 10, 2007 and aided by
festival demand for cash, a build-up of the Government's cash
balances and advance tax outflows, the large daily LAF reverse
repo absorptions that characterised August-October 2007,
ceased. Daily injections through the LAF repos commenced
through November 2007-December 2007 with brief interruptions
and reversion to the absorption mode in the last week of
December 2007 and early January 2008. Liquidity injections
reached a peak on December 26, 2007. The Central
Government's cash balances exhibited a generally unidirectional
upward movement, rising to a peak on December 22, 2007
coincident with advance tax payments, and further constricted
liquidity although in the following weeks these balances have
been drawn down, augmenting market liquidity. In view of the
liquidity conditions, maturing securities under the MSS were
allowed to be redeemed during November 23, 2007 to
January 11, 2008. Notwithstanding these contrasting movements
in components, there was a large increase in the total overhang
of liquidity (LAF, MSS and Government cash balances taken
42

together) over the third quarter of 2007-08, reflecting the sizeable
expansion in primary liquidity generated by the large accretions
to the Reserve Bank's net foreign assets. The banking system
generally remained in surplus mode with large investments in
mutual funds and a moderate increase in excess SLR holdings
in comparison to a year ago.
77. Overnight money market rates, which were hovering
around the LAF reverse repo rate till November 11, 2007 rose
thereafter to rule around the repo rate up to end-December, before
easing again to reverse repo rate levels in January 2008 with
the resumption of surplus liquidity conditions, barring some spikes
in the second half of the month. A notable feature is the muted
impact of mid-December advance tax outflows on money markets
indicative of the success of active monetary and liquidity
management. In the foreign exchange market, large inflows have
imposed persistent upward pressures on the exchange rate of
the rupee which have become accentuated in the wake of cuts
in the US Federal Funds target rate over September 2007January 22, 2008. In the Government securities market, orderly
conditions have prevailed through the quarter with yields
declining across all maturities.
78. There has been some improvement in the finances of the
Central Government during April-November 2007. On the revenue
account, there has been a strong growth in non-tax revenues in
the form of interest receipts which has supported the underlying
buoyancy of tax revenues. Some moderation in the growth of
revenue expenditures has been enabled by a slower growth of
non-Plan spending. Accordingly, there has been a decline in the
revenue deficit in absolute terms on a year-on-year basis. Higher
interest receipts have also enabled a gross primary surplus in
contrast to a deficit in the corresponding period of the previous
43

year. Higher allocations to States and Union Territories, transport
and highways, rural development and health were the principal
forces driving up Plan expenditure. While capital expenditure (net
of transactions related to the transfer of the Reserve Bank's stake
in the SBI) was moderately higher than a year ago, it has
remained lower as a proportion to budget estimates, and the
expansion in capital outlay remains modest. The gross fiscal
deficit has declined in absolute terms as well as in terms of its
proportion to the budget estimates, indicating that adherence to
the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) rules
in the current financial year is on track.
79. There are indications of some changes underway in India's
external sector developments which carry implications for the
period ahead. First, there has been a widening of the trade deficit
in the first half of 2007-08 on account of the sustained demand
for non-oil imports - particularly for capital goods, export-related
inputs and bullion - notwithstanding the moderation in the quantity
of PoL imports. Second, the sources of growth driving invisible
receipts appear to be changing. While there was some
deceleration in exports of software and business services in the
first half of 2007-08, remittances from Indians working overseas
and investment income receipts associated with the deployment
of foreign exchange reserves have increased sharply, more than
compensating for the slack in software export growth and
enabling a higher invisible surplus than a year ago. Accordingly,
the current account deficit during April-September 2007 remained
broadly at the same level as a year ago as a proportion to GDP.
Third, net capital flows have risen nearly three-fold and all
categories, barring non-resident deposits, have recorded sizeable
increases. Net FDI inflows have accelerated, preferring
manufacturing, business and computer services. Outward FDI has
more than doubled, reflecting the growing global reach of the
44

Indian corporate sector. Net inflows on account of external
commercial borrowings and short_term trade credits have also
gone up sizeably. Fourth, while the accretion to reserves during
the current financial year has been unprecedented by historical
standards, from the national balance sheet perspective, India's
international liabilities at US $ 322 billion at book value at
end-June 2007 were substantially in excess of the foreign
exchange reserves and this gap has widened at end-December
2007 with net capital flows set to exceed the level of 5 per cent
of GDP recorded in 2006-07.
80. Developments in global financial markets since the Mid-Term
Review of October 2007 present several issues that need to
be monitored carefully in the context of the implications for
EMEs. First, alongside inter-bank term interest rates, corporate
credit spreads and those on mortgage-backed securities have
widened since early October as concerns relating to the
possibility of prolonged disruption to credit intermediation have
deepened. In the credit markets, investors are increasingly
demanding risk premia for product complexity and exposure to
asset-backed commercial papers (ABCPs) and structured
investment vehicles (SIVs). Second, the impact of the recent
financial market turmoil has been sizeable on banks, particularly
internationally active banks from both sides of the Atlantic.
Several large banks have already recognised substantial losses
on holdings of collaterailised debt obligations (CDOs),
mortgage-backed leveraged products and the picture continues
to unfold. Market perceptions of increasing systemic risk in the
banking system are being reflected in declines in bank share
prices, a sharp increase in spreads on credit default swap (CDS)
and growing concerns relating to off-balance sheet positions.
Third, as pointed out in the Mid-Term Review, the responses of
45

central banks to recent events have demonstrated that ensuring
financial stability can, under certain circumstances, assume
overriding importance relative to other more explicitly pursued goals.
81. Global macroeconomic prospects in the near-to-medium
term are expected to be influenced by the rebalancing that has
been underway over the last few years towards Europe, Japan
and the EMEs. In this context, the role of EMEs in supporting
the global economy and in cushioning global downturns is
conditioned by the environment for decoupling from the US. It is
important to recognise that the extent of decoupling will depend
on the impact of developments in the financial sector in general
and real sector developments in the US economy in particular.
First, in the near-term, EMEs face risks from tightening of credit
standards in advanced economies. Second, dependence on
imports and higher energy intensity of output may make EMEs
more exposed to inflation shocks. Third, international financial
markets respond differently to the same macroeconomic or
political development depending on whether it is an EME or an
advanced economy. Hence, EMEs have to follow a more
pragmatic and contextual policy. Fourth, the self-correcting
mechanisms in financial markets happen to operate more
efficiently in advanced economies and far less efficiently in the
EMEs, particularly during highly uncertain global economic
conditions. Hence, the extent of or lack of self-correcting
mechanisms in an economy should be treated as given, in the
short_term, and a suitable policy of intervention has to be pursued
accordingly. Fifth, real sector flexibilities may be far less in EMEs.
Hence, the real sector responses to exchange rate movements
are not likely to be as flexible as in the advanced economies.
Sixth, the distinction between flexibility and volatility in the context
46

of financial markets in EMEs has to be based on the
preparedness of the markets and the market participants. It is in
this context that the decoupling of EMEs from the US remains to
be tested.
82. There are indications of significant changes in the global
macroeconomic and financial environment in the fourth quarter
of 2007 that could have a bearing on the outlook for growth and
inflation. Financing conditions in a number of major economies
have tightened. There are also growing concerns relating to the
vulnerability of the banking system to potential losses, the true
magnitude of which is still unknown, and the associated
systemic risks. Conditions in the US housing sector have
worsened. A sharp depreciation in the US dollar and soaring
crude prices are other factors that have produced shifts in the
balance of risks to the global economy. In recent months, forwardlooking indicators, including global purchasing managers' indices
and consumer and business confidence, have deteriorated in
major industrial economies. Consensus forecasts so far indicate
a slowing of the global economy in 2007 and 2008 with risks
currently seen as weighed to the downside. So far, spillovers
from the credit markets to the real economy have been small,
except for some retrenchment in consumer spending. There are,
however, risks of exogenous shocks such as a disruptive decline
in the US dollar. Forecasts for other advanced economies have
been pared and the US subprime crisis, food and crude prices
pose the gravest risks.
83. Headline inflation has trended up in the US, the euro area,
Japan and China in November 2007. The recent sharp rise in
commodity prices has added uncertainty to global inflation
prospects. Food prices are pushing up inflation in many EMEs
47

and are expected to remain high over the medium-term. Higher
oil prices pose the risk of aggravating inflation risks directly as
well as through the demand for oil substitutes which, in turn,
contributes to the rise in food prices. Wage pressures in the
context of strong labour market conditions are posing inflation
risks in advanced and emerging economies across the world, in
conjunction with higher input costs. Overall, inflationary pressures
have firmed up with implications for the outlook for 2008.
84. In the overall assessment, the domestic outlook remains
positive with continued favourable prospects of sustaining the
growth momentum in an environment of price and financial
stability. There are some indications of moderation in industrial
production, corporate sales and profitability, business confidence
and non-food credit. Domestic activity continues to be investment
driven, supported by external demand. Building up of supply
capacities, both new and existing, is strongly underway as
reflected in the sustained demand for domestic and imported
capital goods. Monetary and financial conditions as well as asset
prices are reflecting these expansionary impulses. The external
sector developments are dominated by the extraordinarily large
capital flows, to a considerable extent reflecting sustained
international investor confidence in India. In contrast to domestic
prospects, the outlook for the global economy has worsened
somewhat from the time of the Mid-Term Review with risks to
both growth and inflation having accentuated. While the dangers
of global recession are relatively subdued at the current juncture
and consensus expectations seem to support a soft landing, the
upside pressures on inflation have become more potent and real
than before. Food and energy prices are set to impart a
permanent upward shock to inflation globally and, in particular,
in EMEs. The future evolution of the subprime mortgage crisis
carries by far the gravest risks for the world economy. For EMEs
48

in particular, the probability attached to tail risks has, in fact,
increased over recent months as information is getting revealed
on the extent of contaminated financial assets and the extent of
contagion. Several EMEs are likely to face the dilemma of
responding to slackening of growth induced by global
developments even as inflationary pressures remain firm.
Furthermore, the overarching objective of ensuring financial
stability would pose a testing challenge for the conduct of
monetary policy in the period ahead.

II. Stance of Monetary Policy
85. The Mid-Term Review noted that at this stage of
development of the Indian economy, the formulation of monetary
policy has to be acutely sensitive to the impact of excessive
market volatility on the real sector with feedback effects on the
financial sector, particularly in view of the limited room for
manoeuvre for fiscal policy. On the domestic front, it was indicated
that risks to inflation and inflation expectations would continue
to demand priority in policy monitoring, with the biggest challenge
being the management of capital flows and the attendant
implications for liquidity and overall stability, especially in the
context of the rapid escalation in asset prices driven by capital
flows. Threats to inflation were also seen as emanating from
global factors _ injection of liquidity by central banks; the high
and volatile levels of international commodity prices; and the
sharp increase in inflation in China.
86. Against this backdrop, the Mid-Term Review persisted with
the stance set out in the Annual Policy Statement for 2007-08 and
the First Quarter Review of reinforcing the emphasis on price
stability and well-anchored inflation expectations while ensuring
a monetary and interest rate environment that supports export
49

and investment demand in the economy so as to enable
continuation of the growth momentum. Credit quality and orderly
conditions in financial markets for securing macroeconomic and,
in particular, financial stability were re-emphasised while
simultaneously pursuing greater credit penetration and financial
inclusion. While reiterating a readiness to respond swiftly with
all possible measures as appropriate to the evolving global and
domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations, financial
stability and the growth momentum, the Mid-Term Review
resolved to take recourse to all possible options for maintaining
stability and the growth momentum in the economy in view of
the unusually heightened global uncertainties, and the
unconventional policy responses to the developments in financial
markets.
87. The unfolding of global developments in recent weeks and
the responses of monetary authorities provide an indication of
the threat to growth and financial stability worldwide, bearing out
the Reserve Bank's stance of enhanced vigilance to be able to
respond appropriately to global financial and monetary conditions.
In addition, risks to inflation from high and volatile international
prices of fuel, food and metal prices appear to have intensified.
Consumer price inflation has hardened in a number of countries,
complicating the task of monetary authorities in assuaging liquidity
and solvency stress in financial markets and institutions.
Domestically, managing the expansionary effects of large capital
inflows on liquidity, monetary aggregates and asset prices has
posed a testing challenge for the conduct of monetary policy.
With the 50 basis point increase in the CRR announced in the
Mid-Term Review coming into effect from November 10, 2007
the strategy of active liquidity management with a combination
of measures has been successful in managing overall liquidity
conditions consistent with the policy stance. Overnight interest
50

rates rose to the upper reaches of the LAF corridor in an orderly
manner up to December 2007, followed by some intermittent
softening in January 2008 as surplus liquidity conditions
resumed. Nevertheless, financial markets continue to warrant
careful and continuous monitoring with a readiness to respond
flexibly and pre-emptively to ensure orderly liquidity conditions,
particularly in the context of the management of volatile and large
movements in capital flows.
88. On balance, the prospects for the domestic economy over
the remaining part of 2007-08 are consistent with policy
expectations. First, there has been a modest deceleration in
output growth in the second and third quarters. Second,
aggregate supply conditions have continued to expand in all
constituent sectors and the ongoing investment boom should
entrench the improvement in supply elasticities, going forward.
Third, corporate profitability and business confidence continue
to be sustained by the underlying macroeconomic fundamentals,
positive sentiment in financial markets and resilient export
demand, especially in view of the global economic and financial
environment. Fourth, inflation has so far been within tolerance
thresholds at the wholesale level. Fifth, prudential and profitability
indicators suggest that banks' balance sheets have become
stronger and sounder than before. Sixth, domestic financial
markets have been orderly and insulated so far from the turmoil
in global markets on account of the subprime crisis though there
has been unusual volatility in equity markets that is to some
extent influenced by global developments. Seventh, in the
external sector, the current account deficit remains well within
sustainable limits, with net invisible surpluses offsetting the
merchandise trade deficit to a considerable degree. Accordingly,
the build-up in the foreign exchange reserves during the current
financial year has been historically unprecedented. On the other
51

hand, the expansion of monetary and liquidity conditions as well
as asset prices contain risks of upward inflationary pressures for
the Indian economy, alongside international price pressures
particularly on account of oil and food prices. Most importantly,
in the period ahead, developments in global financial markets in
the context of the subprime crisis would warrant more intensified
monitoring and swift responses with all available instruments to
preserve and maintain macroeconomic and financial stability.
89. Real GDP originating in agriculture and allied activities
has recorded above-trend growth in the first half of 2007-08 with
kharif foodgrains production placed higher than in the preceding
year. More information will be necessary to make a full and
realistic assessment of rabi production, including the extent to
which reservoir storage will have a mitigating effect on shortfalls
in the winter North-East monsoon. On the other hand, industrial
activity appears to be experiencing some transient and cyclical
effects affecting manufacturing performance. With the momentum
of growth in the services sector expected to be sustained,
drawing from leading indicators, the projection of overall real
GDP growth in 2007-08 is maintained at around 8.5 per cent for
policy purposes, assuming no further escalation in international
crude prices and barring domestic or external shocks.
90. Headline inflation has picked up since the beginning of
December 2007 with attendant implications at the retail/consumer
level. While this is largely attributable to base effects that may
extend up to February 2008, escalated and volatile international
crude prices and the heightened levels of food prices pose clear
and present risks to the inflation outlook at the current juncture,
especially if and when some pass-through to domestic petroleum
product prices becomes inevitable. In the overall assessment, in
view of the lagged and cumulative effects of monetary policy on
aggregate demand and assuming ongoing improvement in supply
52

management, capital flows would be managed actively and in
the absence of shocks emanating in the domestic or global
economy, the policy endeavour would be to contain inflation close
to 5.0 per cent in 2007-08. In recognition of India's evolving
integration with the global economy and societal preferences in
this regard, the resolve, going forward, would be to condition
expectations in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent so that an inflation
rate of around 3.0 per cent becomes a medium-term objective
consistent with India's broader integration into the global
economy.
91. The rate of money supply has picked up since the Mid-Term
Review of October 2007, coincident with a jump in the growth of
reserve money over this period, driven by the accretion to the
Reserve Bank's foreign exchange assets. This has been reflected
in the acceleration in the growth of banks' aggregate deposits
driven by cyclical factors in the upturn. Over the greater part of
2007-08, deposit growth has been running ahead of the projection
of Rs.4,90,000 crore for 2007-08 as a whole, mainly driven by
aggressive rate setting behaviour of banks. Non-food credit
(inclusive of non-SLR investments), although below the projected
growth of 24.0-25.0 per cent given in the Annual Policy Statement,
has been picking up since mid-August 2007. Moderating money
supply in alignment with the indicative projections of 17.0-17.5
per cent set out in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2007
may warrant appropriate responses, given the considerations for
ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability going forward.
92. At the current juncture, global uncertainties have increased
considerably in the context of the downside risks to growth and
financial stability. Global financial markets continue to experience
unusual volatility, strained liquidity and credit conditions as well
as heightened risk aversion. While these pressures have been
sought to be addressed through coordinated actions by several
53

leading central banks, the impact and outcomes of these recent
actions of monetary authorities still appear unclear for the
near-term outlook for financial markets and for the longer term
on the real economy in terms of growth and stability. Some major
central banks have engaged in lowering policy rates _ sizeably
in January 2008 even by historical standards _ in view of the
weakening economic outlook and the continuing deterioration in
broader financial market conditions, in spite of the judgement that
it will be necessary to monitor inflation developments carefully.
93. Recent global events were not entirely unanticipated, as
already articulated in previous monetary policy statements, but
the intensity appears to be severe and the duration uncertain. It
appears that a process of reordering of global economic balances
is underway and hence, the process is likely to continue to be
complex with significant implications for trade flows, financial
flows, asset prices and balance sheets. In terms of the impact
of such a process on India, our external trade is, relative to many
other EMEs, well diversified. Similarly, on a systemic basis, most
parts of the balance sheets of both the public sector and the
private sector are relatively less exposed to foreign currencies.
However, more recently, several large corporates have expanded
their foreign currency exposures which have to be managed
carefully. The major source of impact is through the financial
flows, in particular, in the equity markets and, consequently, on
the foreign exchange market in India. The second order effects
on account of financial contagion or real sector developments
are somewhat indeterminate at this stage.
94. In view of the risks associated with international financial
developments impacting balance sheets of corporates with
sizeable external liabilities, banks are urged to review large
foreign currency exposures and to put in place a system for
monitoring such unhedged exposures on a regular basis so as
54

to minimise risks of instability in the financial system under the
current highly uncertain conditions. Internal limits as deemed
appropriate may be made applicable for foreign currency loans
on the basis of a well laid out policy approved by banks' boards.
Banks are also urged to carefully monitor corporate activity in
terms of treasury/trading activity and sources of other income to
the extent that embedded credit/market risks pose potential
impairment to the quality of banks' assets.
95. In the context of a more open capital account and the size
of inflows currently, public policy preference for a hierarchy of
capital flows with a priority for more stable components could
necessitate a more holistic approach, combining sectoral
regulations with broader measures to enhance the quality of flows
and make the source of flows transparent. In this context, it is
critical for public policy to effectively, demonstrably and
convincingly indicate commitment to managing capital flows
consistent with macro fundamentals through appropriate and
decisive policy actions.
96. While the focus has generally been on managing the
excess capital inflows and volatility in regard to the excess, it is
essential not to exclude the possibility of some change in course,
due to any abrupt changes in sentiments or global liquidity
conditions, despite strong underlying fundamentals of the Indian
economy. Events in the second and third week of January 2008
indicate a potential for reversal in capital flows, though it is not
yet clear how transient such events will turn out to be. Strategic
management of the capital account would warrant preparedness
for all situations, and the challenges for managing the capital
account in such an unexpected turn of events may be quite different.
97. The setting of monetary policy in India has been rendered
complex in the light of these developments. On the one hand,
55

the underlying fundamentals of the economy remain strong and
resilient and the outlook continues to be positive. At the same
time, while there is no visible or immediate threat to financial
stability in India from global developments, the need for continued
but heightened vigilance has increased with an emphasis on
readiness to take timely, prompt and appropriate measures to
mitigate the risks to the extent possible. As noted in the Mid-Term
Review, the immediate task for public policy in India is to manage
the possible financial contagion that seems to have highly
uncertain prospects of being resolved soon. Accordingly,
monetary policy has to be vigilant and proactive in cushioning
the real economy from excess volatility in financial markets while
recognising that India cannot be totally immune to global
developments.
98. The developments in the domestic economy are broadly
in line with the policy expectations and in the normal course
would not warrant any significant monetary policy initiatives at
this juncture. However, moderation in the growth of the industrial
sector may need further exploring to assess whether some of
the segments are reflecting correction of the excesses in the
previous years or whether there are sector-specific factors which
require attention. While growth in investment demand is likely to
ease the supply constraints in future by adding to capacities, the
moderation in private consumption expenditure warrants
consideration. Such a disaggregated analysis of supply and
demand factors across select sectors would enable appropriate
public policy responses keeping in view the employment intensity
of some of these sectors. Monetary policy, per se, can essentially
address issues relating to aggregate demand but the associated
policies in the financial sector could, to the extent possible, take
account of the evolving circumstances as reflected in the
disaggregated analysis. In view of the prevailing liquidity
conditions and the sustained profitability of banks as reflected in
56

net interest margins, there is a need for banks to undertake
institutional and procedural changes for enhancing credit delivery
to sectors that are employment-intensive.
99. Over the period ahead, liquidity management will continue
to assume priority in the conduct of monetary policy. Liquidity
conditions are being shaped by several underlying factors which
appear to exert conflicting pulls and pose challenges for
designing the appropriate policy response. First, money supply
has been expanding well above indicative projections in 2007-08
driven up by high deposit growth despite successive increases
in the CRR with no remuneration. Expansionary liquidity
conditions engendered by capital flows, have not, however,
prompted banks to reduce deposit/lending rates which have been
broadly maintained at the elevated levels of the preceding year.
Consequently, effective interest rates on time deposits at the
margin are currently ruling above the LAF repo rate. Apparently,
there have been little or no adverse effects on banks' net interest
margins and profitability has remained high, boosted by operating
income. Notwithstanding the surplus liquidity conditions, bank
credit growth has moderated. Despite comfortable liquidity
conditions, banks have not expanded credit proportionately;
instead, banks have preferred to make excess investments in
SLR securities including MSS issuances, money market mutual
funds and the LAF reverse repo, despite earning apparently lower
interest rates thereon. Furthermore, reflecting the continuing
uncertainty in global financial markets, significant volatility has
also been observed in the Indian capital markets with the
associated impact on liquidity. These developments have
implications for liquidity management going forward and warrant
appropriate and timely action.
100. The Reserve Bank will continue with its policy of active
demand management of liquidity through appropriate use of the
57

CRR stipulations and open market operations (OMO) including
the MSS and the LAF, using all the policy instruments at its
disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants.
101. For the purpose of formulating the stance of monetary
policy, domestic factors, which are better balanced, stable and
remain positive, dominate while global factors are reckoned to
be increasingly relevant. In sum, barring the emergence of any
adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the
economy and keeping in view the current assessment of the
economy including the outlook for growth and inflation, the overall
stance of monetary policy in the period ahead will broadly
continue to be:
O

To reinforce the emphasis on price stability and wellanchored inflation expectations while ensuring a
monetary and interest rate environment conducive to
continuation of the growth momentum and orderly
conditions in financial markets.

O

To emphasise credit quality as well as credit delivery,
in particular, for employment-intensive sectors, while
pursuing financial inclusion.

O

To monitor the evolving heightened global uncertainties
and domestic situation impinging on inflation
expectations, financial stability and growth momentum
in order to respond swiftly with both conventional and
unconventional measures, as appropriate.

58

III. Monetary Measures
(a)

Bank Rate

102. The Bank Rate has been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent.
(b)

Repo Rate/Reverse Repo Rate

103. The repo rate under the LAF is kept unchanged at 7.75
per cent.
104. The reverse repo rate under the LAF is kept unchanged
at 6.0 per cent.
105. The Reserve Bank has the flexibility to conduct repo/
reverse repo auctions at a fixed rate or at variable rates as
circumstances warrant.
106. The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight
or longer term repo/reverse repo under the LAF depending on
market conditions and other relevant factors. The Reserve Bank
will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or
reject tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit,
so as to make efficient use of the LAF in daily liquidity
management.
(c)

Cash Reserve Ratio

107. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks is
currently at 7.5 per cent. On a review of the current liquidity
situation, it is considered desirable to keep the present level of
the CRR at 7.5 per cent unchanged.
108. The Annual Policy Statement for the year 2008-09 will be
announced on April 29, 2008.
