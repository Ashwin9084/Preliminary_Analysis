Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2011-12
By
Dr. D. Subbarao
Governor
Introduction

even though this was caused largely by
a seasonal decline in vegetable prices.
Consistent with the Reserve Bank’s
earlier projections, inflation is likely to
decelerate further to 7 per cent by March
2012.

Since the Second Quarter Review
(SQR) of Monetary Policy in October
2011, there have been significant changes
in the global scenario. On the one hand,
concerns over the sustainability of
sovereign debt problem in the euro area
have intensified. On the other, there are
modest signs of improvement in the
US. In the emerging and developing
economies (EDEs), growth has been
moderating, reflecting the sluggishness
in the advanced economies and the
impact of earlier monetary tightening.
Overall, notwithstanding the signs
of recovery in the US, global growth
prospects have weakened since the SQR.

4.
Non-food manufactured products
inflation, however, continues to remain
high and well above the comfort zone.
While indicators of pricing power
suggest that the moderating trend will
continue, upside risks remain significant.
The momentum indicator of non-food
manufactured products inflation is yet
to show a discernible downward trend.
Accordingly, while the Reserve Bank’s
policy stance has to become more
sensitive to growth risks, it also needs to
guard against persistent inflation risks.

2.
Growth in India has also
moderated. In particular, investment
activity has decelerated sharply,
reflecting heightened global uncertainty
and domestic fiscal, monetary, political
and administrative conditions.

5.
This policy review is set in the
context of a highly uncertain global
environment and a delicately poised
domestic balance between growth
and inflation. It should be read and
understood together with the detailed
review in Macroeconomic and Monetary
Developments released yesterday by the
Reserve Bank.

3.
Inflation is beginning to moderate
as projected, despite the significant
depreciation of the rupee. In particular,
the higher than expected deceleration in
food inflation has provided some relief,

macroeconomic developments;

Global Economy

9.
The global purchasing managers’
index (PMI) for manufacturing recovered
to an expansionary mode in December
after remaining below the benchmark
50-mark (suggesting contraction) in
both October and November 2011.
The services index remains above the
50-mark (suggesting expansion) and
improved from 52.7 in November to
53.2 in December. The composite PMI
of the euro area has remained well below
the benchmark of 50 since September
2011, although the index improved
marginally to 48.3 in December from
47.0 in November.

7.
US GDP growth in Q3 of 2011
[quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), seasonally
adjusted annualised rate (saar)] was
revised downwards from 2 per cent to
1.8 per cent. Although this is better than
the sub-one per cent growth in the first
half of 2011, it is still substantially below
trend. In the euro area, GDP growth
(q-o-q, saar) decelerated from 0.8 per
cent in Q2 to 0.4 per cent in Q3. In Japan,
growth (q-o-q, saar) recovered to 5.6 per
cent in Q3 from the setbacks suffered in
Q2 (-2.0 per cent) and Q1 (-6.6 per cent)
due to earthquake/tsunami.
8.
Amongst the major EDEs,
growth [year-on-year (y-o-y)] in China
slowed to 8.9 per cent in Q4 of 2011 from
9.1 per cent in Q3 and 9.5 per cent in Q2;
it also slowed in Brazil to 2.1 per cent in
Q3 from 3.3 per cent in Q2 and in South
Africa to 3.1 per cent from 3.2 per cent.
Growth in Russia, however, accelerated
to 4.8 per cent in Q3 from 3.4 per cent
in Q2 of 2011. Various international
agencies have scaled down their growth
estimate for 2011 and projection for 2012
both for the advanced economies and
EDEs.

10.
Beginning the fourth week of
December 2011, increase in international
crude oil prices has been driven largely
by geo-political uncertainties. In contrast,
weak global economic activity has led to
some softening of non-oil commodity
prices. The World Bank’s index of nonenergy prices declined by 11 per cent
(y-o-y) in December 2011.
11.
Reflecting international
commodity price dynamics, headline
measures of inflation moderated in
2

(April-September) of 2011-12 slowed
to 7.3 per cent from 8.6 per cent in H1
of last year.

November-December 2011 in a number
of countries, but still remain at elevated
levels. Among the major advanced
economies, headline inflation was 3.0
per cent in the US and 2.7 per cent
in the euro area. Amongst the EDEs,
headline inflation was 4.1 per cent in
China, 6.5 per cent in Brazil and 6.1
per cent in Russia and South Africa.
Notably, in many EDEs, the softening, in
varying degrees, of the impact of global
commodity prices on inflation was offset
by the sizeable depreciation of their
currencies in the second half of 2011.

14.
On the demand side, the
contraction in fixed capital formation
in Q2 was the main factor behind the
slowdown in growth. The real gross
fixed capital formation to GDP ratio
declined from 31.2 per cent in Q1 to 30.5
per cent in Q2. This pattern, should it
persist, will hurt medium-term growth.
Private consumption grew by 5.9 per
cent in Q2, slightly slower than 6.3 per
cent in Q1, but substantially slower
than 9.0 per cent a year ago. The global
environment is only partly responsible
for the weak industrial performance and
sluggish investment activity; several
domestic factors – the unhealthy fiscal
situation, high interest rates and policy
and administrative uncertainty – are also
playing a role.

12.
Given the renewed strains in
global financial markets, six major
central banks announced coordinated
actions in November 2011 to enhance
their capacity to provide liquidity
support to the global financial system.
The European Central Bank (ECB)
also announced longer-term refinancing
operations (LTROs) with a maturity of
36 months. These measures are intended
to encourage bank lending in money
markets and sovereign bond markets.

15.
The index of industrial production
(IIP) remained volatile. The y-o-y
industrial growth recovered from
(-) 4.7 per cent in October to 5.9 per cent
in November. Over the year, however,
growth in industrial production slowed
down to 3.8 per cent during AprilNovember 2011 from 8.4 per cent a
year ago. The slowdown was mainly
on account of the manufacturing and
mining sectors. In terms of the usebased classification, weakness in the
capital goods, intermediate goods and
consumer durables sectors dragged

Domestic Economy
13.
At home, GDP growth moderated
from 7.7 per cent in Q1 (April-June)
to 6.9 per cent in Q2 (July-September)
of 2011-12. This was mainly due to
deceleration in industrial growth from
6.7 per cent to 2.8 per cent. However, the
services sector held up relatively well.
Consequently, GDP growth during H1
3

years from September 2009 to October
2011, moderated to 8.5 per cent in
November and further to 3.1 per cent
in December. This was essentially on
account of vegetables and non-food
articles, particularly, fibres. However,
inflation in protein items – ‘eggs, fish
and meat’, milk and pulses – remained
in double digits. Excluding vegetables,
food articles inflation moderated only
marginally from 8.0 per cent in November
to 7.1 per cent in December in contrast to
the sharp decline in food articles inflation
(including vegetables) from 8.5 per cent
to 0.7 per cent during the same period.

down industrial production. However,
the PMI-Manufacturing rebounded
to 54.2 in December 2011 from 51.0
in November. The PMI-Services also
recovered markedly to 53.2 in November
and further to 54.2 in December from
the below 50 levels in the preceding
two months. On the agriculture front,
rabi sowing as of January 20, 2012 was
marginally lower (-1.1 per cent) than that
in last year.
16.
According to the Reserve Bank’s
order books, inventories and capacity
utilisation survey, capacity utilisation of
the manufacturing sector in Q2 of 201112 remained broadly the same as in the
preceding quarter. Business confidence,
as measured by the business expectations
indices of the Reserve Bank’s industrial
outlook survey, showed a slight pickup in Q3 of 2011-12, while it pointed
towards moderation in the next quarter.

19.
Fuel group inflation remained
high at 14.9 per cent in December 2011,
reflecting high global crude oil prices
and rupee depreciation. In fact, there is
sizeable suppressed inflation in the fuelgroup as administered prices do not fully
reflect the market prices.

17.
Headline wholesale price index
(WPI) inflation, which averaged 9.7
per cent (y-o-y) during April-October
2011, moderated to 9.1 per cent in
November and further to 7.5 per cent in
December. The decline in inflation was
driven largely by a decline in primary
food and non-food articles inflation.
The momentum indicator of WPI, as
measured by the seasonally adjusted
3-month moving average inflation rate,
also showed a decline.

20.
Notably, non-food manufactured
products inflation remains elevated. It
declined from 8.1 per cent in October
to 7.9 per cent in November and further
to 7.7 per cent in December. However,
going by the revision in the number for
October 2011, the inflation numbers for
November and December too are likely
to be revised upwards. This indicator
is sensitive to international commodity
prices and currency movements and the
recent rupee depreciation has accentuated
price pressures as reflected by this
indicator.

18.
Primary articles inflation, which
was in double digits for over two
4

21.
As measured by the consumer
price index (CPI) for industrial workers,
inflation moderated from double digits in
September to 9.3 per cent in November.
Inflation in terms of consumer price
indices for agricultural and rural
labourers moderated significantly in
December. The new combined (rural
and urban) consumer price index (base:
2010=100) declined marginally from
114.4 in November to 113.9 in December,
reflecting softening of food prices.

engineering, cement and cement
products.

22.
Money supply (M 3 ) growth,
which was 17.2 per cent at the beginning
of the financial year, reflecting the
strong growth in time deposits following
increase in interest rates by banks,
moderated to 15.6 per cent by endDecember 2011 consistent with the
projected trajectory of 15.5 per cent for
the year.

25.
During Q3 of 2011-12, the modal
deposit rate of banks increased by 44
basis points for maturity up to 1 year,
and 9 basis points for maturity between
1 to 3 years. During Q3, 23 banks raised
their base rates by 10-100 basis points
even as the modal base rate of banks
remained unchanged at 10.75 per cent.
The slowdown in total resource flow to
the commercial sector and the peaking of
base rates of banks reflect slowing down
of investment activity.

24.
Resource flows to the commercial
sector from other sources partly offset
the deceleration in bank credit. The
estimated total flow of financial
resources from banks, non-banks and
external sources to the commercial
sector during April-December of 2011 at
around `9.2 trillion was, however, lower
than that of `9.5 trillion during the same
period of last year.

23.
However, non-food credit
growth moderated from 21.3 per cent
at end-March to 15.7 per cent by endDecember 2011, a rate below the
indicative projection of 18 per cent
set out in the SQR. Credit deceleration
was particularly sharp for public sector
banks, with growth moderating from
21 per cent to about 15 per cent during
the same period. Disaggregated data
for November showed that there was a
general deceleration in the credit flow
across sectors, except for personal loans.
The deceleration was particularly sharp
in agriculture, real estate, infrastructure,

26.
Liquidity conditions, which have
generally remained in deficit during
2011-12, tightened further beginning
the second week of November 2011,
partly reflecting the Reserve Bank’s
forex market operations and advance
tax outflows around mid-December.
Average borrowings under the Reserve
Bank’s daily liquidity adjustment facility
(LAF) increased from around `480
billion during April-September 2011 to
around `920 billion during November
5

29.
The Central Government’s key
deficit indicators widened during 201112 (April-November) relative to the
levels in the corresponding period of
last year, and were higher even when
compared with the deficit levels adjusted
for the one-off spectrum receipts last
year. This was reflected in the increase in
borrowings by the Government. Beyond
the budgeted estimate of `4,170 billion,
the Central Government announced an
increase in borrowings through dated
securities of about `530 billion in
September and further `400 billion in
December. Consequently, the revised
gross (net) borrowings for the year now
work out to about `5,100 billion (`4,360
billion). About 83 per cent of revised
gross (`4,220 billion) and 80 per cent of
net market borrowings (`3,480 billion)
were raised up to January 16, 2012. The
Central Government has also announced
an increase in the borrowing through net
issuances of Treasury Bills by `1,025
billion over the budgeted amount of `150
billion for 2011-12.

and further to `1,170 billion in December
2011. Average daily borrowings under
the LAF were about `1,200 billion
during January (up to January 20, 2012).
To ease the tightness in liquidity, and
consistent with its monetary policy
stance of managing liquidity to ensure
that it remained in moderate deficit, the
Reserve Bank conducted open market
operations (OMOs) aggregating over
`700 billion during November 2011-mid
January 2012.
27.
Under the marginal standing
facility (MSF), banks can drawdown
up to one per cent of their net demand
and time liabilities (NDTL) from their
prescribed statutory liquidity ratio
(SLR) portfolio. On December 21, 2011,
the Reserve Bank clarified that banks
could access the MSF even if they had
excess SLR holdings. In view of the
tight liquidity conditions, some banks
accessed funds from the MSF window
during December 2011-January 2012.
28.
With the introduction of the
new operating procedure of monetary
policy in May 2011, overnight money
market rates have become more stable.
The overnight interest rates generally
remained close to the repo rate during
2011-12 (up to January 20, 2012), barring
a few days when the call rate breached
the interest rate ceiling determined by the
MSF rate owing to tightness of liquidity
on account of advance tax outflows.

30.
The 10-year benchmark
government security yield, which
remained range-bound during the first
half of 2011-12, rose during October,
after the commencement of second
half borrowing programme of the
government. The yield, however, eased
subsequently from 8.89 per cent at
end-October to 8.74 per cent at endNovember and further to 8.22 per cent
as on January 20, 2012. The moderation
6

monitor developments in the external
sector and their impact on the exchange
rate and, as indicated in the Mid-Quarter
Review (MQR) of December 2011, will
take action, as appropriate.

in yield reflected improved demand for
government securities as credit demand
slackened, OMO purchases by the
Reserve Bank, increase in debt cap for
foreign institutional investors (FIIs) for
investment in government securities,
and expectation of moderation in
inflation.

32.
During H1 (April-September)
of 2011-12, the current account deficit
(CAD), in absolute terms, widened
relative to H1 of last year, reflecting
widening of the trade deficit due to
significant increase in international
prices of imported commodities,
especially crude oil and gold as well
as moderation of growth in exports of
services. However, as a proportion of
GDP, the CAD at 3.6 per cent was a
shade lower than 3.7 per cent in H1
of last year. During Q3 of 2011-12,
merchandise exports growth decelerated,
on an average, to 7.7 per cent y-o-y
from an average of 36.9 per cent during
the first half of 2011-12. With imports
growth moderating more slowly than
exports growth, the trade deficit for Q3
widened further.

31.
The foreign exchange market
remained under pressure in Q3 of 201112, reflecting adverse global sentiments
and moderation in capital inflows.
Between end-March 2011 and January
13, 2012, the 6, 30 and 36-currency trade
weighted real effective exchange rates
(REER) depreciated by about 9 per cent
each, primarily reflecting the nominal
depreciation of rupee against the US
dollar by about 13.2 per cent. Much of the
depreciation happened during AugustDecember. The Reserve Bank took a
number of steps to stimulate capital
inflows and curb speculation, besides
also intervening in the market consistent
with its policy of containing volatility
and preventing disruptive movements.

II. Outlook and Projections
Global Outlook

economies and past monetary tightening
undertaken by EDEs to contain inflation,
growth in the EDEs has also been
moderating. Accordingly, global growth
during 2012 is expected to be lower
than the International Monetary Fund’s
September 2011 projection of 4.0 per
cent.

Growth
33.
Global growth prospects for 2012
have deteriorated in an environment of
increasing concerns over the sovereign
debt crisis in the euro area amidst limited
monetary and fiscal policy space. Given
the weak growth prospects in advanced

Growth

indicated that some of these risks were
indeed materialising such as increase
in global uncertainty, weak industrial
growth, slowdown in investment activity
and deceleration in the resource flow to
the commercial sector. Consequently,
while agricultural prospects look
buoyant, industrial production has
decelerated. The slowdown in industrial
production will also impact service
sector growth. Further, weaker global
growth will also have an adverse impact.
Accordingly, the baseline projection
of GDP growth for 2011-12 is revised
downwards from 7.6 per cent to 7.0 per
cent (Chart 1).

35.
In the SQR of October 2011, the
Reserve Bank projected GDP growth of
7.6 per cent for 2011-12, though with
significant downside risks. In the MQR
of December 2011, the Reserve Bank

Looking ahead to 2012-13, while
a formal projection will be made in the
Annual Policy Statement in April, the
Reserve Bank’s baseline scenario is
that the economy will exhibit a modest

34.
Although non-oil commodity
prices showed some correction in 2011,
crude oil prices have remained firm.
Supply limitations and continued ultra
accommodative monetary policies
in major advanced economies pose
upside risks to commodity prices in
2012. Currency depreciation in EDEs
witnessed in the second half of 2011
and the lagged pass-through to domestic
prices could also add to inflationary
pressures in EDEs.
Domestic Outlook

moderation in non-food manufactured
products inflation. Fuel inflation remains
well above double digits. Keeping in
view the expected moderation in nonfood manufactured products inflation,
domestic supply factors and global
trends in commodity prices, the baseline
projection for WPI inflation is retained
at 7 per cent as set out in the SQR
(Chart 2).

recovery, with growth being slightly
faster than that during the current year.
37.
It must be emphasised that
investment activity has slowed down
significantly. As indicated above, while
global factors are contributing, domestic
conditions are also responsible and a
change in the investment climate is
contingent on these adverse conditions
being addressed by policy actions.
Without this, a continuing decline in
investment will push the economy’s trend
rate of growth down, further aggravating
inflationary pressures and threatening
external and internal stability.

39.
A significant downgrade in the
growth projection would normally have
been accompanied by a downward
revision in the inflation projection.
However, in the current circumstances,
two factors have prevented this from
happening. First, rupee depreciation has
been feeding into core inflation, delaying
the adjustment of inflation to slower
growth. Second, very importantly,
suppressed inflation in petroleum product

Food inflation has moderated
more than anticipated because of a
sharp drop in vegetable prices. This
benefit has, however, been offset to a
large extent by the lower than expected

9

non-food credit growth at 15.7 per cent
was below the indicative projection of 18
per cent, reflecting the combined effect
of a slowing economy and increasing
risk aversion by banks. The deceleration
in non-food bank credit is explained, to
a large extent, by the expansion in net
bank credit to the government which
increased at a significantly higher rate
of 24.4 per cent as compared with 17.3
per cent last year. Keeping in view the
increased government borrowings and
slowdown in private credit demand,
M3 growth projection for 2011-12 has
been retained at 15.5 per cent, while
non-food credit growth has been scaled
down to 16.0 per cent. These numbers,
as always, are indicative projections and
not targets.

and coal prices remains quite significant.
While a rationalisation of prices is
welcome for a variety of well known
reasons, it will impact observed inflation
in the short-term. This projection is based
on the likelihood of some adjustments
being made in these prices.
40.
Looking ahead to 2012-13, while
a formal projection will be made in
the Annual Policy Statement in April,
the Reserve Bank’s baseline scenario
is that headline inflation may show
some moderation, though remaining
vulnerable to a variety of upside risks,
indicated later in this Review.
41.
Although inflation has remained
persistently high over the past two
years, it is important to note that during
the 2000s, it averaged around 5.5 per
cent, both in terms of WPI and CPI,
down from its earlier trend rate of
about 7.5 per cent. Given this record,
the conduct of monetary policy will
continue to condition and contain
perception of inflation in the range of
4.0-4.5 per cent. This is in line with the
medium-term objective of 3.0 per cent
inflation consistent with India’s broader
integration into the global economy.

Risk Factors
43.
The indicative projections of
growth and inflation for 2011-12 are
subject to a number of risks as indicated
below:
i)

Monetary Aggregates
42.
Money supply (M3) growth at
15.6 per cent (y-o-y) in December 2011
was in line with the indicative trajectory
of 15.5 per cent for 2011-12. However,
10

Sovereign debt concerns in the
euro area pose a major downside
risk to overall growth outlook. The
absence of a credible solution to
the euro area problem is weighing
on global growth prospects even
as recent data suggest that there
is some improvement in the US
recovery. Continuing uncertainty
in the euro area will adversely
affect Indian growth through trade,
finance and confidence channels.

ii)

below the indicative trajectory of
18 per cent. Apart from slowdown
of economic activity, it also reflects
increasing risk aversion by banks
due to increase in non-performing
assets. Although banks need to be
prudent while sanctioning credit
proposals, risk aversion by the
banking sector could adversely
affect credit flow to productive
sectors of the economy.

Capital inflows to India have slowed
down on account of portfolio rebalancing by FIIs due to global
uncertainty. This raises concerns,
especially because the current
account deficit of India has widened.
The exchange rate has already come
under significant pressure, which
has also added to inflationary
pressures. If the global situation
does not improve, capital inflows
could continue to be adversely
affected. In this scenario, the size of
the current account deficit poses a
significant threat to macroeconomic
stability.

v)

iii) Even as global food and metal
prices have moderated further,
global energy prices have increased.
Should crude prices spike due to
supply constraints on account of
geo-political factors or decline
significantly due to a deterioration in
the global macroeconomic situation,
they will have implications for
domestic growth and inflation.
Exchange rate movements will also
be an important factor in shaping
the impact of global crude prices
on domestic prices.
iv) Non-food credit growth has slowed
down. Although some slowdown
in credit growth was expected on
account of monetary tightening,
credit growth has decelerated more
than expected and is currently

Although food inflation has declined
in the recent period, this was
mainly due to a seasonal decline
in vegetable prices. Going by past
trends, the extent of decline in
vegetable prices seen in December
this year is usually observed in
the winter season (DecemberFebruary). As such, the decline in
food inflation is likely to be limited
in coming months. Beyond this,
inflation in respect of protein-based
items remains high. In the absence
of appropriate supply responses of
those commodities where there are
structural imbalances, particularly
protein-based items, risks to food
inflation will continue to be on the
upside. Significantly, there has been
reduction in rabi acreage for pulses,
which may have an adverse impact
on prices.

vi) There is still a large element of
suppressed inflation as domestic
prices of some administered products
11

do not reflect the underlying market
conditions. This is particularly
true of coal which had seen an
increase towards the end of last
year but no increase this year
so far. Since coal is an input for
electricity, coal prices, as and when
raised, will also have implications
for electricity tariffs. Further,
the current levels of domestic
prices of petroleum products do
not reflect international prices.
Petroleum product prices have
also not been revised in response
to crude oil prices, contributing to
both fiscal slippages and suppressed
inflation. Revision in domestic
administered prices will add to
inflationary pressures, although
such revisions are necessary to
maintain the balance between

supply and demand. Particularly,
as the food subsidy bill is expected
to rise, it will be prudent to fully
deregulate diesel prices to contain
both aggregate demand and trade
deficit.
vii) The fiscal deficit of the government
has remained elevated since 200809. If the increase in government
borrowing already announced is an
indication, the gross fiscal deficit
for 2011-12 will overshoot the
budget estimate substantially. At
the current juncture when there is
a need to boost private investment,
the increase in fiscal deficit could
potentially crowd out credit to the
private sector. Moreover, slippage
in the fiscal deficit has been adding
to inflationary pressures and it
continues to be a risk for inflation.

III. The Policy Stance
2011 was on containing inflation and
anchoring inflation expectations even
as it meant sacrificing some growth.
However, in view of slowdown in
growth, especially investment activity
and expected moderation in inflation
beginning December, it was decided to
pause in the MQR of December 2011.

44.
The Reserve Bank began exiting
from the crisis driven expansionary
policy in October 2009. Between January
2010 and October 2011, the Reserve
Bank cumulatively raised the cash
reserve ratio (CRR) by 100 basis points
and the policy rate (the repo rate) 13
times by 375 basis points. This monetary
policy response was calibrated on the
basis of India specific growth-inflation
dynamics. The focus of the monetary
policy stance during May-October

as expected. Even as inflation remains
elevated, despite moderation, downside
risks to growth have increased. The
growth-inflation balance of the monetary
policy stance has now shifted to growth,
while at the same time ensuring that
inflationary pressures remain contained.
Accordingly, the policy stance in this
review is shaped by the following three
major considerations.

48.
Third, liquidity conditions have
remained tight beyond the comfort
zone of the Reserve Bank. Although the
Reserve Bank has conducted open market
purchase of government securities to
inject liquidity of over `700 billion,
the structural deficit in the system has
increased significantly, which could hurt
the credit flow to productive sectors of
the economy. The large structural deficit
in the system presents a strong case for
injecting permanent primary liquidity
into the system.

46.
First, growth is decelerating.
This reflects the combined impact of
several factors: the uncertain global
environment, the cumulative impact
of past monetary policy tightening
and domestic policy uncertainties.
Credit offtake has also been below the
projected trajectory. While slowdown in
the growth of demand was the expected
outcome of monetary policy actions that
were taken to contain inflation, at this
juncture, risks to growth have increased.
This is also reflected in the scaling down
of the growth projection for 2011-12 by
the Reserve Bank.

Against this backdrop, the stance
of monetary policy is intended to:

On the basis of current assessment
and in line with the policy stance
outlined in Section III, the Reserve
Bank announces the following policy
measures:

Bank Rate

The Bank Rate has been retained
at 6.0 per cent.

Cash Reserve Ratio

It has been decided to:

cent of their net demand and time
liabilities (NDTL) effective the

57.
In reducing the CRR, the Reserve
Bank has attempted to address the
structural pressures on liquidity in a
way that is not inconsistent with the
prevailing monetary stance. In the two
previous guidances, it was indicated that
the cycle of rate increases had peaked
and further actions were likely to reverse
the cycle. Based on the current inflation
trajectory, including consideration of
suppressed inflation, it is premature
to begin reducing the policy rate. The
reduction in the policy rate will be
conditioned by signs of sustainable
moderation in inflation. However, the
persistence of tight liquidity conditions
could disrupt credit flow and further
exacerbate growth risks. In this context,
the CRR is the most effective instrument
for permanent liquidity injections over a
sustained period of time. The reduction
can also be viewed as a reinforcement
of the guidance that future rate actions
will be towards lowering them.

rate actions is contingent on a number
of factors. Policy and administrative
actions, which induce investment that
will help alleviate supply constraints
in food and infrastructure, are critical.
Initiatives to narrow skill mismatches
in labour markets will help ease the
pressure on wages. The anticipated
fiscal slippage, which is caused largely
by high levels of consumption spending
by the government, poses a significant
threat to both inflation management
and, more broadly, to macroeconomic
stability.

Expected Outcomes
60.
The policy actions and the
guidance in this Statement given are
expected to:
i)

Ease liquidity conditions.

ii)

Mitigate downside risks to growth.

iii) Continue to anchor medium-term

inflation expectations on the basis
of a credible commitment to low
and stable inflation.

59.
Strong signs of fiscal
consolidation, which will shift the
balance of aggregate demand from
public to private and from consumption
to capital formation, are critical to create
the space for lowering the policy rate
without the imminent risk of resurgent
inflation. In the absence of credible
fiscal consolidation, the Reserve Bank
will be constrained from lowering the
policy rate in response to decelerating
private consumption and investment
spending. The forthcoming Union
