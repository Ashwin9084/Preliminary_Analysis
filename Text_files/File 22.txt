Statement by Dr.Y.Venugopal Reddy,
Governor, Reserve Bank of India on the
First Quarter Review of Annual Monetary Policy
for the Year 2007-08
This Review consists of three sections: I. Assessment of
Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments; II. Stance of
Monetary Policy; and III. Monetary Measures. An analytical review
of macroeconomic and monetary developments was issued a
day in advance as a supplement to this Review, providing the
necessary information and technical analysis with the help of
charts and tables.

I. Assessment of Macroeconomic and
Monetary Developments
Domestic Developments
2.
At the end of May 2007, the Central Statistical
Organisation (CSO) released quarterly real GDP growth estimates
for January-March 2007 at 9.1 per cent as against 10.0 per cent
a year ago. Along with revisions for the preceding three quarters,
real GDP growth in 2006-07 was raised to 9.4 per cent from
9.2 per cent in the CSO’s February 2007 advance estimates. In
the revised estimates, real GDP originating in agriculture, industry
and services sectors increased by 2.7 per cent, 11.0 per cent
and 11.0 per cent, respectively, in 2006-07 as against
6.0 per cent, 8.0 per cent and 10.3 per cent in 2005-06.
Over the four-year period starting in 2003-04 when the
current expansionary phase began, real GDP growth has
averaged 8.6 per cent, up from 5.1 per cent in the preceding
four years and also above the average of 5.7 per cent achieved
in the 1990s.

3.
The progress of the 2007 south-west monsoon season
has been satisfactory so far, despite initial delays in its onset
over the western, north-western and central regions. Of the
normal area of 71.9 million hectares under kharif foodgrain
crops, 30.1 million hectares were covered by sowing by July 20
this year, which is comparable with 30.0 million hectares in the
corresponding period of the preceding year. Also, 12.2 million
hectares were covered under major oilseeds as against 11.7
million hectares last year. While area sown under cotton
(7.2 million hectares) was higher, that under sugarcane
(4.4 million hectares) and jute (0.8 million hectares) was
somewhat lower as compared with the previous year. During
June 1 to July 25, 2007 rainfall has been 4 per cent above the
long-period average (LPA) and excess/normal in 29 of the
36 meteorological subdivisions, according to the India
Meteorological Department (IMD). The IMD has updated its initial
forecast released on April 19, 2007 and has placed the rainfall
for the south-west monsoon season at 93 per cent of the LPA
for the country as a whole in its latest forecast released on
June 29, 2007.
4.
The general index of industrial production (IIP) rose by
11.7 per cent in April-May 2007 from 10.8 per cent a year ago.
The acceleration in industrial activity in the current financial year
was led by manufacturing output which rose by 12.7 per cent as
against 12.2 per cent in April-May 2006. Electricity generation
and mining activity increased by 9.0 per cent and 3.0 per cent,
respectively, as against 5.5 per cent and 3.2 per cent a year
ago. Within manufacturing, industries such as machinery
and equipment, food products, basic metals and alloys and
chemicals emerged as growth drivers in 2007-08 (up to May).
In terms of the use-based classification, production of capital
2

goods increased by 18.6 per cent (20.6 per cent a year ago),
while the production of basic goods and intermediate
goods rose by 9.4 per cent (9.2 per cent) and 10.5 per cent
(10.5 per cent), respectively. Consumer goods output increased
by 12.7 per cent (9.7 per cent). The six infrastructure industries,
comprising nearly 27 per cent of the IIP, posted a growth of
8.1 per cent during April-May 2007 as against 7.2 per cent a
year ago. Output growth picked up in respect of petroleum
products and electricity, whereas some deceleration was recorded
in steel, coal and cement output and crude petroleum production
declined marginally.
5.
Private corporate activity has gained strength and
resilience, extending an unprecedented run of high growth that
began in late 2002-03. Full information on corporate sector
performance in 2006-07 that is now available for select private
non-financial companies indicates that sales growth was of the
order of 26.2 per cent, the highest since the 1980s. The pick-up
in activity in 2006-07 was aided by improvements in operational
efficiency, increased plant automation, cost control through better
product mix, capacity utilisation and economies of scale, rising
incomes from financial activity and return of pricing power.
The growth in net profits of these companies was also high at
45.2 per cent as compared with 24.2 per cent a year ago.
Over the period 2003-07, annual sales growth of select private
non-financial companies averaged 20.8 per cent, while annual
growth in net profits of these companies was 45.1 per cent.
Early results for the first quarter of 2007-08 present a complex
picture. Demand and investment conditions continue to be
favourable. There is some deceleration in sales and profit growth,
relative to the levels recorded in the preceding year. This may
be reflecting some increase in input and staff costs.
3

6.
In the Reserve Bank’s Industrial Outlook Survey conducted
during May 2007, nearly 60 per cent of respondent companies
reported no change in capacity utilisation and a majority also
indicated no change in the financial situation, working capital
finance requirements and availability of finance. Responses
relating to export orders, imports and profits were somewhat
mixed. The business expectations index for April-June 2007
declined by 7.1 percentage points from its level in the preceding
quarter and by 6.0 percentage points from its level a year ago.
The outlook for July-September 2007 appears to be optimistic
with 54 per cent of the respondents expecting an improvement
in the overall business situation on the back of increase
in production, order books and capacity utilisation. As in
April-June 2007 a majority of respondents expect no change in
the financial situation, working capital finance requirements,
availability of finance and in profit margins. The overall business
expectations index for July-September 2007 declined by
3.8 percentage points from its level in the previous quarter and
by 5.4 percentage points from a year ago.
7.
Business sentiment polled by other surveys presents a
varied response, with optimism relating to sales volume, order
books and net profits being tempered by the impact of exchange
rate changes on services sector companies as well as export
industries with relatively low import content. According to one
survey, business confidence for July 2007 continues to be high
but has declined by 8.8 per cent from its level in April-June 2007
and by 2.7 per cent year-on-year. Seasonally adjusted purchasing
managers’ indices for the first quarter of 2007-08 indicate
favourable operating conditions in the manufacturing sector with
the growth of output and new orders being maintained, a modest
rise in staff hiring and selling prices, some easing of input price
4

inflation and a build-up in pre-production and finished goods
inventory levels. These indices also reflect some optimism about
the general business scenario among micro, small and medium
enterprises with more than 90 per cent planning higher capital
investment.
8.
Services sector activity has expanded in the first quarter
of 2007-08 as reflected in lead indicators. The communication
sector has recorded robust growth with 8,18,000 new lines being
added to the switching capacity of telephone exchanges and
total telephone connections (fixed plus cellular) registering an
increase of 77.6 per cent in April-May 2007 on a year-on-year
basis. In the transport sector, cargo handled at major ports
increased by 17.8 per cent, whereas railway revenue earnings
from freight traffic increased by 6.0 per cent. In civil aviation,
handling of import cargo and export cargo increased by 21.7
per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively. Passengers handled at
domestic and international terminals increased by 24.4 per cent
and 13.1 per cent, respectively, as against 47.2 per cent and
14.1 per cent a year ago.
9.
The CSO’s end-May 2007 release provides estimates of
expenditure components of GDP in 2006-07, which contain
information on the evolution of the constituents of aggregate
demand. As a proportion to GDP, real private final consumption
expenditure declined to 57.2 per cent during 2006-07 from
58.9 per cent in the previous year. On the other hand, real gross
fixed capital formation (GFCF) increased to 27.9 per cent of
GDP from 26.7 per cent, indicating that the acceleration of growth
in the Indian economy is mainly investment-driven, despite
domestic private consumption remaining the major component
of aggregate demand. As regards external demand, net exports
5

at (-) 2.8 per cent of GDP in 2006-07 were comparable to
(-) 3.0 per cent in the previous year. Over the four-year period
from 2003-04 to 2006-07, private consumption and gross
capital formation increased in real terms by 6.3 per cent and
16.3 per cent per annum, respectively.
10.
Turning to monetary and financial conditions, the
year-on-year non-food credit growth of scheduled commercial
banks (SCBs) at 24.4 per cent (Rs.3,67,258 crore) on July 6,
2007 was lower than 32.8 per cent (Rs.3,70,899 crore) a year
ago. On a financial year basis, non-food credit declined
by Rs.12,094 crore (0.6 per cent) during 2007-08 (up to
July 6, 2007), in contrast to an increase of Rs.36,654 crore
(2.5 per cent) in the corresponding period of the previous year.
Food credit registered a decline of Rs.2,292 crore as against a
decline of Rs.2,837 crore in the corresponding period last year.
11.
Provisional information on the sectoral pattern of bank
credit available up to March 2007 indicates some rebalancing of
credit deployment, particularly in January-March 2007. During
2006-07, bank credit to agriculture recorded the highest growth
(32.4 per cent), followed by the services sector (31.0 per cent),
personal loans (26.5 per cent) and industry (25.7 per cent).
Growth in housing and real estate loans decelerated modestly
to 24.6 per cent and 69.8 per cent, respectively, although
continuing to remain at elevated levels. Incremental credit
off-take, however, was the highest in respect of industry
(36.1 per cent), followed by services (25.2 per cent), personal
loans (24.3 per cent) and agriculture (14.4 per cent). Within the
industrial sector, sizeable credit off-take was recorded in respect
of infrastructure (26.8 per cent), textiles (34.2 per cent),
basic metals and metal products (26.7 per cent), petroleum
6

(41.0 per cent), food processing (27.9 per cent), engineering
(24.5 per cent), chemicals (14.2 per cent) and construction
(46.7 per cent). The share of textiles, infrastructure and basic
metal and metal products in total credit to industry increased
marginally from 10.6 per cent, 20.5 per cent and 12.0 per cent,
respectively, to 11.3 per cent, 20.7 per cent and 12.1 per cent,
while the share of engineering remained stable at 6.3 per cent.
The share of industrial credit to chemicals declined from
8.8 per cent to 8.0 per cent. Priority sector advances grew by
24.0 per cent with a reduction in their share in outstanding
non-food gross bank credit to 35.2 per cent in March 2007 from
36.4 per cent a year ago. Provisional information for May 2007
indicates continuing high credit growth to agriculture and the
industrial sector and deceleration in credit to housing, real estate
and personal loans.
12.
On a year-on-year basis, commercial banks’ investments
in shares, bonds/debentures and commercial paper (CP) declined
by Rs.809 crore (1.0 per cent) as compared with a decline
of Rs.9,961 crore (11.1 per cent) a year ago. On a financial
year basis, such investments by banks fell by Rs.4,145 crore
(5.2 per cent) during 2007-08 so far (up to July 6), as against
an increase of Rs.593 crore (0.7 per cent) in the corresponding
period of 2006-07. Banks, however, invested Rs.45,048 crore
in instruments issued by mutual funds as against only
Rs.15,902 crore in the corresponding period of 2006-07. The
year-on-year growth in total flow of resources from SCBs to the
commercial sector was 23.1 per cent (Rs.3,66,450 crore), lower
than 29.5 per cent (Rs.3,60,938 crore) a year ago.
13.
The year-on-year increase in aggregate deposits of SCBs
at 24.4 per cent (Rs.5,31,881 crore) up to July 6, 2007 was
7

higher than 20.9 per cent (Rs.3,77, 392 crore) a year ago. The
outflow of long-term deposits during the preceding two years
has been arrested and there were fresh accretions to long-term
deposits in April-June 2007 which augurs well for banks’
asset-liability management. On a financial year basis, aggregate
deposits increased by Rs.1,05,534 crore (4.0 per cent) during
2007-08 up to July 6, 2007 as against an increase of
Rs.72,913 crore (3.5 per cent) in the corresponding period
of the previous year. The accretion to bank deposits during the
current financial year so far (April-July 6, 2007) is at a 14-year
high. The incremental annual non-food credit-deposit ratio as
on July 6, 2007 declined to 69.0 per cent from 98.3 per cent a
year ago.
14.
By the beginning of the current financial year, several
banks had drawn down holdings of statutory liquidity ratio
(SLR)-eligible securities close to the statutory floor to
accommodate the sustained non-food credit demand over the
last three years. Reflecting the ongoing shifts in banks’ portfolios
to comply with the statutory requirements in view of this depletion,
investment in Government and other approved securities by SCBs
increased by Rs.59,515 crore during the current year so far
(up to July 6, 2007) as against an increase of Rs.51,776 crore in
the corresponding period of 2006-07. Exclusive of liquidity
adjustment facility (LAF) operations, however, banks’ investments
in Government and other approved securities increased by
Rs.27,331 crore as compared with an increase of Rs.751 crore
a year ago. On July 6, 2007 commercial banks’ holdings of
Government and other approved securities was 28.7 per cent of
the banking system’s net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as
against 28.0 per cent at end-March 2007 and 31.5 per cent a
year ago. Such investments were Rs.1,10,207 crore above the
8

statutory minimum of 25 per cent of NDTL. It may be recalled
that the Union Budget, 2006-07 announced the unwinding of the
entire outstanding amount of recapitalisation bonds/special
securities of Rs.20,809 crore issued to nationalised banks.
Accordingly, bonds/securities issued to 19 nationalised banks
worth Rs.8,709 crore were converted into marketable securities
on February 15, 2007 and made eligible for SLR purposes. This
conversion augmented the stock of SLR-eligible securities in the
system which would increase even further with the conversion
of the remaining recapitalisation bonds/special securities during
the course of 2007-08.
15.
Money supply (M3) increased by 21.6 per cent on a
year-on-year basis on July 6, 2007 which was above the projected
trajectory of 17.0-17.5 per cent indicated in the Annual Policy
Statement for 2007-08 and higher than 19.0 per cent a year
ago. On a financial year basis, M3 increased by 3.8 per cent
(Rs.1,24,365 crore) during 2007-08 up to July 6, 2007 as
compared with the increase of 3.5 per cent (Rs.95,488 crore) in
the corresponding period of the previous year.
16.
Reserve money increased by 29.1 per cent on a
year-on-year basis on July 20, 2007 which was higher than
17.2 per cent a year ago. During the current financial year up to
July 20, 2007 reserve money increased by 6.2 per cent
(Rs.43,659 crore) as compared with the increase of 1.8 per cent
(Rs.10,069 crore) in the corresponding period of the previous
year. Among the components, currency in circulation increased
by 2.1 per cent (Rs.10,380 crore) as compared with 4.6 per cent
(Rs.19,630 crore). Among the sources of reserve money, the
Reserve Bank’s net foreign currency assets increased by
Rs.29,653 crore as against an increase of Rs.85,084 crore in
9

the corresponding period last year. Adjusted for revaluation
effects, the Reserve Bank’s net foreign currency assets increased
by Rs.72,947 crore as against an increase of Rs.30,663 crore in
the corresponding period of 2006-07. Net Reserve Bank credit
to the Central Government increased by Rs.18,875 crore as
against a decline of Rs.6,356 crore.
17.
Over the first quarter of 2007-08, generally easy conditions
of liquidity were interspersed with sporadic and transient periods
of tightness. Build-up of the Central Government’s cash balances
by the third week of March 2007 and balance sheet adjustments
by banks at the end of March necessitated daily injections of
liquidity through the LAF between March 16 and April 8.
With the two-stage 50 basis point increase in the CRR announced
on March 30 becoming effective on April 14 and April 28,
repo operations were conducted again through April 16 - May 6.
Throughout this period, contrastingly, market participants took
recourse to reverse repos on a daily basis within the ceiling of
Rs.3,000 crore set since March 5, 2007. During the quarter, an
amount of Rs.18,377 crore was sterilised through the Market
Stabilisation Scheme (MSS), warranted by strong capital inflows.
By April 27, 2007 the Central Government slipped into drawal
of ways and means advances (WMA) which deteriorated
into overdraft during May 30-June 8. Call rates remained
high during most part of April and May and ruled above the
LAF repo rate.
18.
From May 28, 2007 the system shifted into a phase of
large surplus liquidity with continuous reverse repos on a daily
basis, capped at Rs.3,000 crore, except on June 28-29, 2007
when the Reserve Bank injected money through repos to assuage
liquidity tightness due to advance tax outflows. While the Central
10

Government vacated overdrafts from June 9, it continued to
avail of WMA until June 17, 2007. There was a brief return to
surplus cash balances during June 18-28 but recourse to WMA
resumed thereafter, turning into overdrafts during July 3-8 and
July 18, 2007 onwards. Additional market borrowings beyond
the calendar were resorted to in order to finance, in part, the
purchase of the Reserve Bank’s stake in the State Bank of
India. The amount of Rs.35,351 crore has been received by the
Reserve Bank on June 29, 2007. The customary surplus
transferable to the Central Government from the Reserve Bank
for the year ending June 2007 is likely to be credited to the
account of the Central Government in mid-August 2007.
19.
The suffusion of liquidity flows in the financial markets
mainly on account of the sharp depletion of the Central
Government’s cash balances was reflected in call rates plunging
to close to one per cent levels, going even below on several
occasions. The total overhang of liquidity under the LAF, the
MSS and cash balances of the Central Government taken
together declined from an average of Rs.97,449 crore in March
2007 to Rs.72,823 crore on July 27, 2007. An assessment of
the total liquidity overhang, however, should also account for
the transfer of Rs.35,351 crore from the Central Government to
the Reserve Bank during this period. It also needs to be noted
that in view of the ceiling on daily LAF reverse repos, the
overhang as defined here provides the magnitude of liquidity
impounded only through these instruments and it captures the
overhang only when the Reserve Bank injects liquidity under the
LAF. On a net basis, average daily LAF repos declined from
Rs.11,858 crore in March 2007 to average daily reverse repo of
Rs.2,117 crore in July 2007 (up to July 27, 2007). The outstanding
balances under MSS increased from Rs.64,863 crore at
11

end-March 2007 to Rs.90,030 crore on July 27. Cash balances
of the Centre with the Reserve Bank declined from an average
of Rs.55,893 crore in March 2007 to a debit of Rs.20,199 crore
on July 27, 2007.
20.
Inflation, measured by variations in the wholesale price
index (WPI) on a year-on-year basis, declined from 5.9 per cent
at end-March 2007 to 4.4 per cent as on July 14, 2007. Prices
of primary articles and manufactured products rose by
10.0 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively, as against the
increase of 3.8 per cent and 3.9 per cent a year ago. Prices of
the fuel group declined by 1.4 per cent as against an increase of
7.2 per cent a year ago. On an annual average basis,
WPI inflation was 5.5 per cent up to July 14, 2007 as against
4.3 per cent a year ago.
21.
Inflationary pressures emerging from supply constraints
in the agricultural sector eased somewhat in the first quarter of
2007-08. The total stock of foodgrains with public agencies
increased to 25.1 million tonnes on May 1, 2007 as against the
buffer stock norm of 16.2 million tonnes and was also higher
than 22.8 million tonnes a year ago. Year-on-year inflation in
terms of foodgrains prices decelerated from 13.5 per cent in
mid-December 2006 to 7.4 per cent by mid-July 2007. There
has, however, been hardening in the prices of oilseeds since
November 2006 with second-round effects on prices of edible
oils and oil cakes. These three items, which together have a
weight of 6.8 per cent in the WPI, contributed 28.7 per cent of
headline inflation as on July 14, 2007. The easing of inflation in
terms of prices of manufactures since end-March 2007 from
6.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent by the second week of July has
been mainly on account of decline in the prices of sugar and
12

some deceleration in prices of basic metals and alloys
and textiles.
22.
The recent surge in global prices of several agricultural
commodities is attributed partly to transitory factors such as
drought-related supply shortfalls and low stocks. Weather-related
setbacks to production occurred in a number of countries such
as the US, the EU, Canada, Russia, Ukraine and most notably
in Australia, where production fell by more than 50 per cent in
2006-07. According to the projections made by the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)–Food
and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), global prices of agricultural
commodities are likely to rule higher than their historic equilibrium
levels over the next ten years on account of various factors
including the rapidly expanding bio-fuel industry which is pushing
up the prices of agricultural commodities through spill-over effects.
Growing cereal use for ethanol has caused reduction in acreage
of oilseeds, particularly in the US, in favour of maize with adverse
price effects. Indirectly, the prices of livestock products have
also gone up due to rising feed costs. These developments
have major implications for India to the extent of dependence
on imports of edible oils and wheat for meeting domestic
shortfalls.
23.
The global dairy market has been facing an increasing
demand for premium products which is likely to continue over
the near-term. In Asia, particularly in China, and in Latin America,
demand for milk products has gone up rapidly. US milk prices
increased by 20 per cent during March-June 2007 fuelled by
export demand and drought-related supply disruptions in Australia
and New Zealand. Milk futures in the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange have risen by 60 per cent. The US Department of
13

Agriculture expects milk prices to remain firm over the rest
of 2007 and in 2008 as well. In India, milk prices reflected in
the WPI increased by 7.7 per cent as on July 14, 2007, on a
year-on-year basis, contributing 7.2 per cent to the headline
WPI inflation.
24.
Notwithstanding the higher production of foodgrains
expected during 2006-07, there is a need for regular
stock-taking, assessment and planning for ensuring the adequate
availability of essential food articles in view of the global outlook.
A comprehensive approach in this regard may take cognisance
of changes in population, consumption patterns and the evolving
trends in international trade.
25.
During 2007-08 so far, West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) prices have moved in a range of US $ 61-77 per barrel
with UK Brent prices above the WTI by US $ 4.1 per barrel,
while the premium of the WTI over the Dubai variety was
US $ 1.40 per barrel. In tandem with the hardening of international
crude prices, the average price of the Indian crude basket
increased from US $ 56.2 per barrel in January-March 2007
to US $ 66.2 per barrel in April-June and to around US $ 73.5
per barrel on July 27, 2007, i.e., an increase of 32.9 per cent
over the level in February 2007. Domestic prices of petrol and
diesel have, however, remained unchanged since mid-February;
prices of aviation turbine fuel, which are market-determined,
have increased by 11.3 per cent in the same period. Excluding
the fuel group, year-on-year inflation was 6.1 per cent on July
14, 2007 and was higher than headline inflation. According to
the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), global demand
is expected to increase by 1.3 million barrels a day during 2007,
while the supply is likely to increase only by 0.6 million barrels a
14

day. WTI prices are expected to average US $ 65.7 per barrel
in 2007.
26.
On a year-on-year basis, inflation based on the consumer
price index (CPI) for agricultural labourers and rural labourers
increased to 7.8 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively, in
June 2007 from 7.2 per cent each a year ago. Year-on-year inflation
based on CPI for industrial workers and urban non-manual
employees was placed at 6.6 per cent and 6.1 per cent,
respectively, in May and June 2007 as against 6.3 per cent and
6.5 per cent, a year ago. The softening of food prices is being
reflected in a reduced difference between inflation rates based
on the CPI and the WPI.
27.
In terms of proportions to budget estimates (BE), revenue
receipts of the Central Government increased to 5.3 per cent
during April-May 2007 from 4.8 per cent in April-May 2006. Total
expenditure at 13.3 per cent was lower than 16.3 per cent a
year ago. Both Plan and non-Plan expenditures were lower as
proportions to BE than a year ago. Accordingly, the gross fiscal
deficit (GFD) declined to 41.2 per cent from 48.5 per cent a year
ago. The revenue deficit at 83.0 per cent of the BE in April-May
2007 was marginally higher than 81.0 per cent in the
corresponding period last year.
28.
Gross market borrowings (dated securities and 364-day
Treasury Bills) of the Central Government during 2007-08 at
Rs.85,628 crore up to July 27, 2007 (Rs.70,813 crore a year
ago) constituted 45.4 per cent of the BE while net market
borrowings at Rs.46,047 crore (Rs.34,822 crore) constituted
42.0 per cent of the BE. Additional borrowings of Rs.6,000 crore
through 182-day Treasury Bills and Rs.18,500 crore through
91-day Treasury Bills were undertaken in June 2007 in order to,
15

inter alia, support the special operation of funding the transfer of
the Reserve Bank’s stake in the State Bank of India to the
Government of India. Against the allocated net borrowing
programme of Rs.23,359 crore for 2007-08, State Governments
have raised a net amount of (-) Rs.645 crore (gross Rs. 8,541
crore; repayment: Rs.9,186 crore) during the current year
(up to July 27, 2007).
29.
During the first quarter of 2007-08, financial markets
experienced sizeable fluctuations in liquidity and attendant
episodes of volatility. Call money rates stayed firm during most
part of April and May 2007, due to the usual tightening of liquidity
at the end of March 2007 which were accentuated by
CRR increases referred to earlier. Call rates stayed above the
LAF corridor for prolonged periods with intermittent fluctuations.
In June, market conditions shifted into surplus liquidity,
engendered by large drawdown of the Central Government’s
cash balances during end-May and early June and capital inflows.
Call rates hovered around one per cent for most part of June
and July (up to July 27) except on June 28-29, 2007 when
advance tax outflows briefly pushed up call rates above the
LAF repo rate. Overnight rates in the call, market repo and
collateralised borrowing and lending obligations (CBLO) segments
have displayed close co-movement. The interest rate in the call
market declined from an average of 14.07 per cent in March
2007 to 8.33 per cent, 6.96 per cent and 2.42 per cent in April,
May and June 2007 and further to 0.90 per cent in July 2007.
Interest rates in the market repo (outside the LAF) and CBLO
segments declined from 8.13 per cent and 7.73 per cent,
respectively, in March 2007 to 6.76 per cent and 6.12 per cent
in April 2007 and further to 0.26 per cent and 0.07 per cent in
July 2007. The daily average volume (one leg) in the call money
16

market declined from Rs.11,608 crore in March 2007 to
Rs.8,687 crore in July 2007. The corresponding volumes in the
market repo were Rs.8,646 crore and Rs.12,070 crore,
respectively, whereas in the CBLO segment, the volumes
were Rs.17,662 crore and Rs.18,509 crore, respectively. As on
July 27, 2007 the weighted average interest rate for CBLO,
market repo and call rate stood at 0.02 per cent, 0.18 per cent
and 0.22 per cent, respectively.
30.
In the primary market, the yield on 91-day Treasury Bills
declined from 7.97 per cent at end-March 2007 to 4.46 per cent
by July 25, 2007. The yield on 364-day Treasury Bills also
recorded a decline from 7.98 per cent to 6.58 per cent by
July 18, 2007. There was a marked increase in commercial
paper (CP) issuances and the outstanding amount increased to
Rs.26,256 crore by end-June 2007 from Rs.17,688 crore at
end-March 2007. The weighted average discount rate on CP
declined from 11.33 per cent to 8.93 per cent over this period.
In the market for certificates of deposit (CDs), the weighted
average discount rate declined from 10.75 per cent at the end of
March 2007 to 9.37 per cent by end-June and the outstanding
amount increased from Rs.93,272 crore to Rs.98,337 crore over
this period.
31.
In the secondary market, the yield on government
securities with one-year residual maturity moved down from
7.55 per cent at end-March 2007 to 6.84 per cent by July 27,
2007. The yields on Government securities with 10-year and
20-year residual maturity also eased during this period from
7.97 per cent to 7.89 per cent and from 8.23 per cent to
8.21 per cent, respectively. Consequently, the yield spread
between 10-year and one-year Government securities widened
17

from 42 basis points to 105 basis points whereas the spread
between 20-year and one-year Government securities widened
from 68 basis points to 137 basis points over this period.
32.
Banks had generally increased their deposit rates by
about 25-50 basis points across various maturities between
March 2007 and June 2007, but reduced them during July 2007,
especially in the shorter maturities. The majority of public sector
banks (PSBs) adjusted their deposit rates upwards by
10-25 basis points on maturities above one year, particularly at
the longer end. Interest rates offered by the PSBs on deposits
of above one-year maturity moved up from 7.25-9.50 per cent in
March 2007 to 7.25-9.60 per cent in July 2007. Private sector
banks’ deposit rates for one year and up to three years maturity
moved from 6.75-9.75 per cent in March 2007 to 6.75-10.25
per cent in July 2007, while interest rates on deposits greater
than three years maturity increased from 7.75-9.60 per cent to
7.50-10.00 per cent over the same period. The range of interest
rates offered by foreign banks on deposits of maturities above
one year remained largely unchanged at 2.50-9.50 per cent in
July 2007 compared to 3.50-9.50 per cent in March 2007. The
benchmark prime lending rates (BPLRs) of PSBs and private
sector banks moved from a range of 12.25-12.75 per cent and
12.00-16.50 per cent to 12.50-13.50 per cent and 13.00-17.25
per cent, respectively, in the same period. The range of BPLRs
for foreign banks was 10.00-15.50 per cent during the period.
33.
In the foreign exchange market, large surplus conditions
in the spot market were accompanied by a sharp increase in
average daily turnover in the foreign exchange market to
US $ 38.2 billion from a level of US $ 23.6 billion a year ago.
While the inter-bank turnover increased from US $ 17.1 billion to
18

US $ 27.7 billion, the merchant turnover increased from
US $ 6.5 billion to US $ 10.5 billion. Forward premia spiked in
April 2007 but in subsequent months, there has been a softening
across all maturities. The six-month forward premia eased from
3.60 per cent in March 2007 to 2.53 per cent by end-June 2007
and further to 1.28 per cent as on July 27, 2007.
34.
The equity markets were buoyant on the back of strong
corporate profitability, a positive investment climate and
sound fundamentals. The BSE Sensex (1978-79=100) increased
from 13,072 at end-March 2007 to cross the 15,000 level
on July 9, 2007 and reached 15,795 on July 24, 2007. On
July 27, 2007 the BSE Sensex declined to 15,235.
Developments in the External Sector
35.
The Reserve Bank’s end-June 2007 release sets out
balance of payments data for January-March 2007 and
preliminary data for the full year 2006-07. In US dollar terms,
merchandise export growth was maintained at 22.5 per cent in
2006-07 as against 23.4 per cent in the previous year.
Commodity-wise data released by the Directorate General of
Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S) indicate that
petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) exports recorded a growth of
59.4 per cent and accounted for 29.7 per cent of the total export
growth in 2006-07. Non-POL exports rose by 17.9 per cent, with
exports of both primary and manufactured products exhibiting
some moderation in growth in relation to the preceding year.
The growth in merchandise import payments also moderated
from 33.8 per cent in 2005-06 to 27.8 per cent in 2006-07.
Crude oil import growth moderated from 47.3 per cent in
2005-06 to 29.8 per cent in 2006-07, reflecting a growth of
19.3 per cent in volume terms and an increase of 12.7 per cent
19

in the average price of the Indian basket of international crude
which moved up to US $ 62.4 per barrel from US $ 55.3 per
barrel in the previous year. Net POL imports, i.e., POL imports
minus POL exports, were US $ 38.5 billion in 2006-07 as against
US $ 32.3 billion in 2005-06. Non-oil import payments increased
by 26.9 per cent mainly on account of rising imports of capital
goods, metalliferrous ores, metal scrap and gold and silver.
As a result, on a payments basis, the merchandise trade
deficit widened to US $ 64.9 billion (7.1 per cent of GDP) from
US $ 51.8 billion (6.4 per cent of GDP) in the previous year.
36.
During 2006-07, gross invisible receipts at US $ 119.2
billion amounted to as much as 94 per cent of merchandise
exports, recording an increase of 29.1 per cent. The sustained
growth of software exports as well as earnings from other
professional and business services and travel have provided
innate strength to the invisibles account in conjunction with
steadily rising inflows of remittance from overseas Indians. During
2006-07, invisible payments increased by 28.7 per cent, mainly
on account of a surge in outbound tourist traffic, imports of
business and management consultancy services, engineering
and technical services as well as dividend and profit payouts.
The net invisibles surplus rose to US $ 55.3 billion in 2006-07
from US $ 42.7 billion in the previous year. Accordingly, the
current account deficit (CAD) amounted to US $ 9.6 billion
(1.1 per cent of GDP), up from US $ 9.2 billion (1.1 per cent of
GDP) in 2005-06.
37.
Net capital flows were buoyant in 2006-07, nearly doubling
to US $ 44.9 billion from US $ 23.4 billion in 2005-06. Sizeable
increases in net inflows were received under foreign direct
investment (FDI), non-resident Indian (NRI) deposits, external
20

commercial borrowings (ECB), external assistance and
short-term credit while net portfolio inflows moderated in relation
to their levels in the preceding year. There was bi-directional
movement in direct investment flows with Indian corporates
exhibiting a strong appetite for global expansion. As regards
inward FDI, sectors such as manufacturing and construction,
financial and banking services and information technology
services were the main recipients in the net inflows of US $ 8.4
billion in 2006-07, sizeably higher than US $ 4.7 billion in
2005-06. Net ECB disbursements accounted for a third of total
net capital inflows in 2006-07, reflecting extremely favourable
conditions for Indian borrowers in the global financial markets.
Net portfolio inflows were lower at US $ 7.1 billion than
US $ 12.5 billion in 2005-06, partly due to volatility in Asian and
global equity markets in February-March 2007. On the other
hand, American Depository Receipts/Global Depository Receipts
(ADRs/GDRs) issuances remained buoyant as corporates took
advantage of favourable external market conditions to issue
equities abroad. NRI deposits increased by US $ 3.9 billion as
compared with US $ 2.8 billion in the previous year.
38.
Reflecting the movements in current and capital accounts
of the balance of payments, the accretion to foreign exchange
reserves (excluding valuation) amounted to US $ 36.6 billion
during 2006-07, higher than US $ 15.1 billion in 2005-06. The
level of foreign exchange reserves amounted to US $ 199.2
billion at the end of March 2007.
39.
India’s external debt increased by US $ 28.6 billion during
2006-07 and amounted to US $ 155 billion at end-March 2007.
While multilateral and bilateral debt registered moderate increase,
ECBs increased by 59.2 per cent, followed by trade credit and
21

NRI deposits. Valuation gains on account of the depreciation of
the US dollar vis-à-vis other major international currencies also
added to the stock of external debt. The US dollar had a dominant
share of 49.1 per cent in India’s external debt whereas
rupee-denominated debt had a share of 17.4 per cent. The
ratio of short-term debt to total debt increased marginally to
7.7 per cent at end-March 2007 from 6.9 per cent a year ago.
40.
During the first two months of 2007-08, developments in
the external sector indicate sustained strength and resilience.
Export growth rose to 20.2 per cent from 19.2 per cent in the
corresponding period of the previous year. Imports also posted
a sharp rise of 33.0 per cent as compared with 16.9 per cent in
the corresponding period of the previous year. Non-POL imports
rose by 47.3 per cent whereas oil imports remained broadly
stable at the level recorded a year ago. As a result, the
merchandise trade deficit widened to US $ 13.3 billion during
April-May 2007 from US $ 8.2 billion in April-May 2006.
41.
Available information points to a sizeable increase in net
capital flows during the current financial year in the main
components. Portfolio flows have picked up strongly on account
of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) which amounted to
US $ 8.4 billion during 2007-08 (up to July 13) as compared to
an outflow of US $ 2.0 billion in the corresponding period of
2006-07. Gross FDI inflows during April 2007 were placed at US
$ 1.6 billion as compared with US $ 0.7 billion a year ago.
Approvals for ECBs amounted to US $ 8.7 billion during AprilJune 2007 as compared with US $ 4.4 billion in the corresponding
period last year. On the other hand, there were net outflows
under NRI deposits of US $ 274 million in April 2007 as compared
with inflows of US $ 253 million during April 2006. ADR/GDR
22

issues by Indian companies amounted to US $ 11.0 million
during April 2007 as against an inflow of US $ 435 million in the
corresponding period in the previous year. The foreign exchange
reserves increased by US $ 22.9 billion and stood at US $ 222.0
billion on July 20, 2007.
42.
The exchange rate of the rupee against the US dollar,
which was Rs.43.59 at end-March 2007, appreciated sharply
thereafter to touch an intra-day high of Rs.40.28 per US dollar
on May 28, 2007 before reaching Rs.40.70 at end-June 2007.
The rupee appreciated against the euro from Rs.58.14 at
end-March 2007 to Rs.55.12 at end-June 2007, against the pound
sterling from Rs.85.53 at end-March 2007 to Rs.81.76 at
end-June 2007 and against the Japanese yen from Rs.36.89
per 100 yen to Rs.33.04 per 100 yen at end-June 2007. Overall,
during April-June 2007 the rupee appreciated by 6.63 per cent
against the US dollar, by 5.19 per cent against the euro, by
4.41 per cent against the pound sterling and by 10.44 per cent
against the Japanese yen. As on July 27, 2007 the exchange
rate of the rupee closed at Rs.40.52 per US dollar, Rs.55.35
per euro, Rs.82.28 per pound sterling and Rs.34.12 per 100
Japanese yen.
43.
On July 12, 2007 the Government announced a package
of measures to provide relief to exporters for a temporary period
in response to representations received in regard to exchange
rate movements. The package, involving an estimated outlay of
Rs.1,400 crore, included tax/duty concessions and other
measures such as concessional pre-shipment and post-shipment
credit by banks for small and medium exporters and enterprises
that export textiles, readymade garments, leather products,
handicrafts, engineering products, processed agricultural
23

products, marine products, sports goods and toys. Under the
scheme, interest subvention of 2 percentage points per annum
would be provided to all scheduled commercial banks in respect
of rupee export credit extended by them to the specified
categories of exporters.
44.
The exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided
by the broad principles of careful monitoring and management
of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or a
pre-announced target or a band, coupled with the ability to
intervene, if and when necessary. The overall approach to the
management of India’s foreign exchange reserves takes into
account the changing composition of the balance of payments
and endeavours to reflect the ‘liquidity risks’ associated with
different types of flows and other requirements.
Developments in the Global Economy
45.
World GDP growth, which had accelerated to
5.5 per cent in 2006, has maintained pace in the first half of
2007 and appears to have broadened across industrial and
emerging market countries. While consensus expectations
support a broad-based economic expansion for 2007, firm
inflationary pressures and high and volatile crude prices carry
risks to this outlook. According to the World Economic Outlook
(WEO) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released in
April 2007, global real GDP growth was expected to decline
from 5.4 per cent in 2006 to 4.9 per cent in 2007 and 2008. The
update of the WEO released in July 2007 has now revised this
forecast upwards to 5.5 per cent for 2006 and 5.2 per cent for
2007 and 2008.
46.
In the US, real GDP growth which had decelerated
to 0.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2007, accelerated to
24

3.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2007 as compared to
2.6 per cent a year ago, reflecting positive contributions from
narrowing trade deficit, commercial structures investment,
personal consumption expenditure and government spending,
partly offset by a decrease in residential fixed investment. Several
headwinds to growth are, however, evident in the weak growth
in incomes and consumer spending and the continued weakness
in the sub-prime housing sector which is spilling
over to higher quality credit market as also into debt and
equity markets.
47.
Real GDP in the euro area grew by 3.0 per cent in the
first quarter of 2007 on a year-on-year basis. Various surveys of
business and consumer confidence suggest firm growth
continuing in the second quarter. The WEO update places
average annual real GDP growth at 2.3 per cent in 2007 and
2.5 per cent in 2008. The unemployment rate in the euro-zone
fell in May to 7.0 per cent - the lowest level since 1993. Business
confidence remained buoyant in Europe in June 2007
with a step-up in investment and hiring. According to the
European Central Bank (ECB), interest rates still support
economic expansion, implying that further tightening is possible
going ahead.
48.
The Japanese economy grew by 2.6 per cent in the first
quarter of 2007 as compared with 3.0 per cent a year ago and
moderate expansion is likely to continue. Exports and business
fixed investment have risen steadily against the background of
high corporate profits. Household income has been rising
moderately, accompanied by firmness in private consumption.
Housing investment and production has been flat in the recent
period. Public investment has been declining as a trend.
25

49.
Emerging market economies (EMEs) have posted strong
growth in a relatively benign inflation environment. The strength
of macroeconomic performance has attracted significant capital
flows with net inflows of foreign private capital to the EMEs
reaching a level of US $ 256 billion in 2006. In some of the
EMEs, high investment growth, excessive lending, overhang of
liquidity, strengthening retail demand and imbalances in trade
and international payments pose risks to growth. In addition,
there are a number of downside risks emanating from the
behaviour of oil prices, adverse developments in the US housing
market, persistence of global imbalances, large leveraged
positions in financial markets and possible emergence of
inflationary pressures, especially from the foodgrains sector.
50.
In Asia, the EMEs have extended the run of robust
economic growth in a favourable global setting, strong commodity
prices and abundant global liquidity. The Chinese economy
accelerated by 11.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2007 as
compared with 11.5 per cent a year ago - the fastest in
11 years. Inflation in China was at 2.8 per cent in 2006 but has
risen steadily to 4.4 per cent in June 2007. China is expected to
grow by 11.2 per cent in 2007 but inflation may cross the central
bank’s target of 3.0 per cent to reach 3.2 per cent. With the
current phase of growth perceived as unstable and
environmentally unsustainable, macroeconomic management
policies have been tightened, including taxation measures aimed
at dampening speculative excesses in the stock market.
The People’s Bank of China (PBC) has raised interest rates
five times since April 2006 and has raised cash reserve
requirements nine times between July 2006 and July 2007. On
July 20, 2007 the PBC has cut the interest income tax to enhance
the attractiveness of bank deposits and reduce funds flow to the
26

stock markets which reached a record level in July. China ran a
record US $ 112.5 billion trade surplus in the first six months of
2007, 83 per cent more than in the same
period last year, which has contributed to the overhang of liquidity
in the economy. China’s foreign exchange reserves reached
US $ 1.33 trillion at the end of June 2007. The rising risks
of overheating, inflationary pressures, liquidity overhang,
expanding credit and surging stock markets point to further
monetary tightening.
51.
Among the other major Asian economies, the Korean
economy grew by 4.0 per cent in the first quarter of 2007, lower
than 6.3 per cent a year ago. Exports continued to show steady
growth, while investment and construction are picking up and
private consumption has recovered. The Korean economy
is expected to grow by 4.4 per cent in 2007, slower than
5.0 per cent in 2006. Consumer price inflation has accelerated
to 2.5 per cent in June 2007 from 1.7 per cent in January 2007.
The Bank of Korea has taken tightening steps in 2006 and 2007
by raising its policy rate, increasing reserve requirements, cutting
the ceiling on aggregate loans to commercial banks for lending
to small and medium enterprises and has attempted to curb the
steady rise in property prices by restricting mortgage
loan issuance to one contract per person, introduction of price
ceilings on new houses and disclosure of construction cost of
new homes.
52.
In Thailand, growth is projected to slow down to 4.5 per cent
for 2007 from 5.0 per cent recorded in 2006. In the first quarter,
the Thai economy has registered a growth of 4.3 per cent, from
6.1 per cent a year ago. The Bank of Thailand introduced a
series of measures to stem strong capital inflows into the
27

economy in 2006 and 2007, although monetary policy setting
has eased in the context of the slowdown in growth so far.
53.
Improved global wheat crop prospects, coupled with a
more positive supply outlook in major exporting countries could
result in a modest decline in international wheat prices in 2007.
Improvement in crop prospects is likely due to increase in winter
wheat plantings and favorable growing conditions.
At the onset of the new season, however, stocks in major
exporting countries are still small which is contributing to price
volatility in world markets. World trade in wheat in 2007-08 is
placed at 109 million tonnes with smaller imports by India and
higher export supplies from Australia. A series of setbacks have
severely impacted paddy production in 2006-07 and may result
in tightening of the demand-supply situation in world rice markets
in 2007. International rice prices followed a steady upward trend
between December 2006 and March 2007, but have stabilised
since then, largely influenced by falling export demand due to
the imposition of tight quality certification requirements in key
import markets. With large imports projected for the rest of the
year and limited current supplies in exporting countries, upward
pressure on international rice prices may continue over the next
few months. Despite the expected record world coarse grains
harvest in 2007 following increased plantings, international coarse
grains prices are likely to stay high in 2007-08 in response to
strong demand for ethanol production. Sugar prices, which
reached a 25-year high in early 2006, have declined since then
due to much larger global output than anticipated in most
cane-producing countries, particularly Brazil and India.
54.
Metal prices have increased by 15.6 per cent during the
first six months of 2007, over and above the increase of
28

53.6 per cent in 2006 and 36.3 per cent in 2005. According to
the futures markets, aluminum may gain in the rest of 2007,
while copper, nickel, zinc and tin are expected to decline. Gold
prices, which had sharply risen to their highest level in 26 years
in May 2006, are on a decline in the face of increased central
bank sales. On July 27, gold prices fell to US $ 659.50 per
ounce on renewed strength in the U.S. dollar and sharp declines
in the broader stock market indices.
55.
Spot crude oil prices softened from the July-August 2006
peak of US $ 78 per barrel to around US $ 53 per barrel
in January 2007 but have rebounded in July on expectations
of good demand, low US crude stocks, failure by the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to lift output and
a potentially harsh hurricane season to close at US $ 77 on
July 27, 2007. September 2007 future crude prices climbed to
US $ 77.02 per barrel on July 27, 2007.
56.
The inflation outlook remains a matter of concern on
account of energy and other commodity prices, increased
capacity utilisation rates in developed and major emerging
economies and the impact of rising wages on inflation in
advanced industrial economies. In the US, consumer prices
increased from 2.1 per cent in January 2007 to 2.7 per cent
in June 2007. In the euro area, inflation has remained at
1.9 per cent in March-June 2007. Inflation became zero in Japan
in April-May 2007 from 0.9 per cent in August 2006 and turned
negative at (-) 0.2 per cent in June 2007. In the UK, CPI inflation
declined to 2.4 per cent in June 2007. At the retail level, Retail
Prices Index (RPI) inflation rose to 4.8 per cent in the UK in
March 2007 - the highest since 1991 - but declined thereafter to
4.4 per cent in June 2007. Inflation pressures have raised
concerns in some of the EMEs.
29

57.
Core CPI inflation in the US decelerated to 2.2 per cent in
May-June 2007 as against 2.3 per cent in April 2007. In the UK,
core CPI inflation has been increasing in tandem with
the headline rate and stood at 2.0 per cent in June, up from
1.9 per cent in May 2007. In the euro area, core CPI inflation has
remained at the level of 1.9 per cent over March-June 2007.
Core inflation in Japan was negative (-0.4 per cent) in June 2007
as compared with (-) 0.3 per cent in May 2007. Globally, headline
inflation has picked up in the wake of increase in commodity
prices and core inflation has also generally remained firm.
58.
Global financial markets recovered from the turbulence
witnessed in February-March 2007. The buoyancy of the US
stock markets in the first quarter of 2007 continued in the second
quarter, aided by strength in manufacturing and strong merger
activity. Global mergers-and-acquisitions volume, fuelled by
private equity buyers mostly in the US market, surged in the first
half of 2007. In the second quarter of 2007, emerging market
spreads tightened to new historical lows as credit default spreads
fell and stock markets surged. Accordingly, in the first half of
2007, emerging markets outperformed stocks in developed
markets, led by Brazil, Turkey, China and Korea. Foreign investor
demand for emerging market assets was reflected in a broadbased rise in inflows into dedicated bond and equity markets of
the EMEs. Emerging market corporate bond issuance in
international bond markets rose to a record level in 2006. The
exposure of emerging markets to risky financial assets of the
mature markets has increased, and therefore, the overall global
financial risks have increased.
59.
In late July 2007, the fall in credit market confidence
brought on by the spread of the subprime loan risks into higher
30

quality debt, affected stock markets around the world. Share
prices fell by significant amounts on July 26 and 27, led by the
Dow Jones Industrial Average. This resulted in a decline in
sentiment in the international corporate bonds along with
emerging market debt. It has been reported that in response to
expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand may not
increase interest rates any further, there are indications of some
abatement of the yen carry trade. There are evolving uncertainties
in the direction of carry trade with implications for EMEs.
60.
Government bond yields in the major economies had,
until recently, firmed up. The US 10-year bond yield increased
from 4.70 per cent at end-December 2006 to 5.29 per cent on
June 12, 2007 before falling to 4.77 per cent on July 27, 2007.
The 10-year bond yield in the euro area increased from
3.95 per cent at end-December to 4.68 per cent on July 9, 2007
before falling to 4.33 per cent. The Japanese 10-year bond
yield has increased from 1.68 per cent at end-December to
1.97 per cent on June 13, 2007 before falling to 1.78 per cent.
These recent developments are indicative of evolving
uncertainties in international financial markets with implications
for EMEs.
61.
On a trade-weighted basis, the US dollar has been
depreciating since 2006 with intermittent fluctuations against most
major currencies, especially due to narrowing interest rate
advantage over other currencies. On July 24, 2007 the pound
sterling rose to a 26-year high of US $ 2.06 on concerns that the
emerging developments in the subprime mortgage market will
hurt the broader economy. The euro has also been strengthening
against the US dollar since June, after the ECB lifted its
benchmark rate, and rose to a record high on July 24, on investor
31

apprehension about the subprime mortgage market. The
Canadian dollar reached a 30-year high against the US dollar
on July 6, 2007 ahead of an expected rate hike by the Bank of
Canada, and appreciated further to a new peak on July 24,
2007. Turkey experienced a sharp appreciation in its currency
vis-à-vis the euro and the US dollar on July 2, 2007 boosted by
strong economic performance and large capital inflows. The New
Zealand dollar had appreciated to 81.10 cents to reach a
22-year peak against the US dollar on July 24, 2007. The Reserve
Bank of New Zealand had to intervene in the foreign exchange
market on June 11, 2007 for the first time since 1985. These
unusual developments in the currency markets in recent months
are indicative of heightened uncertainties, giving rise to significant
challenges for monetary management in EMEs.
62.
Perceptions of inflation pressures ahead have prompted
monetary authorities generally to persevere in withdrawing
monetary accommodation. The central banks that have tightened
their policy rates include the ECB which has raised its policy
rates eight times since December 2005 by 25 basis points each
to 4.00 per cent (main refinancing rate); the Bank of England
(repo rate raised in August and November 2006, January, May
and July 2007 by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent); the Bank of
Japan (uncollateralised overnight rate target at 0.25 and
0.50 per cent in July 2006 and February 2007, respectively,
after maintaining a zero interest rate policy since September
2001); the Bank of Canada to 4.50 per cent (in July 2007); the
Reserve Bank of Australia (Cash Rate raised by 25 basis points
each in August and November 2006 to 6.25 per cent); the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand (Official Cash Rate raised to
8.25 per cent by five 25 basis points hikes in December 2005
and March, April, June and July 2007); the People’s Bank
32

of China (lending rate raised five times to 6.84 per cent between
April 2006 and July 2007); the Bank of Korea (target overnight
call rate raised by 25 basis points to 4.50 per cent in August
2006 and 4.75 per cent in July 2007); the Banco de Mexico
(benchmark overnight lending rate raised to 7.25 per cent
in April 2007 from 7.0 per cent since April 2006); and the
Banco Central de Chile (benchmark lending rate raised to
5.25 per cent in July 2007 from 5.00 per cent since
January 2007).
63.
A few central banks have used supplementary measures
for tightening, besides increasing the key policy rates such as
increases in reserve requirements. In China, the required reserve
ratio was raised by 50 basis points each effective from July 5,
August 15 and November 15 in 2006 and on January 15,
February 25, April 16, May 15, June 5 and August 15 in 2007.
The required reserve ratio in China is now 12.0 per cent. The
Bank of Korea raised reserve requirements from 5 per cent to
7 per cent for local currency deposits and short-term foreign
currency deposits, after a gap of 17 years, in November and
December 2006, respectively. Meanwhile, in several EMEs
including China and Korea, central bank bonds have continued
to absorb liquidity from the banking system.
64.
Some central banks have paused in their policy cycles,
particularly the US. The pause of the Federal Reserve since
August 2006 came after seventeen increases by 25 basis points
each between June 2004 and June 2006. Other central banks
that have kept their policy rates steady include the Bank Negara
Malaysia (Overnight Policy Rate at 3.5 per cent since April 2006).
65.
Some other central banks have cut back their policy rates
in recent months, usually on the back of earlier strong actions to
33

contain inflation. These include Bank Indonesia (BI) (BI rate
reduced from 12.50 per cent in May 2006 to 8.25 per cent
in July 2007); the Bank of Thailand (1-day repurchase rate
reduced from 4.75 per cent in January 2007 to 3.25 per cent in
July 2007 in four stages); and the Banco Central do Brasil
(Selic rate target cut between September 2005 and July 2007 to
11.50 per cent).
Overall Assessment
66.
There are indications that a strong momentum of activity
has been sustained in the Indian economy in the early months
of 2007-08. Aggregate supply conditions appear to have firmed
up mainly on the back of high growth in industry and services.
67.
Industrial output has risen faster than consensus market
expectations in April and May 2007, extending a run of
consecutive months of double-digit growth that began in
November 2006. The acceleration in industrial activity
continues to reflect the performance of manufacturing which
has recorded double-digit growth through April 2006 to
May 2007, with October 2006 being the sole outlier.
Infrastructure output growth has also picked up in April-May
2007, led by electricity generation, steel and crude petroleum
production with some deceleration in cement production due
to capacity constraints. Several infrastructure industries,
notably petroleum refineries, steel and cement are operating at
above 90 per cent capacity utilisation.
68.
Lead indicators, particularly cargo handled in major ports,
cell phone connections, passengers handled at domestic and
international terminals, road upgradation and banking and
financial sector activity seem to point to the recent pace of
34

growth of services sector activity being maintained in the first
quarter of 2007-08.
69.
On the agricultural front, the outlook is somewhat unclear
and would depend on the spread and intensity of the south-west
monsoon. Up to June 2007, rainfall has been significantly above
the LPA for the country as a whole although somewhat deficient
over central India. While the live water storage in important
reservoirs appears to have dipped below the level a year ago,
it still remains higher than the average of the last ten years.
The area sown under various kharif crops was lower than a year
ago in respect of all major crops, except cotton and oilseeds.
The progress of the monsoon and a fuller assessment of crop
sowing situation will enable a more informed appraisal of the
likely performance of agriculture over the rest of the year.
70.
While growth in industry and services has accelerated in
recent years, stagnation in the productivity levels of major crops
and overall volatility of agricultural output have emerged as issues
of serious policy concern. It is in this context that the Planning
Commission has targeted a growth rate of 4 per cent per annum
in the agricultural sector, which is necessary not only to ensure
food security but also to enable inclusive growth.
71.
Aggregate demand pressures remain in evidence,
although there are signs of some moderation beginning to set
in. The current pace of growth continues to be driven by private
investment and consumption demand which has so far been
supported by resilient corporate profitability and business
confidence, stretched capacity utilisation, rising incomes and
ongoing capacity expansion, including in infrastructure.
The growth of the production of capital goods in April-May 2007
35

has been somewhat slower than a year ago; nevertheless, the
sustained vigour of the expansion, together with the surge in
non-oil imports in April and May 2007, is indicative of the strength
of investment demand which continues to maintain the upturn in
capital spending by the corporate sector. Second-round demand
pressures are also visible in the pick-up in the growth of
intermediate goods production in April-May 2007 on top of the
smart turnaround recorded in 2006-07. Consumer demand has
also firmed up further in the early months of 2007-08 from rising
levels in 2006-07 as evident in the sizeable increase in the
production of consumer goods, particularly consumer
non-durables, which appear to be on a high growth trajectory
since March 2007. Monetary and banking aggregates continue
to rise at persistently high rates. While there is a moderate
slackening of non-food bank credit growth, banks’ investments
in mutual funds have increased sizeably. There are also reports
of stretched capacity in the cement sector and some slowdown
in the commercial vehicles and auto parts industries. Export
demand continues to remain strong, except in some industries
facing capacity constraints and rising cost conditions as in textiles,
but a sharp pick-up in non-oil imports has resulted in a widening
of the merchandise trade deficit, indicating the spillover of
domestic demand.
72.
A heartening feature of recent macroeconomic
developments has been the decline in headline inflation from
the late January 2007 peak to within the policy tolerance threshold
by end-May. This is attributable to the pass-through of monetary,
fiscal and supply-side measures in conjunction with seasonal
factors especially the moderation of food prices with the arrival
of the rabi harvest. Accordingly, inflation in terms of primary
articles has fallen significantly from double-digits recorded in
36

January-May 2007. With foodgrains production expected to
increase during the 2006-07 agriculture year, coupled with early
indications of a favourable south-west monsoon, pressures on
prices of key foodgrains such as wheat and rice in India
may ease somewhat, although global wheat prices were at a
11-year high in June 2007 and prices of oilseeds remain subject
to upward pressures over the near term. The decline in the
prices of the ‘fuel’ category has also enabled some easing of
headline WPI inflation so far.
73.
International crude prices have risen beyond the US $ 70
level and are extremely volatile, representing a serious risk to
inflation expectations. Even with the EIA projection of US $ 65.7
per barrel in 2007, international crude prices would remain
considerably higher than the level of US $ 53 per barrel at the
beginning of the year. Domestic prices of petrol and diesel, on
the other hand, have undergone two downward revisions during
2006-07 and at their current levels, it is necessary to recognise
the need for some more pass-through from recent movements
in international crude prices. It is difficult to differentiate,
ex ante, the permanent and temporary components of the
elevated international crude prices but, in any case, they would
have implications for domestic inflation conditions.
74.
A positive feature of recent developments has been the
encouraging response of banks to the sustained policy emphasis
and actions for ensuring credit quality and overall financial
stability. Rebalancing of banks’ balance sheets seems to be
underway, captured by movements in key banking aggregates.
Beginning in the last quarter of 2006-07, a dip in non-food credit
growth from the persistent high rates that prevailed during
2004-07 has turned into a steady deceleration in broad alignment
37

with the indicative trajectory given in the Annual Policy Statement
of April 2007. While the slowdown reflects, in part, the usual
seasonal decline in bank credit that occurs at this time of the
year, there has also been some deceleration in bank lending to
sectors such as real estate, housing, computer software, trade
and transport operators in response to rising lending rates, shifts
in banks’ portfolios in favour of investments in gilts and prudential
considerations. On the other hand, there are indications of a
pick-up in credit demand from agriculture and industry, in
particular, infrastructure. Banks have aggressively mobilised time
deposits (including certificates of deposit) with aggregate
deposit growth in the first quarter of 2007-08 outstripping the
11-year high recorded in 2006-07. Accordingly, the incremental
non-food credit deposit ratio (year-on-year) has come off
appreciably from the average level of 115 per cent prevailing in
the preceding two years. These readjustments augur well for
the health of the banking system by reducing asset-liability
mismatches and attendant balance sheet risks.
75.
Finances of the Union Government in April-May 2007
exhibited some improvement with the gross fiscal deficit and the
revenue deficit declining from their levels a year ago. Gross tax
collections have increased significantly and already account for
close to a fifth of the budget estimates. Total expenditure has
declined in the first two months of 2007-08, with a contraction of
20 per cent in Plan expenditure being partly offset by a moderate
increase in the non-Plan component. A noteworthy aspect of
recent developments in the Centre’s finances is the pick-up in
capital expenditure, which is conducive for the overall investment
outlook. While the borrowing programme of the Centre in terms
of dated securities has progressed broadly in alignment with the
calendar set in the beginning of the year, there has been higher
38

recourse to short-term borrowings through Treasury Bills to
manage the exceptional circumstances discussed earlier.
76.
Financial markets have experienced large swings in
liquidity conditions and heightened volatility within a general
softening of interest rates across the spectrum, except in the
credit market. Money markets, and in particular, the overnight
segments, have experienced excess liquidity released into the
system through a drawdown of the Central Government’s cash
balances to overdrafts on two occasions in the current financial
year so far. Capital flows and the Central Government’s cash
balances have been the principal sources of volatility in systemic
liquidity, with the former being tempered by sterilisation measures.
The Central Government’s cash balances maintained with the
Reserve Bank came down from Rs.65,582 crore in December
2006 to Rs.49,992 crore at the end of March 2007 and further to
a debit of Rs.7,753 crore in May 2007, a turnaround of Rs.73,335
crore in a span of five months.
77.
In the domestic financial markets, money markets have
experienced some volatility amidst surplus liquidity conditions.
Generally stable and orderly conditions have been observed in
the government securities market. Yield spreads have widened,
especially for corporate bonds. In the credit markets, both deposit
and lending rates have edged up, the former more conspicuously.
In the forex market, there have been strong and persistent upward
pressures on the exchange rate.
78.
Developments in the external sector in the first quarter of
2007-08 reflect the underlying strength of economic activity.
Merchandise export growth has picked up in April-May 2007 in
relation to a year ago. Information available up to February
39

2007 indicates that engineering goods and petroleum products
are the drivers of exports. With POL imports holding at broadly
the level in the corresponding period of 2006-07, a jump in
non-oil import growth has widened the merchandise trade deficit.
Lagged data on the composition of imports suggest that capital
goods, industrial raw materials, gold and electronic goods are
the main components, indicative of the strength of domestic
investment and consumption demand. Despite the expansion of
the trade deficit by close to US $ 5 billion in relation to its level a
year ago, there has been a sizeable accretion to the foreign
exchange reserves over the first quarter of 2007-08.
79.
India’s macroeconomic performance in the first quarter of
2007-08 needs to be assessed in the context of global
developments and the evolving international environment. While
global growth had shown some signs of moderation in the first
quarter of 2007, there has been a gain in momentum in more
recent months, leading to upward revisions in consensus
forecasts. Demand pressures appear to be holding up economic
activity in the mature economies, stronger than expected. While
headline inflation has remained generally steady, inflationary
pressures remain and seem to be more persistent than before,
along with elevated levels of commodity and asset prices. Risks
to inflation expectations have also heightened with international
crude prices rising again and with crude futures firming up.
In particular, uncertainty relating to supplies have increased,
building a risk premium into the evolution of crude prices. In the
EMEs, the outlook continues to be optimistic with early indications
of strengthening growth. Business and consumer sentiment
appears to be positive and some EMEs have experienced a
moderate decline in unemployment, particularly in Asia and Latin
America. At the same time, concerns have arisen regarding the
40

sustainability of high growth. For most Asian EMEs (AEMEs),
inflationary pressures are being reinforced by rising food and
fuel prices along with ample liquidity and rapidly rising credit,
largely driven by excess capital flows.
80.
In the global financial markets, the volatility experienced
in the first quarter of 2007, triggered by concerns about the
US subprime mortgage market and potential economy-wide
effects, seems to have been repeated recently in late July. After
the February 2007 events, there had been a rapid recovery of
prices for all asset classes, including for EMEs. Long-term interest
rates have risen in the mature markets since May, driving up gilt
yields. Global equity prices have risen rapidly along with
long-term interest rates until mid-July, reflecting upward revisions
in growth prospects and profit expectations. Equity markets have
also revealed an increasing synchronicity across mature and
emerging economies. The current phase of market activity, along
with a revision in expectations on the direction of future monetary
policy changes, appears to have triggered a reassessment of
risks by financial markets. Nonetheless, current indications
suggest that the risks, including geopolitical risks, remain underpriced and widely spread.
81.
Risks to the outlook for global growth and financial markets
from the prolonged slump in the US housing market have become
accentuated with the adverse developments in the subprime
mortgage market that surfaced in late 2006 and has continued
into 2007. In the recent period, solvency threats to hedge funds
with large subprime exposure have increased the danger of
‘event risk’ in leveraged loan and junk bond markets from the
collapse in prices of illiquid or ‘hard-to-trade’ securities linked to
subprime loans. Limits on redemptions by several hedge funds
41

and the ensuing flight to quality has raised concerns that
contagion could spread across credit markets and corporate
bond markets in a spiral of repricing, tighter mortgage and
borrowing conditions, falling house prices and slower consumption
growth which could ultimately drag down US and global economic
growth. Regulators and monetary authorities have expressed
concern about the vulnerability of the global financial system
due to excessive leveraging and gaps in creditor supervision in
the context of rising levels of widely diffused risks.
82.
Hedge funds are private, largely unregulated pools of
capital. Their role has risen significantly with systemic implications
and they have added depth and breadth to financial markets.
Managers of hedge funds follow complex investment strategies
to leverage portfolio size through sophisticated derivative
contracts. While their potential for imparting risks to the financial
system has always been engaging the attention of regulators, in
the recent period there is a heightened awareness of possible
threats to overall financial stability. With greater risk aversion
going forward, with credit quality deteriorating and with the
widening of credit spreads, the potential fragility of hedge funds
could pose significant risks to financial market stability and to
the prospects for financing and growth in the EMEs.
83.
It is estimated that the private equity industry accounted
for more than a quarter of global mergers and acquisitions in the
first half of 2007. In consonance with the boom in private equity,
particularly since 2006, there has been the incidence of higher
leverage to enhance investment returns. In view of the opaque
nature of private equity activity, the high levels of leveraging has
raised concerns about longer-term sustainability. Recent events
have shown that counterparties could have grossly
42

underestimated the riskiness of individual funds, and the
vulnerability of the markets in which they are active, to sudden
turns in sentiment or even tightening of credit conditions. Given
the size of business accruing to private equity, they carry risks
to overall macroeconomic stability and, in particular, to EMEs.
84.
It is in the context of these developments that monetary
policy authorities remain hawkish and vigilant about threats to
inflation expectations and volatility in money and currency
markets. In the face of fluctuations in asset prices, underpricing
of risks and disorderly adjustments, several central banks have
acted pre-emptively in the early months of 2007 to tighten
monetary policy. A few central banks, in particular those in the
Asian EMEs, have reinforced the increases in key policy rates
with increases in reserve requirements and in some cases, with
non-monetary measures.
85.
In the overall assessment, therefore, domestic economic
activity has continued to expand at a strong pace and there are
indications that the impulses of growth are getting broad-based.
The recent gains in bringing down inflation and in stabilising
inflation expectations should support the current expansionary
phase of the growth cycle. While noting the inflation environment
in recent weeks, it is necessary to continuously assess the risks
to the inflation outlook emanating from high and volatile
international crude prices, the continuing firmness in key
food prices and the uncertainties surrounding the evolution of
demand-supply gaps globally as well as in India. It is also
necessary to note that demand pressures and cyclical effects
persist, mirrored in investment and consumer demand, monetary
and banking aggregates, capacity constraints and a widening
trade deficit. Financial markets are reflecting the interplay of
43

these factors, although surges in capital inflows and large
changes in liquidity conditions are obscuring an accurate
assessment of risks, with attendant uncertainty. It is necessary
to note that while there is an abatement of inflation in the recent
period, upward pressures persist. In this regard, it is essential to
carefully monitor developments relating to aggregate supply
conditions and the supply response to the impulses of demand
in the short-term, while stepping up efforts to expand production
capabilities over the medium-term.
86.
Risks from global developments continue to persist,
especially in the form of inflationary pressures, re-pricing of risks
by financial markets and danger of downturn in some asset
classes, with implications for EMEs in general. International food
and energy prices are likely to settle at higher levels than before
with indications that the sharp acceleration recorded in 2006 will
not reverse. In addition, there are risks emanating from the
developments in global financial markets. While excessive
leveraging by hedge funds and private equity has enhanced the
vulnerability of the global financial system, exchange rate
fluctuations in respect of the major currencies have become
amplified with large changes in the magnitude and direction of
capital flows.
87.
Given the flux associated with both financial markets and
monetary policy settings, India cannot be immune to these
developments. Accordingly, banks, financial institutions and
corporates are advised to be vigilant and well-prepared with
appropriate risk mitigation strategies to deal with significantly
higher volatility than before. It is in this context that they are
urged to monitor various types of exposures, including economic
exposure, and to ensure hedging of currency and interest rate
44

risks to balance sheets that might impact the quality of assets. It
may be noted that the Reserve Bank has expanded the range of
hedging tools available to market participants and facilitated
dynamic hedging.

II. Stance of Monetary Policy for the
Remaining Period of 2007-08
88.
In April 2007, at the time of the Annual Policy Statement
for 2007-08, global growth was expected to moderate and
inflationary pressures were seen as persisting worldwide. With
demand pressures having intensified in the domestic economy
along with supply-side constraints, the Annual Policy Statement
reiterated the stance set out in January 2007 of reinforcing the
emphasis on price stability and well-anchored inflation
expectations so as to enable continuation of the growth
momentum. Credit quality and orderly financial markets were
re-emphasised in conjunction with greater credit penetration and
financial inclusion. The Annual Policy Statement also reaffirmed
the resolve to respond swiftly with all possible measures to
developments impinging on inflation expectations and the growth
momentum. It was recognised that the likely evolution of
macroeconomic and financial conditions indicates an environment
supportive of sustaining the current growth momentum and that
the Indian economy is possibly poised on the threshold of a
step-up in the growth trajectory, but that there is evidence of
some cyclical elements embedded in the structural change.
Noting that the overarching policy challenge is to manage the
transition to a higher growth path while containing inflationary
pressures, the policy preference for the period ahead was
indicated as strongly in favour of price stability and well-anchored
45

inflation expectations with the endeavour being to contain inflation
close to 5.0 per cent in 2007-08 and to the range of 4.0–4.5
per cent over the medium-term.
89.
On a review, the prospects for growth in 2007-08 appear
positive at the current juncture. The IMD has maintained its
initial forecasts of rainfall at 93 per cent of the LPA for the
country as a whole in the 2007 south-west monsoon season.
Accordingly, by current indications, a return to trend growth in
agriculture should be realisable. Growth in industrial and service
sector activity, which constitute more than 80 per cent of the
economy and contribute over 94 per cent of headline growth, is
expected to be sustained, given the current momentum of
expansion despite evolving uncertainties observed in recent
weeks. Overall, for policy purposes, the projection of real GDP
growth in 2007-08 at around 8.5 per cent, as set out in the
Annual Policy Statement of April 2007, is retained, barring
domestic or external shocks.
90.
There are indications that the combination of lagged and
cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and fiscal and
administrative measures for supply management has had a
salutary effect on inflation expectations, and headline inflation
has turned benign in sharp contrast to the last quarter of
2006-07. Going forward, monetary management would need to
be watchful of movements in commodity prices, particularly oil
prices, the elevated levels of asset prices and the re-emergence
of pricing power among producers as potential threats to inflation
expectations. Assuming that aggregate supply management will
continue to receive public policy attention and that a more active
management of the capital account will be demonstrated, the
outlook for inflation in 2007-08 remains unchanged. Accordingly,
46

holding headline inflation within 5.0 per cent in 2007-08 assumes
priority in the policy hierarchy; while reinforcing the
medium-term objective to condition policy and perceptions to
reduce inflation to 4.0-4.5 per cent on a sustained basis.
91.
For the purpose of monetary policy formulation, the
Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 projected the rate of
money supply (M3) at around 17.0-17.5 per cent for 2007-08 in
consonance with the outlook on growth and inflation. Consistent
with the projections of money supply, the growth in aggregate
deposits in 2007-08 was placed at around Rs.4,90,000 crore
while non-food credit including investments in bonds/debentures/
shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sector
and commercial paper (CP) was projected to decelerate to
24.0-25.0 per cent in 2007-08 from the average of 29.8 per cent
over 2004-07. While non-food credit growth has decelerated,
the acceleration in money supply and reserve money warrants
an appropriate response.
92.
Recent developments in the external sector indicate that
the overall trade and current account deficits in 2007-08 are
evolving as per expectations. However, net capital flows have
been very strong so far in the current financial year. Early fiscal
indicators suggest that the Centre’s fiscal deficit is evolving as
budgeted and is on course to meet the targets set in the
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003.
93.
By current reckoning, the global outlook is positive with
continuing prospects for strong and stable growth but there
are concerns about inflationary pressures worldwide. Monetary
authorities are inclined to regard the current levels of real
interest rates as warranting further withdrawal of monetary
47

accommodation and are indicating a preparedness to respond
to the manner in which the inflation scenario evolves. Financial
markets have been aggressively re-pricing risks; however, the
wide diffusion of risks and the abundance of liquidity has imparted
considerable uncertainty. Visitations of volatility in equity and
currency markets with worldwide ramifications have imparted an
additional dimension of uncertainty to the evolution of the
international economic environment. These developments are
necessitating intensified policy monitoring with a policy preference
for insulating domestic real activity from these shocks. Looking
ahead, monetary policy in India would continue to be vigilant
and pro-active in the context of any accentuation of global
uncertainties that pose threats to growth and stability in the
domestic economy. The domestic outlook continues to be
favourable and would dominate the dynamic setting of monetary
policy in the period ahead. It is important to design monetary
policy such that it protects growth by contributing to
the maintenance of stability. Accordingly, while the stance
of monetary policy would continue to reinforce the emphasis
on price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations
and thereby sustain the growth momentum, contextually,
financial stability may assume greater importance in the months
to come.
94.
Keeping the above in view, recent developments in
financial markets in India and potential uncertainties in global
markets warrant a higher priority for managing appropriate liquidity
conditions in the policy hierarchy at the current juncture.
95.
The Reserve Bank will continue with its policy of active
demand management of liquidity through appropriate use of the
CRR stipulations and open market operations (OMO) including
48

the MSS and LAF, using all the policy instruments at its disposal
flexibly, as and when the situation warrants.
96.
In sum, barring the emergence of any adverse and
unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy
and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy
including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary
policy in the period ahead will broadly continue to be:
•

To reinforce the emphasis on price stability and
well-anchored inflation expectations while ensuring a
monetary and interest rate environment that supports
export and investment demand in the economy so
as to enable continuation of the growth momentum.

•

To re-emphasise credit quality and orderly conditions
in financial markets for securing macroeconomic and,
in particular, financial stability while simultaneously
pursuing greater credit penetration and financial
inclusion.

•

To respond swiftly with all possible measures as
appropriate to the evolving global and domestic
situation impinging on inflation expectations, financial
stability and the growth momentum.

III. Monetary Measures
(a)
97.
