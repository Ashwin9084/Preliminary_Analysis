First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2013-14
By
Dr. D. Subbarao
Governor
Introduction

2.
On the domestic front, the
foreign exchange market came under
severe stress starting late May,
prompting the Reserve Bank to initiate
liquidity tightening measures to contain
the volatility. As regards economic
activity, risks to growth have increased
notwithstanding the robust onset and
spread of the monsoon. Industrial
production has slumped, with lead
indications of declining order books
and input price pressures building on
rupee depreciation. Meanwhile,
depressed global conditions are
undermining export performance, even
as heightened volatility in capital flows
has raised external funding risks.
Wholesale price inflation pressures are
on the ebb, but retail inflation remains
high. Monetary policy going forward
will be shaped by the considerations of
supporting growth, anchoring inflation
expectations and maintaining external
sector stability.

Since early May when the
Reserve Bank issued its Monetary
Policy Statement for 2013-14, global
growth has been uneven and slower than
initially expected. The tail risks to
global recovery had eased in the early
part of the year, but that improvement
was overtaken by the turmoil in financial
markets because of the ‘announcement
effect’ of the likely tapering of
quantitative easing (QE) by the US Fed.
In advanced economies (AEs), activity
has weakened. Emerging and developing
economies (EDEs) are slowing, and are
also experiencing sell-offs in their
financial markets, largely due to the safe
haven flight of capital. Market
expectations of QE taper and the
consequent increase in real interest rates
in the US have translated into a rapid
appreciation of the US dollar and
consequent depreciation of EDE
currencies. Commodity prices have
generally softened, but the price of
crude remains elevated. Although the
inflation outlook in AEs is still benign,
upside risks remain in several EDEs.

3.
In the above context, this
Statement should be read and understood
together with the detailed review in

Developments released yesterday by the
Reserve Bank.

II sets out the domestic outlook and
projections for growth, inflation and
monetary aggregates. Section III
explains the stance of monetary policy.
Section IV specifies the monetary
measures.

4.
This Statement is organised in
four Sections: Section I provides an
overview of global and domestic
macroeconomic developments. Section

I. The State of the Economy
Global Economy

benign due to weak demand conditions.
Inflation dropped sharply in Russia in
June due to softening food prices.

5.
Global economic activity remains
subdued with still elevated downside
risks. In the US, incoming data point to
a slower recovery in domestic demand
and weak export activity. In the UK,
recovery is gradually gathering
momentum on the back of consumer
spending. The euro area continues to be
in recession with high unemployment.
Japan’s economy is returning to positive
growth with improved industrial
production and retail sales.

8.
Non-fuel commodity prices have
been easing, reflecting subdued global
demand and comfortable supply levels.
On the other hand, energy prices have
firmed up due to a decline in US crude
oil inventories and geo-political tensions
in the Middle East.
Domestic Economy
9.
Domestic economic activity
weakened in Q1 of 2013-14. Lead
indicators point to continuing headwinds
facing manufacturing and services sector
activity.

6.
Among the BRICS countries,
although retail sales in China have
maintained the impetus of recent months,
the manufacturing purchasing managers’
index (PMI) and industrial production
declined in June. Growth has clearly lost
momentum in Brazil, Russia and South
Africa.

10.
Industrial production remained
muted at 0.1 per cent during April-May;
in May, there was an absolute decline of
1.6 per cent spread across all constituent
sub-sectors, barring electricity
generation. Capital goods production
continues to contract, reflecting
deteriorating investment conditions.
Although the manufacturing PMI
improved modestly in June, the pace of

Inflation remains subdued in AEs,
but in several EDEs upside pressures
persist. In China, inflation quickened in
June, although it is expected to stay

expansion was anaemic. With the decline
in the services sector PMI in June, the
composite PMI fell too, suggesting
broad-based sluggishness in economic
activity.

inflation declined due to the reduction in
coal prices in March 2013, supported by
base effects in the case of electricity
prices. Non-food manufactured products
inflation fell to 2.0 per cent in June, the
lowest since December 2009, mainly due
to a decline in inflation in respect of
chemicals and continuing deflation in
metal prices.

11.
Spurred by the timely arrival of
the monsoon and above long period
average rainfall so far (17 per cent excess
up to July 26, 2013), kharif sowing has
been significantly higher than a year ago,
with total sown area at 74.8 million
hectares as on July 26 as against 63.5
million hectares recorded by the same
time last year. To date, all regions, except
the east and the northeast, have received
normal/excess rainfall.

14.
Retail inflation, as measured by
the Consumer Price Index [(CPI) new
series], had moderated somewhat during
April-May, but it surged close to double
digits in June, driven primarily by a sharp
increase in food prices.
15.
Among other indicators, urban
households’ inflation expectations, as per
the latest round of the Reserve Bank’s
survey, remained at elevated levels in
Q2. Rural wages, which had been rising
at an annual average of 20 per cent for
28 months, moderated since January
2013. According to the Reserve Bank’s
quarterly house price index, increase in
house prices also moderated in Q4 of
2012-13.

12.
The deceleration in new orders
growth reported in the Reserve Bank’s
order books, inventories and capacity
utilisation survey (OBICUS) indicates
low activity levels in Q1. This is
corroborated by the Reserve Bank’s
industrial outlook survey (IOS) which
indicates that the overall business
sentiment remained subdued in Q1 and
may improve only marginally in Q2.
Early results of corporate performance
in Q1 suggest that sales growth and profit
margins remained subdued.

16.
Money supply (M3), at 12.8 per
cent y-o-y on July 12, was close to the
indicative trajectory of 13.0 per cent. On
the other hand, non-food credit growth
at 14.3 per cent was lower than the
indicative projection of 15.0 per cent,
with the slowdown spread across all
major sectors. The Reserve Bank’s credit
conditions survey shows that overall
credit conditions are expected to remain

13.
Headline inflation, as measured
by the wholesale price index (WPI),
edged up slightly to 4.9 per cent in June
2013 after declining for five months on
a clip. The pickup was mainly driven by
a spurt in food inflation, especially in
respect of vegetables and cereals. Fuel

broadly unchanged in Q2, though some
tightening is expected in sectors such as
construction, infrastructure, commercial
real estate and finance.

declined by 5 basis points (bps) during
Q1. Although the modal base rate
remained unchanged during the quarter,
the weighted average lending rate
(WALR) on the outstanding rupee loans
of SCBs declined by 6 bps during Q1.
The WALR for fresh loans, particularly
for housing and commercial vehicles
sectors, declined significantly during this
period.

17.
The flow of resources to the
commercial sector, from both bank and
non-bank sources, at `2.6 trillion in
2013-14 so far (up to July 12), was higher
than a year ago. While the contribution
of domestic non-bank sources declined,
there was an increase in resources raised
from domestic banks and from abroad,
especially through external commercial
borrowings (ECBs) and foreign direct
investment (FDI).

20.
During April-May, the Central
Government’s key deficit indicators as a
proportion to the budget estimates were
higher than a year ago, mainly on
account of higher plan and capital
expenditures, and decline in tax revenues
by as much as 7.9 per cent. Up to July
25, 40.8 per cent of the net market
borrowings of the Central Government
was completed.

18.
Liquidity conditions have eased
considerably since the May Policy. The
average daily net liquidity injection
under the liquidity adjustment facility
(LAF) declined to `828 billion during
Q1 from `1,078 billion during Q4 of
2012-13. Government balances have
been in deficit since June 28 and have
bolstered liquidity, thereby significantly
reducing the demand for funds under
the LAF. The net drawal from the LAF
declined significantly during the first
week of July. On July 26, it stood at
`558 billion [including `229 billion
from the marginal standing facility
(MSF)].

21.
The CAD moderated to 3.6 per
cent of GDP in Q4 of 2012-13, down
from 6.5 per cent in Q3, due to a
narrowing of the trade deficit. However,
for the year 2012-13 as a whole, the CAD
was 4.8 per cent of GDP, well above the
sustainable level of 2.5 per cent of GDP
estimated by the Reserve Bank.
22.
In the current year, the trade
deficit widened during Q1 over its level
a year ago, mainly on account of
deteriorating export performance.
Financing came by way of higher FDI,
net ECBs and accretion to non-resident
deposits, with some use of reserves.

19.
Following the reduction in the
repo rate in May and easing of liquidity
conditions, the modal term deposit rate
of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs)

23.
Beginning late May, following
some comments of the US Fed,
4

apprehensions of likely tapering of QE
in the US triggered outflows of portfolio
investment, particularly from the debt
segment. Several measures were
instituted to contain the ensuing exchange
market volatility and to reverse
unidirectional expectations. First, to curb
import demand, import of gold on
consignment basis was restricted on June
4 and customs duty was raised on June
5. Second, this was followed up on July
8 with further measures, including
restricting banks to trade only on behalf
of their clients in currency futures/
options markets, tightening of exposure
norms, and raising margins on currency
derivatives to check speculative
activities.

the Reserve Bank opened a dedicated
Special Repo window for a notified
amount of `250 billion for liquidity
support to mutual funds.
25.
On July 22, the Reserve Bank
rationalised import of gold by making it
incumbent on all nominated banks/
entities to ensure that at least one fifth of
imported gold is exclusively made
available for the purpose of exports. Any
import of gold under any type of scheme
will have to follow this 20/80 formula.
Consequent to this, the earlier instructions
banning the import of gold on
consignment basis were withdrawn.
26.
On July 23, the Reserve Bank
modified the liquidity tightening
measures by regulating access to LAF
by way of repos at each individual bank
level and restricting it to 0.5 per cent of
the bank’s own NDTL. This measure
came into effect from July 24, 2013. The
cash reserve ratio (CRR), which banks
have to maintain on a fortnightly average
basis subject to a daily minimum
requirement of 70 per cent, was modified
to require banks to maintain a daily
minimum of 99 per cent of the
requirement.

24.
On July 15, the Reserve Bank put
in place additional measures to restore
stability to the foreign exchange market.
They included raising the MSF rate by
200 bps to 10.25 per cent, restricting the
overall access by way of repos under the
LAF to `750 billion and conducting open
market sales of government securities of
`25 billion on July 18, 2013. As a
contingency measure and in anticipation
of redemption pressures on mutual funds,

II. Domestic Outlook and Projections
Growth

normal monsoon returning agricultural

27.
In the May Policy, the Reserve
Bank projected GDP growth for 2013-14
of 5.7 per cent, conditional upon a

growth to its trend level. The outlook for
industrial activity, however, was
expected to remain subdued, and growth
5

in services and exports was expected to
stay sluggish owing to global growth not
improving significantly.

upon, the current slowdown could be
reversed, returning the economy to a
higher growth trajectory. On the basis
of the above considerations, the growth
projection for 2013-14 is revised
downwards from 5.7 per cent to 5.5 per
cent (Chart 1).

28.
Activity, both domestic and
global, has evolved in line with these
expectations. While the onset of the
monsoon and its spread have been
robust, the persisting weakness in
industrial activity has heightened the
risks to growth. Moreover, global
growth has been tepid, with some signs
of loss of momentum in the US and in
EDEs on top of the ongoing contraction
in the euro area. This has impacted world
trade with consequent adverse spillovers
on India’s exports, manufacturing and
services. Over the last one year, the
Government has taken several policy
initiatives to improve the investment
environment. As these initiatives work
through the system and are further built

Inflation
29.
In the May Policy, the Reserve
Bank indicated that during 2013-14,
WPI inflation will be range-bound
around 5.5 per cent, with some edging
down in the first half and some increase
in the second half, mainly on base
effects. During Q1 of 2013-14, the
inflation trajectory has moved largely
in line with these expectations, although
some risks to the path of inflation have
surfaced in June. The stronger than
expected monsoon has not yet softened

6

food inflation as much as it should have.
In particular, vegetable prices have been
impacted by weather-driven supply
disruptions. While the outlook for
global non-oil commodity prices
remains benign, international crude oil
prices are firming up. This is reflected
in an upward adjustment of domestic
prices of petroleum products, besides
the programmed revisions in diesel
prices. The sharp depreciation of the
rupee since mid-May is expected to pass
through in the months ahead to domestic
fuel inflation as well as to non-food
manufactured products inflation through
its import content. The timing and
magnitude of the remaining administered
price revisions are a source of uncertainty
for the inflation outlook.

global commodity prices, and on the
expectation that spatial and temporal
distribution of the monsoon during the
rest of the season will be normal, the
Reserve Bank will endeavour to
condition the evolution of inflation to a
level of 5.0 per cent by March 2014,
using all instruments at its command
(Chart 2).
31.
Admittedly, inflation during
2010-13 has been high and persistent. It
is important to emphasise that
notwithstanding this, during the 2000s
as a whole, inflation averaged around
5.4 per cent in terms of the WPI and 5.8
per cent in terms of the CPI, down from
its earlier trend rate of about 7.5 per cent
for the WPI and about 9.0 per cent for
the CPI. Given this record and the
empirical evidence on the threshold level
of inflation that is conducive for sustained

30.
Keeping in view the domestic
demand-supply balance, the outlook for

7

growth, the objective is to contain
headline WPI inflation at around 5.0 per
cent in the short-term, and 3.0 per cent
over the medium-term, consistent with
India’s broader integration into the
global economy.

effect’) and July 26, consequent on
sudden stop and reversal of capital
flows in reaction to the prospective
change in the US monetary policy
stance. It is not clear if financial
markets have factored in the full
impact of the prospective tapering
of QE or whether they will react to
every future announcement of
tapering. India, with its large CAD
and dependence on external flows
for financing it, will remain
vulnerable to the confidence and
sentiment in the global financial
markets.

Monetary Aggregates
32.
With nominal growth remaining
broadly at the same level as envisaged
in the May Policy, monetary aggregates
are expected to move along the projected
trajectories. Accordingly, M3 growth
projection for 2013-14 has been retained
at 13.0 per cent and aggregate deposit
growth at 14.0 per cent. Non-food
credit of SCBs is projected to grow at
15.0 per cent. As always, these numbers
are indicative projections and not
targets.

ii.

Risk Factors
33.
The macroeconomic outlook for
2013-14 is subject to a number of risks
as indicated below.
i.

By far, the biggest risk to the
macroeconomic outlook stems from
the external sector. Financial
markets around the world went into
a flash turmoil on the perception of
an earlier than expected tapering of
QE by the US Fed. The rupee
depreciated in nominal terms by as
much as 5.8 per cent between May
22 (the day of the first ‘announcement
8

The large CAD, well above the
sustainable level of 2.5 per cent
of GDP for three years in a row, is
a formidable structural risk factor.
It has brought the external payments
situation under increased stress,
reflecting rising external
indebtedness and the attendant
burden of servicing of external
liabilities. Most external
vulnerability indicators have
deteriorated, eroding the economy’s
resilience to shocks. The recent
measures by the Reserve Bank to
restore stability to the foreign
exchange market should be used as
a window of opportunity to put in
place policies to bring the CAD
down to sustainable le vels.
Furthermore, the growing
vulnerability in the external sector
reinforces the importance of

credible fiscal consolidation with
accent on both quantity and quality
of adjustment.

to sustain growth in the mediumterm. To engender this benign
growth-inflation environment, it is
critical to ease the supply constraints
in the economy, particularly in the
food and infrastructure sectors.
Without policy efforts to address
the deterioration in productivity
and competitiveness, the pressures
from wage increases and
upward revisions in administered
prices could weaken growth even
further and exacerbate inflation
pressures.

iii. The investment climate remains
weak and risk aversion continues to
stall investment plans. The outlook
for investment is inhibited by cost
and time overruns, high leverage,
deteriorating cash flows, erosion of
asset quality and muted credit
confidence.
iv. An environment of low and stable
inflation and well-anchored
inflation expectations is necessary

III. The Policy Stance
34.
Through 2012-13, the Reserve
Bank persevered with efforts to address
growth risks with a 100 bps reduction
in the repo rate, supported by policies
to ease credit and liquidity conditions
through a 75 bps reduction in the CRR,
100 bps reduction in the SLR and OMO
purchases of the order of `1.5 trillion.

risks on account of the CAD could
warrant a swift reversal of the policy
stance. In its Mid-Quarter Review of
June, the Reserve Bank paused its
policy easing. This policy stance was
informed by the need to await a durable
receding of inflation and to be prepared
for the impact of growing uncertainty
in global financial conditions.

35.
In May this year, the Reserve
Bank continued with its easing stance
with a reduction in the policy repo rate
by a further 25 bps to support growth in
the face of gradual moderation of
headline inflation. With upside risks to
inflation still significant in the near
term, however, the Reserve Bank
indicated that it saw little space for
further policy easing and warned that

36.
Keeping in view global and
domestic macroeconomic conditions,
outlook and risks, the policy stance in
this review is guided by the need for
continuous vigil and preparedness to
pro-actively respond to risks to the
economy from external developments,
especially those stemming from global
financial markets, while managing the
9

trade-off posed by increased downside
risks to growth and continuing risks to
inflation and inflation expectations.
37.
Against this backdrop, the stance
of monetary policy is intended to:
•

address the risks to macroeconomic
stability from external shocks;

•

continue to address the heightened
risks to growth;

•

guard against re-emergence of
inflation pressures; and

•

manage liquidity conditions to
ensure adequate credit flow to the
productive sectors of the economy.

IV. Monetary Measures
Cash Reserve Ratio

38.
On the basis of the current
assessment and in line with the policy
stance outlined in Section III, the
Reserve Bank announces the following
policy measures.

43.
The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of
scheduled banks has been retained at 4.0
per cent of their net demand and time
liabilities (NDTL).

Repo Rate

Guidance

39.
It has been decided to keep the
repo rate under the liquidity adjustment
facility (LAF) unchanged at 7.25
per cent.

44.
The monetary policy stance over
the last two years has predominantly
been shaped by the growth-inflation
dynamic even as external sector concerns
have had a growing influence on policy
calibration over the last one year. The
current situation – moderating wholesale
price inflation, prospects of softening of
food inflation consequent on a robust
monsoon and decelerating growth –
would have provided a reasonable case
for continuing on the easing stance.
However, India is currently caught in a
classic ‘impossible trinity’ trilemma
whereby we are having to forfeit some
monetary policy discretion to address
external sector concerns. The recent
liquidity tightening measures by the

Reverse Repo Rate
40.
The reverse repo rate under the
LAF, determined with a spread of 100
basis points below the repo rate, stands
at 6.25 per cent.
Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)
Rate
41.
The MSF rate remains unchanged
at 300 basis points above the repo rate at
10.25 per cent.
Bank Rate
42.
The Bank Rate stands at
10.25 per cent.

Reserve Bank are aimed at checking
undue volatility in the foreign exchange
market and will be rolled back in a
calibrated manner as stability is restored
to the foreign exchange market, enabling
monetary policy to revert to supporting
growth with continuing vigil on inflation.  
It should be emphasised that the time
available now should be used with
alacrity to institute structural measures
to bring the CAD down to sustainable
levels. The Reserve Bank stands ready
to use all available instruments and
measures at its command to respond
