Statement by Dr.Y.Venugopal Reddy,
Governor, Reserve Bank of India on the
First Quarter Review of Annual Monetary Policy
for the Year 2006-07
This Review consists of three sections: I. Assessment of
Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments; II. Stance of
Monetary Policy; and III. Monetary Measures. An analytical review
of macroeconomic and monetary developments was issued a
day in advance as a supplement to this Review, providing the
necessary information and technical analysis with the help of
charts and tables.

I. Assessment of Macroeconomic and
Monetary Developments
Domestic Developments
2.
Real GDP growth during January-March 2006 is placed at
9.3 per cent as against 8.6 per cent in the corresponding quarter
a year ago. Accordingly, the Central Statistical Organisation
(CSO) in its end-May 2006 release, revised the estimates of real
GDP growth for 2005-06 to 8.4 per cent - up from the advance
estimates of 8.1 per cent released in February 2006. Real GDP
originating in agriculture, industry and services sectors rose in
the revised estimates by 3.9 per cent, 7.6 per cent and 10.3
per cent, respectively, during 2005-06 as against 0.7 per cent,
7.4 per cent and 10.2 per cent in 2004-05.
3.
While the onset of the south-west monsoon occurred nearly
a week in advance, its progress stalled in the subsequent fortnight
which resulted in delay in sowing in some parts of the country.
The revival of monsoon activity from the last week of June and
1

its spread across various parts of the country should, however,
mitigate the impact of these early adversities on the kharif output.
Of the normal area of 101.1 million hectares under kharif crops,
27.2 million hectares were covered by sowing by July 10, up
from 24.3 million hectares in the corresponding period of the
preceding year. Significant increases in sown area have been
recorded under rice (13.7 per cent), pulses (32.4 per cent),
cotton (29.6 per cent), coarse cereals (7.7 per cent) and
sugarcane (4.1 per cent). There has been a moderate rise
so far in the area sown under oilseeds. Soil moisture conditions
have improved in regions covered by these crops. During the
season so far (June 1 to July 19), rainfall has been excess/
normal in 24 of the 36 meteorological subdivisions and
86 per cent of the long-period average (LPA). The India
Meteorological Department (IMD) has updated its initial forecast
and has placed the rainfall for the south-west monsoon season
at 92 per cent of the LPA for the country as a whole.
4.
Led by manufacturing which returned to double-digit growth
in April-May, 2006 (10.9 per cent) after a gap of five months and
supported by mining (3.2 per cent) and electricity (5.3 per cent),
the index of industrial production (IIP) rose by 9.8 per cent, the
highest increase since July 2005 and up from 9.5 per cent in
April-May, 2005. Within manufacturing, growth was driven by
basic metals, machinery and transport equipment, with some
slowdown in textiles. In terms of the use-based classification,
the key feature in April-May 2006 was the growth of 21.1
per cent in capital goods (13.9 per cent a year ago), reflecting
the strength of investment activity. The production of basic goods
rose by 9.0 per cent (7.5 per cent) and intermediate goods by
7.6 per cent (3.4 per cent) drawing from the underlying buoyancy
in industrial activity. On the other hand, there was some
2

deceleration in the growth of consumer goods to 9.0 per cent
(15.9 per cent), mainly on account of consumer non-durables.
The six infrastructure industries, comprising nearly 27 per cent
of the IIP, posted a growth of 5.9 per cent during April-May,
2006 as against 7.1 per cent a year ago. Improvement in
performance was recorded in petroleum products, whereas the
growth of coal production, cement, finished steel and electricity
decelerated and crude petroleum production registered a decline.
5.
The performance of the private corporate sector has been
moderating through 2005-06 from a high growth phase in the
preceding three years. A deceleration in sales growth, higher
input costs, increase in borrowings, especially from banks, and
the consequent increase in interest payments imposed pressures
on margins, leading to a distinct slowdown in profit growth from
51.2 per cent in 2004-05 to 24.1 per cent in 2005-06. Early
results for the first quarter of 2006-07, however, indicate that
both sales growth and profits after tax improved vis-à-vis the
trends in 2005-06.
6.
The Reserve Bank’s Industrial Outlook Survey indicates
sustained business confidence in April-June, 2006 in relation to
the previous quarter and also its level a year ago. Companies
reported improvement in the overall financial situation as
availability of finance kept pace with the increasing working capital
and other requirements. Performance indicators for order books,
output, employment, capacity utilisation, exports and imports
are expected to be above their levels in the preceding quarter.
Over four-fifths of the respondents reported raw material and
finished goods inventories to be around the average level and a
majority indicated increase in raw material prices. Expectations
regarding the overall business situation and other major indicators
3

for July-September, 2006 are significantly higher than for
April-June, 2006. Business expectation surveys conducted by
most other agencies also indicate an optimistic outlook in terms
of overall economic conditions and investment climate, though
there are indications of some tempering of such optimism in one
survey. Seasonally adjusted purchasing managers’ indices signal
an ongoing improvement in operating conditions in June, driven
by output and new orders growth, including for exports.
7.
Lead indicators of services sector activity suggest that the
robust growth recorded in 2005-06 has been sustained in the
initial months of 2006-07. Railway revenue earnings from freight
traffic increased year-on-year by 11.0 per cent in April 2006,
while total cell phone connections and net addition in switching
capacity in the telecom sector jumped by 167.0 per cent and
572.1 per cent, respectively. The import and export cargo handled
by the civil aviation sector posted growth rates of 19.9 per cent
and 10.1 per cent, respectively. Foreign tourist arrivals in
April-May 2006 rose by 20.0 per cent over the corresponding
period last year. The passengers handled at international and
domestic terminals also registered growth of 16.2 per cent and
54.0 per cent, respectively, in April 2006.
8.
Banking sector activity is closely reflecting the impulses
from the real economy. In the interpretation of movements in
banking aggregates, however, a caveat is in order. The Annual
Policy Statement of April 2006 had indicated that March 31,
2006 being the last reporting Friday of 2005-06 lent an upward
bias to data for that year (since 2005-06 covered 27 fortnights of
reported data instead of the usual 26 fortnights). Per contra, the
same phenomenon has imposed a downward bias on data for
2006-07. Illustratively, variations in banking aggregates up to
4

July 7, 2006 are measured from March 31, 2006 i.e., seven
reporting fortnights. Conventionally, they would have been
compared with corresponding variations in 2005-06 which are
measured from March 18, 2005 – the last reporting Friday for
that year – i.e., covering eight reporting fortnights. On the other
hand, if similar comparisons are made, i.e., variations in the
corresponding period of 2005-06 are measured from April 1,
2005 so as to cover seven reporting fortnights, the co-movement
between banking and real sector activity becomes clearer. All
comparison of such aggregates is made on this basis in this
Statement.
9.
On this basis, non-food credit of scheduled commercial
banks (SCBs) increased by Rs.37,749 crore (2.6 per cent) up to
July 7, 2006 as compared with an increase of Rs.19,948 crore
(1.8 per cent) in the corresponding period a year ago. This
increase is contra-seasonal and is the highest first quarter
expansion in the past five years. In view of the March 31, 2006
phenomenon, year-on-year changes in monetary, credit and other
banking aggregates are more appropriate for analytical purposes
than financial year variations. On a year-on-year basis, the
increase in non-food bank credit was 32.9 per cent (Rs.3,71,993
crore) on top of an increase of 31.0 per cent (Rs.2,60,164 crore),
net of conversion of a non-bank into a bank, a year ago.
Provisional information available for April and May, 2006 indicates
that within the services sector, which currently absorbs about
50 per cent of non-food bank credit, retail lending rose by 74
per cent on a year-on-year basis with growth in housing loans
being 115.5 per cent. Loans to commercial real estate rose by
101.3 per cent. The year-on-year growth in credit to industry
was of the order of 26.0 per cent by May 2006. Substantial
increases were observed in credit flow to industries like
5

infrastructure (34.7 per cent), metals (37.6 per cent), vehicles
(37.9 per cent), gems and jewellery (43.5 per cent) and
construction (52.6 per cent). The growth in bank credit to
agriculture was of the order of 35 per cent in May 2006 on a
year-on-year basis.
10. Commercial banks’ investments in shares, bonds/
debentures and commercial paper (CP) increased by
Rs.1,075 crore (1.3 per cent) during 2006-07 so far, as against
a decline of Rs.2,683 crore (-2.9 per cent) in the corresponding
period of 2005-06. By contrast, on a year-on-year basis, there
was a decline in such investments by banks of the order of
Rs.9,508 crore (-10.5 per cent) in contrast to an increase of
Rs.4,066 crore (4.7 per cent) a year ago. Banks appear to be
undertaking portfolio shifts away from investments in order to
accommodate the sustained demand for credit. Accordingly, the
year-on-year growth in total flow of resources from SCBs to the
commercial sector was 29.6 per cent (Rs.3,62,485 crore) over
and above 27.7 per cent (Rs.2,57,062 crore), net of conversion,
a year ago.
11. Aggregate deposits of SCBs increased by Rs.68,499 crore
(3.2 per cent) up to July 7, 2006 as against an increase of
Rs.19,435 crore (1.1 per cent) in the corresponding period of
the previous year. The accretion to bank deposits during
2006-07 so far is the highest for any comparable period since
1993-94 (excluding the impact of conversion of non-banks into
banks). The year-on-year increase in aggregate deposits at
20.7 per cent (Rs.3,72,977 crore) was significantly higher than
14.9 per cent (Rs.2,34,020 crore), net of conversion, a year
ago. With the year-on-year growth in credit still outpacing deposit
growth, the incremental non-food credit-deposit ratio continued
6

to remain high at 99.7 per cent as compared with 111.2
per cent, net of conversion, a year ago.
12. Investments in Government and other approved securities
by SCBs increased by Rs.49,697 crore during the current year
so far (up to July 7, 2006) as against a decline of Rs.1,133 crore
in the corresponding period of 2005-06. These investments mainly
reflect large magnitudes of reverse repos with the Reserve Bank
and the consequent acquisition of Government securities.
Exclusive of liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) operations,
however, banks’ investments in Government and other approved
securities declined by Rs.1,328 crore during 2006-07 up to July 7,
as compared with an increase of Rs.12,397 crore a year ago.
The subdued appetite of banks for investments in general and a
preference for funding advances by shedding incremental gilt
holdings was reflected in commercial banks’ holdings of
Government and other approved securities declining from 36.4
per cent of the banking system’s net demand and time liabilities
(NDTL) on July 8, 2005 to 31.5 per cent as on July 7, 2006.
Such investments remain at Rs.1,57,548 crore above the statutory
requirement. Excluding LAF holdings, however, investments of
banks in approved securities in excess of the prescribed statutory
liquidity ratio (SLR) amounted to Rs.99,273 crore or 4.1 per cent
of the system’s NDTL. This is indicative of the limits to which
SLR disinvestment can potentially fund credit demand.
13. On a year-on-year basis, money supply (M3) growth at
18.8 per cent by July 7, 2006 was higher than 13.8 per cent, net
of conversion, a year ago and above the projected trajectory of
15.0 per cent indicated in the Annual Policy Statement for
2006-07. On a financial year basis, M3 increased by Rs.91,114
crore (3.3 per cent) during 2006-07 up to July 7, 2006 as
7

compared with the increase of Rs.40,730 crore (1.7 per cent) in
the corresponding period of the previous year.
14. On a year-on-year basis, the expansion in reserve money
as on July 14 was of the order of 16.0 per cent, lower than
18.0 per cent a year ago. On a financial year basis (July 14 over
March 31, 2006), reserve money increased by Rs.15,165 crore
(2.6 per cent) up to July 14, 2006 as compared with the increase
of Rs.17,806 crore (3.6 per cent) in the corresponding period of
the previous year. As regards the components of reserve money,
currency in circulation increased by Rs.23,646 crore
(5.5 per cent) as compared with Rs.19,536 crore (5.3 per cent).
Among the sources of reserve money, foreign currency assets
of the Reserve Bank increased by Rs.75,663 crore as against a
decline of Rs.20,630 crore in the corresponding period last year.
Net Reserve Bank credit to the Central Government declined
by Rs.1,736 crore as against an increase of Rs.25,530 crore.
15. The movements in reserve money during 2006-07 so far
reflect the significant turnaround in liquidity conditions that has
occurred between the last quarter of 2005-06 and the current
financial year so far. The overhang of liquidity in the system, as
reflected in the LAF, the market stabilisation scheme (MSS)
and the Central Government’s cash balances with the Reserve
Bank which, put together, averaged Rs.65,174 crore during
January-March, 2006 increased to Rs.92,664 crore in April 2006
and settled at Rs.85,287 crore and Rs.86,730 crore in May and
June 2006, respectively. On a review of the liquidity conditions,
the Reserve Bank resumed auctions under the MSS with effect
from May 3, 2006 in accordance with the annual ceiling for
2006-07 fixed at Rs.70,000 crore. It may be mentioned that the
Reserve Bank had refrained from fresh auctions under the MSS
8

since the second half of November 2005. The Reserve Bank
absorbed an average daily amount of Rs.46,088 crore during
April, Rs.59,505 crore in May, Rs.48,611 crore in June and
Rs.50,162 crore in July (up to July 20) under the LAF. The
liquidity overhang in the system was placed at Rs.91,231 crore
as on July 20, 2006.
16. Inflation, measured by variations in the wholesale price
index (WPI) on a year-on-year basis, rose from 4.1 per cent at
end-March 2006 to 4.7 per cent as on July 8, 2006. Prices
of primary articles, manufactured products and ‘fuel, power,
light and lubricants’ registered increases of 4.7 per cent,
3.6 per cent and 7.3 per cent, respectively, as against
2.3 per cent, 3.0 per cent and 10.5 per cent a year ago.
Inflationary pressures are mainly reflecting the pass-through of
the hike in administered prices of petrol and diesel effected on
June 6, 2006 and increases in prices of food items, including
the seasonal spike in prices of fruits and vegetables.
17. The increase of 4.2 per cent in prices of food articles
accounted for nearly 14 per cent of the year-on-year headline
inflation. The main drivers of inflation in the food articles segment
were milk, pulses and wheat. A number of measures have been
recently undertaken with a view to heading off these supply side
pressures on inflation. Import duty on wheat was reduced from
50 per cent to 5 per cent to moderate the landed import costs.
In June, private entities were allowed to import wheat, pulses
and sugar under easier terms to contain inflation. Furthermore,
a general ban has been applied on the export of refined sugar
and pulses until the end of March 2007. During 2005-06, total
stock of foodgrains with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and
other Government agencies declined by 1.4 million tonnes.
9

As on May 1, 2006 total foodgrains stock at around 22.8 million
tonnes was above the buffer stock norm of 16.2 million tonnes.
Procurement of wheat during 2006-07 at 9.2 million tonnes up
to July 11, 2006 was lower by 37.6 per cent than in the
corresponding period last year.
18. The average international price of the Indian crude basket
increased from US $ 60.1 per barrel in January-March, 2006
to US $ 67.3 per barrel in April-June, 2006 and further to
US $ 71.4 per barrel in July 2006 (up to July 21). Excluding
mineral oils, however, the WPI inflation works out to 3.0
per cent on July 8, 2006. Fuel prices, which account for about
35 per cent of the increase in WPI, constitute a major risk to
headline inflation. Domestic prices of petrol and diesel (average
of four metros) were increased by nearly 9.0 per cent and
6.5 per cent, respectively, in early June; however, international
crude oil prices continue to be volatile and rising.
19. On an annual average basis, WPI inflation was 4.3
per cent as against 6.3 per cent a year ago. During 2006-07
so far, there has been a reversal of the phenomenon of consumer
prices lagging wholesale prices, indicative of the sharp increase
in food prices which constitute a relatively larger share in the
consumer price basket. On a year-on-year basis, inflation based
on the consumer price index (CPI) for agricultural labourers and
rural labourers increased to 7.2 per cent each in June 2006
from 2.7 per cent each a year ago. The year-on-year CPI inflation
for industrial workers and urban non-manual employees was
placed at 6.3 per cent and 5.8 per cent in May 2006 as against
3.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively, a year ago.
20. Revenue receipts of the Union Government improved from
3.4 per cent as a proportion to the budget estimates (BE) in
10

April-May, 2005 to 4.8 per cent of the BE in April-May, 2006
reflecting both higher tax and non-tax revenue receipts. Total
expenditure at 16.3 per cent of the BE was higher than 11.6
per cent of the BE in April-May, 2005. There was a substantial
increase in Plan expenditures on account of front-loading of
transfers to the public account under the Central Road Fund
(CRF) and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Fund
(NREGF). There was also a sharp rise in non-Plan revenue
expenditure under grants to States, economic services and
subsidies and, in particular, interest payments. Accordingly, as
a proportion to the BE, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) and revenue
deficit increased to 48.5 per cent and 81.0 per cent, respectively,
during April-May, 2006 as compared with 31.5 per cent and
46.3 per cent in the corresponding period last year.
21. Gross market borrowings of the Central Government at
Rs.69,533 crore (Rs.60,282 crore a year ago) during 2006-07
so far (up to July 17, 2006) constituted 38.2 per cent of the BE
while net market borrowings at Rs.34,572 crore (Rs.39,234 crore
a year ago) constituted 30.4 per cent of the BE. The weighted
average yield and weighted average maturity of Central
Government securities issued during 2006-07 so far were 7.86
per cent and 14.95 years, as compared with 7.34 per cent and
16.90 years, respectively, for those issued during 2005-06.
22. Reflecting the easy conditions at the short end of the
market spectrum, interest rates in the call, market repo and
collateralised borrowing and lending obligations (CBLO) segments
of the money market eased to an average of 5.81 per cent,
5.64 per cent and 5.56 per cent, respectively, in July (up to
July 21, 2006) from 6.58 per cent, 6.17 per cent and 6.19
per cent in March 2006.
11

23. The primary yields on 91-day Treasury Bills increased to
6.44 per cent on July 21, 2006 from 6.11 per cent at end-March,
2006. Yields on 364-day Treasury Bills recorded a sharper rise
from 6.42 per cent at end-March, 2006 to 7.02 per cent in
July 2006. Activity in the CP market picked up with an increase
in the outstanding amount by 53.2 per cent to Rs.19,490 crore
by end-June, 2006 from Rs.12,718 crore at end-March, 2006.
The weighted average discount rate on CP declined from 8.59
per cent to 7.10 per cent over this period. In the market for
certificates of deposit (CDs), the weighted average discount rate
declined from 8.62 per cent at the end of March 2006 to 7.19
per cent by end-June, accompanied by an increase of 29.4 per
cent in the outstanding amount (i.e., from Rs.43,568 crore to
Rs.56,390 crore).
24. Gilt prices declined in the secondary market for government
securities. The yield on government securities with one-year
residual maturity moved up from 6.52 per cent at end-March,
2006 to 6.95 per cent as on July 21, 2006. The yield on
Government securities with 10-year residual maturity also firmed
up from 7.52 per cent at end-March 2006 to 8.27 per cent as on
July 21, 2006. The yield on Government securities with 20-year
residual maturity rose from 7.72 per cent to 8.69 per cent during
the same period. Consequently, the yield spread between
10-year and one-year Government securities widened from
100 basis points to 132 basis points as on July 21, 2006. The
yield spread between 20-year and one-year Government
securities widened from 120 basis points to 174 basis points
during the same period. Secondary market yields have generally
hardened since June 2006 with the 10-year yield increasing
sharply from 7.67 per cent on June 8 to 8.24 per cent on July
21, 2006. The underlying factors in this regard could be unsettled
12

inflation expectations in the wake of soaring international crude
prices feeding into interest rate uncertainty; sustained credit
growth and competing demand for funds between public and
private sectors; some spillover from global markets; and
apprehensions of additional pressures on market resources from
perceptions of possible higher borrowings by the Centre in the
second half of the year coupled with announcement of issuances
of bonds to oil companies.
25. Banks increased their deposit rates by about 25-100 basis
points across various maturities between March 2006 and July
2006. A majority of PSBs adjusted their deposit rates up to
three year maturity upwards by 25 to 50 basis points, while
keeping the range of 6.00-7.25 per cent unchanged for deposits
of over three years over the same period. The adjustments in
deposit rates made by some private sector and foreign banks
were somewhat higher, up to 100 basis points, particularly for
deposit rates of over one year maturity. The benchmark prime
lending rates (BPLRs) of PSBs and private sector banks moved
to a range of 10.75-11.50 per cent and 11.00-14.50 per cent
from 10.25-11.25 per cent and 11.00-14.00 per cent, respectively,
in the same period. The range of BPLRs for foreign banks
remained unchanged at 10.00-14.50 per cent during the period.
26. In the foreign exchange market, some indications of
pressure from mid-May, 2006 due to the sharp decline in stock
indices and currencies worldwide were observed. Market
sentiment corrected by June and orderly conditions have
prevailed thereafter. In contrast to the movements in the spot
segment, the forward rates appreciated after April 2006. The
average six-month forward premia eased from around
1.3 per cent to about 1.0 per cent during May-July, 2006. Market
activity as measured by the overall daily turnover in various
foreign exchange market segments increased from about
US $ 27 billion in April 3, 2006 to around US $ 36 billion by
May 15, 2006 before moderating to about US $ 26 billion by
June 30, 2006.
13

27. The equity markets witnessed significant swings during
the first quarter of 2006-07. The BSE Sensex (1978-79=100)
increased from 11,280 at end-March 2006 to reach the all-time
high of 12,612 on May 10, 2006 and a decline set in during the
second half of May. The Sensex reached a trough of 8,929 on
June 14, 2006 but firmed up thereafter to reach 10,086 on
July 21, 2006.
Developments in the External Sector
28. Balance of payments data for 2005-06 released at
end-June 2006 continue to indicate strength and resilience in
the external sector. Merchandise exports maintained a high
growth trajectory, rising by 27.5 per cent during the year. Exports
of manufactures and, in particular, transport equipments,
machinery and instruments, woollen yarn, fabrics and readymade
garments, basic chemicals and pharmaceuticals and petroleum
products underpinned the momentum of overall export growth.
Merchandise import payments also rose sharply by 31.6 per
cent, largely reflecting a growth of 47.3 per cent in petroleum, oil
and lubricants (POL) imports on the back of a rise in the average
price of the Indian basket of international crude by 42.4 per cent
from US $ 38.9 per barrel in 2004-05 to US $ 55.4 per barrel in
2005-06. Non-oil import payments increased by 20.5 per cent
with capital goods as key components, signifying the underlying
strength of domestic industrial activity. Accordingly, on a
payments basis, the merchandise trade deficit widened to
US $ 51.6 billion (6.5 per cent of GDP) from US $ 36.6 billion
(5.3 per cent) in the previous year.
29. During 2005-06, gross invisible receipts increased by 27.3
per cent, apace with merchandise exports. At US $ 91.5 billion,
invisible receipts amounted to about 87 per cent of merchandise
14

exports. The major components driving this expansion were
software exports, remittances from Indians working overseas
and a host of professional and business services. During
2005-06, invisible payments increased by 24.4 per cent, mainly
on account of higher interest payments and imports of
transportation, business and technology-related services.
Nevertheless, the net invisible surplus rose to US $ 40.9 billion
in 2005-06 from US $ 31.2 billion in the previous year.
Accordingly, the current account deficit (CAD) amounted to
US $ 10.6 billion during 2005-06 or 1.3 per cent of GDP, up
from US $ 5.4 billion or 0.8 per cent of GDP in 2004-05.
30. In the capital account, net inflows under foreign direct
investment (FDI), portfolio investment and non-resident Indian
(NRI) deposits recorded increases in 2005-06 while other capital
flows including external assistance and external commercial
borrowings moderated in relation to their levels in the preceding
year. Net FDI inflows to India picked up to US $ 5.7 billion in
2005-06 from US $ 3.2 billion in 2004-05 on sustained interest
in India as an attractive investment destination, strong
macroeconomic performance and corporate profitability.
FDI inflows were mainly channelled into manufacturing, business
and computer services. Net inflows under portfolio investment
remained buoyant at US $ 12.5 billion in 2005-06, up from
US $ 8.9 billion in 2004-05, extending an expansionary phase
that began two years ago. American Depository Receipts/Global
Depository Receipts (ADRs/GDRs) issuances also remained
buoyant as corporates took advantage of external market
conditions to issue equities abroad. NRI deposits showed a
significant turnaround from net outflows of US $ 1.0 billion in the
previous year to net inflows of US $ 2.8 billion in 2005-06. There
was a one-off principal repayment of India Millennium Deposits
15

(IMD) (US $ 5.5 billion) in the capital account and interest
payments (US $ 1.6 billion) under the current account.
31. Reflecting the movements in current and capital accounts
of the balance of payments, the accretion to foreign exchange
reserves (excluding valuation) amounted to US $ 15.1 billion
during 2005-06 on top of US $ 26.2 billion in 2004-05. At the
end of March 2006, the foreign exchange reserves stood at
US $ 151.6 billion.
32. India’s external debt increased marginally by US $ 2.0
billion during 2005-06 to US $ 125.2 billion at end-March, 2006.
Among the various components of debt, NRI deposits, trade
credit and multilateral debt registered increases which were
moderated by the redemption of IMD in December 2005. The
US dollar had a dominant share of 45.1 per cent in India’s
external debt by currency whereas rupee-denominated debt had
a share of 19.9 per cent in the external debt at end-March, 2006.
The ratio of short-term debt to total debt increased marginally to
7.0 per cent at end-March, 2006 from 6.1 per cent a year ago.
33. According to the Directorate General of Commercial
Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S), export growth in US dollar
terms moderated to 16.9 per cent during April-June, 2006 from
35.4 per cent a year ago. Merchandise import also decelerated
to 17.7 per cent from 45.4 per cent. While POL import growth
rose sharply to 39.0 per cent from 31.0 per cent reflecting the
steep rise in international crude oil prices, non-oil imports posted
a relatively modest growth of 9.6 per cent as compared with
51.7 per cent a year ago. Accordingly, the trade deficit at
US $ 12.6 billion during April-June, 2006 was higher than that of
US $ 10.5 billion in the corresponding period last year. Net
invisible earnings and capital flows have remained reasonably
16

strong despite outflows by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in
May-June. Accordingly, India’s foreign exchange reserves
increased by US $ 11.0 billion over their end-March, 2006 level
to US $ 162.7 billion as on July 14, 2006.
34. The exchange rate of the rupee depreciated by
4.7 per cent against the US dollar, by 8.4 per cent against euro,
by 10.2 per cent against pound sterling and by 5.1 per cent
against Japanese yen during 2006-07 so far (up to July 21,
2006). Orderly conditions have prevailed in the domestic foreign
exchange market during the period.
35. The exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided
by the broad principles of careful monitoring and management
of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or a
pre-announced target or a band, coupled with the ability to
intervene if and when necessary. The overall approach to the
management of India’s foreign exchange reserves takes into
account the changing composition of the balance of payments
and endeavours to reflect the ‘liquidity risks’ associated with
different types of flows and other requirements.
Developments in the Global Economy
36. Global expansion appears to be proceeding at a strong
pace in 2006 and is getting diffused across the main economic
regions. According to the World Economic Outlook of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) released in April 2006, global
growth is expected to pick up from 4.8 per cent in 2005 to
4.9 per cent in 2006 before easing to 4.7 per cent in 2007.
37. Global growth accelerated in the first half of 2006. In the
US, real GDP increased by 5.6 per cent in the first quarter, led
17

by personal consumption expenditure, exports and federal
government spending. The US economy is expected to grow at
3.4 per cent in 2006 and remains the main engine of global
growth. In the euro area, a recovery is underway with first quarter
real GDP growth at 1.9 per cent and projected to rise to
2.0 per cent in 2006. In Japan, the recovery is gathering
momentum, and there are encouraging signs that the economy
has emerged from the debt-deflation spiral of the past decade.
In China (11.3 per cent in the second quarter), Hong Kong
(8.2 per cent in the first half) and India (9.3 per cent in the first
quarter), the rapid pace of growth appears to have picked up
further. In Russia and Latin America, too, growth has been
buoyant.
38. Substantial increases have occurred in a wide range of
commodity prices. While prices of oil and metals continue to be
the main drivers, food prices have started edging up. Crude oil
prices surged since April and almost doubled over the levels
recorded in the last two years, touching a high of US $ 76.7
per barrel on July 13, 2006. The international pass-through of oil
prices to domestic retail prices has been varied across countries,
with implications for future inflation. World cereal production, in
particular, wheat and coarse grains, is expected to decrease in
2006, leading to a drawdown of stocks for the second consecutive
year. Prices of rice and wheat, in particular, are expected to
harden on strong demand growth, high input prices and low
global stocks. Non-energy prices have been increasing through
2005 and the first half of 2006. In fact, the recent turmoil in
global markets appears to have been triggered by key commodity
prices. Global metal prices rose by 48.4 per cent on an annual
basis during the first six months of 2006 on top of an increase
of 26.4 per cent in 2005. Metal price movements in recent
18

months have been characterised by a heightened degree of
volatility.
39. Consumer price inflation in the advanced economies
accelerated in the second quarter of 2006. In the US, consumer
prices rose to 4.3 per cent in June from 3.5 per cent in April,
primarily on account of energy prices. In the euro area too,
inflation rose to 2.5 per cent in May and June from 2.4 per cent
in April. Consumer prices continue to increase moderately in
Japan, i.e., by 0.6 per cent in May on account of higher oil
prices. In the UK, inflation breached the Bank of England’s target
of 2.0 per cent in April and rose to 2.5 per cent in June. In major
industrial countries, inflation appears to be on the upswing mainly
on account of oil price increases. In addition, risks loom large in
the form of lagged second order effects of oil price increases,
geopolitical tensions, the probability of disruptive adjustment of
current account imbalances and the cooling global housing
market. Inflation expectations have also been reflected in the
gap between nominal and inflation-indexed bonds which hovered
in the range of 2.2-2.7 per cent in the US in May-July.
40. Global imbalances, emanating mainly from the twin deficits
of the US and reflected in misalignment of major currencies,
have continued to widen during 2006 in an environment of rising
interest rates worldwide and prospects of contraction of liquidity
in the global financial markets. The current account deficit of the
US surpassed US $ 800 billion in 2005, matched by increased
surpluses elsewhere, particularly in Japan, Europe, China and
other parts of emerging Asia and oil-exporting countries. The
IMF projects that the U.S. current account deficit will remain at
about 6 per cent of GDP into the medium term, with some
improvement in the U.S. fiscal position offset by low private
19

savings and rising interest payments. The sharp rise in the net
foreign liability position of the US raises the risks of abrupt and
disorderly adjustment of major currencies as the global
imbalances unwind.
41. Financial markets are becoming increasingly apprehensive
about the risks of a disorderly adjustment of the widening global
imbalances. Adverse expectations of markets were recently
evident in the large declines in stock exchanges across the
globe and a visibly increased preference for debt. Long-term
sovereign bond yields, which had moved up briefly, have again
fallen well below their long-run averages and yield curves have
either flattened or inverted in major industrial economies.
Ten-year bond yields in Japan, the euro area and the US currently
stand at 1.79 per cent, 3.95 per cent and 5.05 per cent,
respectively.
42. Against the background of these global developments,
a large number of central banks have raised their official interest
rates from the unusually low levels that they had reached earlier
in the decade. They include the US Federal Reserve
(by 25 basis points each on seventeen occasions from June
2004 to 5.25 per cent by June 2006); the European Central
Bank (ECB) (three times since December 2005 by 25 basis
points each to 2.75 per cent); the Bank of Japan (uncollateralised
overnight rate to 0.25 per cent in July after maintaining a zero
interest rate policy since 2001); the Bank of Canada
(by 50 basis points in April-May, 2006 to 4.25 per cent); the
Reserve Bank of Australia (by 25 basis points in May 2006 to
5.75 per cent); the People’s Bank of China (lending rate raised
by 0.27 percentage points to 5.85 per cent on April 28, 2006;
required reserve ratio by 50 basis points on July 5 to 8.0 per cent
20

and a further increase of 50 basis points to become effective
from August 15, 2006); the Bank of Korea (by 25 basis points
to 4.25 per cent in June); and the Banco Central de
Chile (benchmark lending rate raised to 5.25 per cent on
July 13, 2006).
43. Some central banks have kept their policy rates steady as
for instance, the Bank of England (repo rate at 4.50 per cent
since August 2005); Bank Negara Malaysia (policy rate at
3.5 per cent since April 2006); the Bank of Thailand (the 14-day
repurchase rate at 5.00 per cent since June 2006); and the
Monetary Authority of Singapore.
44. A few central banks have eased monetary policy in the
recent period such as the Banco de Mexico (cut the benchmark
overnight lending rate from 7.50 per cent to 7.25 per cent in
March 2006 and further to 7.0 per cent in April 2006); Bank
Indonesia (reduced its policy rate from 12.50 per cent to
12.25 per cent on July 6, 2006); and the Banco Central do
Brasil (cut Selic rate target gradually from September 2005 to
14.75 per cent by July 2006).
Overall Assessment
45. There are several positive factors in domestic
developments during 2006-07 so far which support an optimistic
near-term outlook for the Indian economy. First, corporate
performance remains reasonably robust, despite some
deceleration. Second, investment activity is picking up in an
environment of rising capital expenditures of corporates, a surge
in capital goods production in April and May, continuing expansion
of investment intentions and strong demand for bank credit.
Third, most business confidence surveys report growth in new
21

order books, increase in capacity utilisation and improvement in
financing conditions notwithstanding some hardening of interest
rates. Fourth, even as non-food bank credit has continued to
expand at the high rates recorded over the last couple of years,
deposit growth has picked up and overall liquidity in the system
has been ample. Banks continue to hold over Rs.1,50,000 crore
of excess SLR investments which could, to some extent,
accommodate the demand for bank credit. Fifth, financial markets
have responded to these shifts in financing conditions, on the
whole, in an orderly fashion. Sixth, inflation has stabilised since
mid-June, despite increases in administered prices of petroleum
products and the spike in food prices. Price stability has created
conducive conditions for growth to continue undisrupted.
46. On the external front, export growth remains strong.
Although early indications suggest that non-oil import growth
appears to have slackened somewhat, the continuing sharp
growth of POL imports, driven by soaring international crude
prices, has resulted in a higher trade deficit. Invisible earnings
and capital flows have, however, enabled the financing of the
rising trade deficit while adding to the reserves during the year
so far.
47. Some developments in the first quarter of 2006-07 do
suggest the need to remain on guard against the emerging
risks. The changes in administered prices of petrol and diesel in
June 2006 imparted a direct effect of 45 basis points on headline
inflation. Given that catch-up of domestic POL product prices
with the possible permanent component of international prices
remains incomplete, the upside risks to inflation are evident. In
the recent period, these risks have become amplified by the
renewed hardening of international crude prices to new highs,
22

due to escalating geopolitical tensions. The recent increases in
domestic food prices occurring in an environment in which
international food prices are also hardening is a relevant factor
in this regard, though some seasonal elements in movements in
domestic prices of food items are possible. These risks to inflation
are being carefully monitored with appropriate supply-side policy
responses of the Government.
48. Non-food bank credit growth on a year-on-year basis
remains high and comparable to the elevated rates recorded
since 2004-05. The growth of monetary aggregates is also higher
on a year-on-year basis. Interest rates in various segments of
the financial markets have hardened with the exception of the
money markets which reflect contrasting conditions of excess
liquidity. Accordingly, call, market repo and CBLO rates have
eased with absorption of liquidity of about Rs 60,000 crore, and
even beyond, on a daily basis in the LAF during mid-May to
early June and again in the first week of July. By contrast, the
tightening of yields in the Government securities market needs
to be noted. These developments would warrant closer policy
attention in response to evolving circumstances. On the whole,
financial markets in India, despite the noticeable volatility in equity
markets, have exhibited resilience relative to most other emerging
market economies.
49. The Annual Policy Statement of April 2006 warned of three
key risks from global developments for emerging economies
including India: potential escalation and volatility in international
crude prices; a disorderly unwinding of the global imbalances;
and a hardening of international interest rates along with the
direction of movement in setting monetary policy. Since then,
the evolution of the global economy seems to indicate that each
23

of these risks is materialising; in fact, these risks appear to have
heightened in recent months. First, international crude prices
have risen from an average level of US $ 57 per barrel at
end-2005 to above US $ 73 per barrel currently. By all indications,
crude oil prices are expected to remain at elevated levels until
the end of 2007 with no respite in sight. Second, global
imbalances are likely to persist in 2006. Large misalignment
among major currencies is now in evidence with sharp
cross-currency movements characterising recent months. Third,
while core inflation appears contained, headline inflation has
hardened across countries in the second quarter of 2006, driven
up mainly by crude prices and some pressure from non-energy
prices. Fourth, since the announcement of the Annual Policy
Statement, monetary policy has been tightened further with
increases in key policy rates in some advanced economies such
as the US, the Euro area, Canada, Japan and Australia as well
as in some emerging economies like China, Korea and Chile,
with some of them even acting simultaneously in early June.
Market expectations seem to reflect apprehensions of further
tightening in the coming months. Fifth, along with the recent
shifts in portfolios away from the emerging markets and
commodity exchanges, financial markets are currently re-pricing
risks in an environment of uncertainty and, in particular, in
emerging market economies.
50. The prospects for growth in the world economy in 2006
are considered bright and indicators of business confidence and
unemployment in major economies lend credence to this optimism
for the near-term. However, it is widely recognised that several
features of the current global upswing are causes for concern:
large fiscal deficits, low household savings and low investment
in some large economies; unprecedented and growing current
24

account imbalances; narrowing or closing in of output gaps in
many economies; record highs in oil prices accompanied by
uncertainties about their future evolution; and the outlook for
inflation firming up.
51. In the global financial markets, the period since the Annual
Policy Statement has been characterised by significant re-pricing
of risks. The first four months of 2006 saw a continuation of the
shift by investors towards higher-risk asset classes, with marked
increase in equity, commodity and high-yield debt prices. There
were, however, some initial signs of discomfort in financial
markets in February 2006 attributed to unwinding of carry trades
and the steep fall in select equity markets. There was also some
evidence of increased uncertainty in foreign exchange markets,
globally. A clear reversal of direction in many markets came to
the fore in mid-May. The prices of highly rated government bonds
rose, while those of riskier assets fell. The mid-May correction
was felt acutely by emerging market economies – especially in
equity markets - including India. Currencies of some emerging
market economies depreciated significantly against the US dollar.
It is clear that fundamentals could not have changed in such a
dramatic fashion in a short time and, hence, it is reasonable to
suggest that those economies that had gained most from lower
pricing of risks in recent years felt the impact of reversal in
direction since mid-May the most. The two important questions
in assessing the outlook are: whether the process of re-pricing
of risks, in general, is complete; and whether corrections
are incomplete in the economies which benefited from
lower-priced risks in the past. The overall macroeconomic and
geopolitical global environment is admittedly indicative of
marked downside risks.

25

II. Stance of Monetary Policy for the
Remaining Period of 2006-07
52. The Annual Policy Statement for 2006-07 had stated that
in the context of macroeconomic developments and the global
scenario, it is necessary to be in readiness to act as warranted
to meet the challenges posed by the evolving situation, given
the unfolding of the risks. It had also indicated that the balance
of risks was tilted towards the global factors and that in a situation
of generalised tightening of monetary policy, India cannot afford
to stay out of step. While keeping in view the dominance of
domestic factors as in the past, the Annual Policy Statement
assigned more weight to global factors than before while
formulating the policy stance. The overall stance of monetary
policy for the year as a whole was expressed in terms of ensuring
a monetary and interest rate environment that enables
continuation of the growth momentum consistent with price
stability while being in readiness to act in a timely and prompt
manner on any signs of evolving circumstances impinging on
inflation expectations. A key element of the stance was the
focus on credit quality and financial market conditions to support
export and investment demand in the economy for maintaining
macroeconomic, and in particular, financial stability. Emphasis
was laid on responding swiftly to evolving global developments.
53. Since the announcement of the Annual Policy Statement
in April 2006, there was definitive evidence of widespread and
simultaneous monetary policy tightening among several countries
in early June. This had to be viewed against the backdrop of
marked and heightened volatility in the financial markets. Though
not entirely unanticipated, the virtual global coverage, nature
and timing of these developments posed a serious threat to
26

the domestic economy which, thus far, had been spared of
turbulence in the debt and foreign exchange markets. These
developments, viewed in the light of the prevailing monetary
and credit environment underscored compulsions of swift action,
as indicated in the Annual Policy Statement. Accordingly, on
June 8, 2006 the LAF reverse repo/repo rates were increased
by 25 basis points. The spread between repo and reverse repo
rate under the LAF was retained at 100 basis points.
54. In India, the prospects of sustaining the high growth
momentum of recent years appear favourable at the current
juncture with the outlook on agriculture somewhat positive and
industrial and services sector activity remaining robust in the
early months of 2006-07. Inflationary pressures have, by and
large, been contained so far by appropriate monetary policy
action and supply-side policy measures that have been put in
place to head off the cost-push effects of the recent hardening
of food prices. Business confidence continues to be healthy on
the acceleration of growth in industrial production, particularly
capital goods and exports. The economy can also be expected to
benefit from the brightened growth prospects of the global
economy. As regards the balance of payments, despite the growing
oil import bill, the anticipated current account deficit in 2006-07 is
manageable, as in the past, due to the continuing underlying
strength of merchandise exports, invisibles and capital flows.
55. There is also a need to note that within the domestic
economy, demand pressures continue to be in evidence. First,
the year-on-year money supply and credit growth indicates that
aggregate demand conditions continue to be strong. Second,
there has been a significant turnaround in the liquidity conditions
from considerable tightness in the last quarter of 2005-06 to
27

a large overhang of surplus liquidity. Third, factors like increased
prices of primary food articles and industrial raw materials are
new forces impinging on domestic inflation expectations. This is
in addition to the incomplete pass-through of global oil price
increases which is largely being regarded now as containing
a significant permanent component. Against this background,
it is critical that underlying inflationary pressures are contained
and that inflationary expectations are anchored for supporting
economic growth and financial stability.
56. The Annual Policy Statement had alluded to the liquidity
risks embedded in a system which was significantly overdrawn
in terms of credit portfolios. Banks need to recognise the reality
of business and credit cycles and the worldwide concern that
is currently surrounding their evolution. Analytical assessment
of these realities could justify counter-cyclical switches in
portfolios between loans and investments. Ensuring credit quality
remains a priority in the context of financial stability. Banks would
need to focus on mobilisation of retail deposits which have
durability, stricter credit appraisals on a sectoral basis, monitor
loan-to-value ratios and generally ensure the health of credit
portfolios on an enduring basis.
57. The outlook for the global economy presents, in some
sense, a complex combination of strong growth and heightened
uncertainties, especially the volatility in equity, and to some
extent, in currency and bond markets, particularly in emerging
economies, in addition to the concerns relating to oil prices. The
responses of monetary authorities to developments in financial
markets in the second quarter of the calendar year 2006 indicate
greater resilience among most economies, developed as well as
emerging, as financial markets re-price their risks aggressively,
28

although some nervous sentiments on the way forward are
evident. In the circumstances, the response of our monetary
policy to global developments should be pre-emptive at signs of
heightened uncertainties but should also be willing to discern
possible trends towards normalcy. Thus, monetary policy may
not be unidirectional for a prolonged period, recognising that the
pace of changes in the global economic and financial environment
is far more rapid now than ever before.
58. Some uncertainty continues to surround the progress of
the monsoon. As of now, it is reasonable to assume that real
GDP originating in agriculture would maintain its trend growth of
3.0 per cent. The overall industrial outlook continues to be positive
and services sector growth is expected to sustain its momentum.
Overall, for policy purposes, the forecast for GDP growth is
retained in the range of 7.5-8.0 per cent during 2006-07 as
projected in the Annual Policy Statement, barring domestic or
external shocks.
59. There is some evidence that while increased competition
and productivity gains in several sectors have contributed to
some moderation in inflation, commodity prices and input costs
are currently rising with producers increasingly prone to passing
on the squeeze on margins to consumers. The pass-through of
international oil price increases is expected to be higher in the
future than before and policy authorities have to be on guard
against second round effects. Taking into account the real,
monetary and global factors, containing the year-on-year inflation
rate for 2006-07 in the range of 5.0-5.5 per cent warrants
appropriate priority in policy responses.
60. For the purpose of monetary policy formulation, the
expansion in M3 was projected at around 15.0 per cent for
29

2006-07 in the Annual Policy Statement. The growth in aggregate
deposits was projected at around Rs.3,30,000 crore in 2006-07.
Non-food bank credit including investments in bonds/debentures/
shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sector
and CP was expected to increase by around 20 per cent.
Developments during the first quarter of 2006-07 indicate that
money supply, deposit and credit growth are running well above
the indicative projections, warranting caution by all concerned in
this regard.
61. Central bankers all over the world revel over the dream
run of low inflation coupled with high growth in recent years.
They are confronted with the confusing realities presented by
financial markets, oil markets and inflation uncertainties. They
face the uncertainties of the future more acutely than ever before,
since an increasingly globalised world is making assessments
as well as policy options in the domestic arena very constrained.
India is no exception to this, but a greater complexity is imparted
since structural transformation of the economy and its gradual
integration with the global economy add to the uncertainties.
Yet, the trade-offs and judgments have to be made, keeping in
view the criticality of timeliness in actions and flexibility to respond
appropriately. For our economy, the domestic considerations
continue to dominate and maintaining growth momentum is of
the highest importance, but if, contextually, priority has to be
accorded to demand management, price stability, inflation
expectations and financial stability, there should be no hesitation
to do so. The current situation calls for some stabilising influences
while keeping all the options open for the future to maintain a
successful and dynamic balance between growth and stability
that has been the hallmark of our macroeconomic policies during
the reform period.
30

62. Our current assessment points to the domestic economy
exhibiting strong fundamentals and displaying considerable
resilience. At the same time, there are disturbing signs of demand
pressures, especially continuing high credit growth, that could
exert upward pressure on prices when associated with supply
shocks such as from oil. These pressures have the potential for
impacting stability and inflation expectations. Against this
background, as usual, judgments are necessary as to the relative
weights to be accorded to growth and price stability, recognising
lags in monetary policy. While domestic developments continue
to dominate our economy, global factors tend to gain more
attention now than before. The global outlook for growth is
positive but downside risks in regard to inflation and re-pricing
of risks in financial markets need to be recognised. Hence, it is
necessary to strike a balance between reinforcing the resilience
of our economy against global risks and taking advantage of
global expansion. Both domestic and global factors are delicately
balanced in terms of growth vis-à-vis price stability with a tilt
towards the possibility of identified downside risks materialising
in the near-term being more likely than before. The unfolding
path of the identified risks, however, is naturally unclear at this
stage. On balance, a modest pre-emptive action in monetary
policy is appropriate at this juncture while being ready to respond
flexibly and promptly by closely monitoring the related
developments.
63. The Reserve Bank will continue to ensure that appropriate
liquidity is maintained in the system so that all legitimate
requirements of credit are met, particularly for productive
purposes, consistent with the objective of price and financial
stability. Towards this end, the Reserve Bank will continue with
its policy of active demand management of liquidity through
31

open market operations (OMO) including MSS, LAF and CRR,
and using all the policy instruments at its disposal flexibly, as
and when the situation warrants.
64. In sum, barring the emergence of any adverse and
unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy
and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy
including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary
policy in the period ahead will be:
•

To ensure a monetary and interest rate environment
that enables continuation of the growth momentum
while emphasising price stability with a view to
anchoring inflation expectations.

•

To reinforce the focus on credit quality and financial
market conditions to support export and investment
demand in the economy for maintaining
macroeconomic and, in particular, financial stability.

•

To consider measures as appropriate to the evolving
global and domestic circumstances impinging on
inflation expectations and the growth momentum.

32

III. Monetary Measures
(a) Bank Rate
65.

The Bank Rate has been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent.

(b) Reverse Repo Rate
66.
In view of the current macroeconomic and overall monetary
conditions, it has been decided:
•

To increase the fixed reverse repo rate under the
liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) of the Reserve Bank
by 25 basis points from 5.75 per cent to 6.00 per
cent, with immediate effect.

67.
The repo rate will continue to be linked to the reverse
repo rate. The spread between the reverse repo rate and the
repo rate has been retained at 100 basis points, as at present.
Accordingly, the fixed repo rate under the LAF will be 7.00
per cent, with immediate effect.

(c) Cash Reserve Ratio
68.
The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks is
currently at 5.0 per cent. On a review of the current liquidity
situation, it is felt desirable to keep the present level of CRR at
5.0 per cent unchanged.
Mid-term Review
69.
The Mid-term Review of the Annual Policy Statement will
be undertaken on October 31, 2006 instead of October 17, 2006
and the Third Quarter Review on January 30, 2007 instead
of January 23, 2007 as indicated in the Annual Policy Statement
of April 2006.
