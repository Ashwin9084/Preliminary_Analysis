second quarter review of monetary policy 2010-11
by
dr. d. subbarao
governor

introduction
this second quarter review is set
in the context of a mixed backdrop of
persistent sluggishness in advanced
economies and positive signals from
emerging market economies (emes).
while recovery in advanced economies
has slowed in the second half of 2010,
emes continue to show strong growth.
the fragile and uneven nature of the
recovery and large unemployment in
advanced economies raise concerns about
the sustainability of the global recovery,
which has prompted the international
monetary fund (imf) to project a lower
world gdp growth of 4.2 per cent in 2011
as compared with 4.8 per cent in 2010.
2.
the rising concerns about
the slowing momentum of recovery
have prompted the central banks of some
advanced economies to initiate
(or consider initiating) a second round of
quantitative easing to further stimulate
private demand. while the ultra loose
monetary policy of advanced economies
may benefit the global economy in the
medium-term, in the short-term it will
trigger further capital inflows into emes
and put upward pressure on global
commodity prices.

3.
on the domestic front, economic
activity is firmly in place. the 8.8 per cent
gdp growth for q1 of 2010-11 suggests
that the economy is operating close to the
trend growth rate, driven mainly by
domestic factors. the south-west
monsoon was normal which should boost
agricultural output and rural demand. most
industrial and service sector indicators
also point towards sustained growth.
4.
notwithstanding some moderation
in recent months, headline inflation
remains significantly above its
medium-term trend. what is of concern
is that while non-food manufactured
products inflation has stabilised, food
inflation has not shown the expected
post-monsoon moderation. persistently
rising food prices even in the wake of a
normal monsoon raise concerns about the
structural nature of food inflation and its
consequent impact on inflationary
expectations. further, when the economy
is growing close to trend, the risks of
structural food inflation spilling over into
prices of other commodities are
significant and that could potentially
offset the recent moderation.
5.
this statement is organised in two
parts. part a covers monetary policy and

rate policy (section ii), financial
markets (section iii), credit delivery and
financial inclusion (section iv),
regulatory and supervisory measures for
commercial banks (section v) and
institutional developments (section vi).
part a of this statement should be read and
understood together with the detailed
review in macroeconomic and monetary
developments released yesterday by the
reserve bank.

is divided into four sections: section i
provides an overview of global and
domestic macroeconomic developments;
section ii sets out the outlook and
projections for growth, inflation and
monetary aggregates; section iii explains
the stance of monetary policy; and section
iv specifies the monetary measures. part b
covers developmental and regulatory
policies and is organised in six sections:
financial stability (section i), interest

part a. monetary policy
i. the state of the economy
of the sovereign debt problems in
may-june 2010, though at an uneven pace
across the region. growth in the emes
continues to be strong, led mainly by
domestic demand but supported by exports.

global economy
6.
in its world economic outlook
released in october 2010, the imf revised
upwards its forecast for global growth for
2010 from 4.6 per cent to 4.8 per cent.
however, the estimate for the second half
of the year is significantly lower than for
the first. moreover, the growth process
remains uneven being driven largely by
emerging and developing countries. in
advanced economies, the recovery
continues to be fragile as private demand
has not picked up sufficiently to offset the
waning fiscal stimulus.

8.
inflation rates in advanced
economies remain subdued due to high
level of slack in resource utilisation and
high unemployment. in the us and japan,
inflation rates are significantly below
desired levels providing a rationale for
central banks to provide further stimulus
through quantitative easing. in sharp
contrast, emes are witnessing rising
domestic demand which is beginning to
generate inflationary pressures. these
could be aggravated by significant
increases in commodity prices driven by
investment flows into these markets.
inflation is a growing concern in several
emes.

7.
in the us, growth remained
sluggish in the third quarter of 2010.
household spending is constrained by high
unemployment, modest income growth,
lower housing wealth and tight credit. the
economic recovery in japan has also
moderated recently as reflected in
slowdown in industrial production and
growth in exports. on the other hand,
economic activity in the euro area is
showing signs of resilience in the aftermath

domestic economy
9.
india’s growth of 8.8 per cent in
q1 of 2010-11 suggests that the recovery
set in the second half of 2009-10 is
2

conditions surveys also indicate a similar
trend. while the reserve bank’s survey
on capacity utilisation indicates that there
is a small decline in utilisation at the
aggregate level, several sectors appear to
be facing capacity constraints, resulting in
increased imports.

consolidating. the normal south-west
monsoon and its delayed withdrawal have
boosted the prospects of both kharif and
rabi agricultural production.
10.
industrial growth has been robust,
although apparently with a significant
increase in volatility. the year-on-year
increase in the index of industrial
production (iip) varied in a range of
5.6 to 15.2 per cent during april–august
2010, with an average of 10.6 per cent.
industrial growth was high in the capital
goods, consumer durables and
intermediate goods sectors. while the
volatility raises concerns about a
deceleration, other indicators of economic
activity suggest continuing momentum.
exports have grown steadily during the
first half of 2010-11, showing an increase
of 27.6 per cent over the corresponding
period of last year. based on an analysis
of a sample of 2,546 non-financial
companies, private corporate sector sales
rose by 24 per cent year-on-year in q1 of
2010-11. early results of corporate
performance indicate sustained sales
growth and improved profitability in
q2 of 2010-11. direct tax collections, as
reflected in advance taxes paid in
september 2010, rose by 16.5 per cent
over last year. similarly, indirect tax
collections during the april-september
period were 43.1 per cent higher than in
the corresponding period of 2009.

12.
on the inflation front, the new
series of wholesale price index (wpi)
released on september 14, 2010 is a better
representative of commodity price levels
with an updated base (2004-05=100)
and wider coverage of commodities. while
inflation at the aggregate level
does not show much variation over the
medium-term between the old and new
series, there are significant differences in
inflation at the disaggregated level. as per
the new wpi series, the year-on-year
inflation moderated to 8.5 per cent in
august 2010 and 8.6 per cent in september
2010 after remaining in double digits
during march-july 2010. at a
disaggregated level, inflation in primary
articles, especially food articles, in the
new series has been significantly higher
than in the old series, whereas for
manufactured products, it has been
somewhat lower.
13.
during 2010-11, although the yearon-year primary food inflation moderated
from 21.4 per cent in may 2010 to 15.7
per cent in september 2010, the
moderation was not commensurate with
patterns following a normal monsoon on
previous occasions. this is partly a
reflection of the growing importance of
protein-rich items in the consumption
basket for which price increases have been
large. the year-on-year inflation rate in
protein-based food items such as pulses,

11.
the buoyancy in various service
sectors witnessed in the second half of
2009-10, has continued this year as well.
the latest quarterly industrial outlook
survey conducted by the reserve bank
indicates improvement in the overall
business conditions. other business

consumption pattern of the mid-1980s
and 2001 which have a relatively higher
weight for cereals, whereas more updated
(2004-05) wpi basket suggests that
food consumption has shifted towards
protein-rich items where price increase has
been high. to that extent, cpi baskets
understate the underlying food inflation.

milk, eggs, fish and meat (with a combined
weight of 6.4 per cent in wpi basket),
peaked at 34 per cent in may 2010 and
remained very high at 23.9 per cent in
september 2010. inflation in the other
primary food articles (weight: 8.0
per cent) moderated from 14.0 per cent in
june 2010 to 9.4 per cent in september
2010, more visibly reflecting the impact
of normal monsoon on prices of major
cereals, fruits and vegetables. in sum,
despite some moderation, overall food
price inflation remains at an elevated level.
the year-on-year inflation as of september
2010 was also high for certain primary
non-food articles such as raw rubber
(57.4 per cent), sugarcane (53.3 per cent)
and cotton (27.5 per cent). the rise in
cotton prices reflected global trends.

16.
money supply (m 3 ) growth
moderated from 16.8 per cent on a
year-on-year basis at end-march 2010 to
14.5 per cent at end-may 2010 before
increasing to 15.2 per cent by october 8,
2010. at this level, it was below the
indicative projection of 17.0 per cent for
2010-11. the lower m3 growth essentially
reflected the moderation in growth in bank
deposits, particularly long-term deposits.
furthermore, currency growth has been
higher than deposits growth which
reduced the money multiplier, thereby
lowering m3 growth. a contributory factor
to this trend has been negative real interest
rates on deposits, which have induced
depositors to both hold currency and
invest in non-financial assets, including
gold and real estate, whose prices have
shown significant increases over the
course of the current year.

14.
focusing on the manufacturing
sector, the year-on-year wpi non-food
manufactured products (weight: 55.0
per cent) inflation increased from (-) 2.0
per cent in september 2009 to a peak of
5.9 per cent in april 2010, before
moderating to 5.0 per cent in september
2010. non-food items inflation (wpi
excluding food products and food
articles), which was (-) 2.9 per cent
in september 2009, rose sharply to
9.2 per cent in april 2010 before
moderating to 7.8 per cent by september
2010. non-food items (weight: 75.7
per cent) contributed 65.5 per cent to wpi
inflation in september 2010, up from 40.5
per cent in january 2010.

17.
non-food
credit
growth
accelerated from 17.1 per cent on a
year-on-year basis at end-march 2010 to
22.3 per cent by july 2, 2010, reflecting
in part the higher credit demand emanating
from telecom spectrum auctions. although
it moderated to 20.1 per cent as of october
8, 2010, it was in line with the indicative
trajectory of 20 per cent for 2010-11 set
out in the monetary policy statement of
april 2010. even after adjusting for
spectrum auction related advances, growth

15.
inflation based on cpi for
industrial workers has moderated to single
digit since august 2010 after remaining
in double digits for 13 months. however,
the various cpi baskets still reflect the
4

average daily net injection of around
`24,000 crore in september and `61,700
crore in october 2010 and a peak injection
of `1,28,685 crore on october 30, 2010.
while the injection mode in the laf
window has been consistent with the stated
policy stance, the sharp changes have
largely been due to significant increases in
government cash balances, which stood at
`77,736 crore as on october 30, 2010.

in bank credit during the current financial
year so far has been in line with the longterm trend. disaggregated data suggest
that year-on-year credit growth to large
industries, including infrastructure
(especially power and telecom), and
housing sectors improved significantly.
the increase in bank credit to the
commercial sector was also supplemented
by the higher flow of funds from other
sources. rough estimates showed that the
total flow of financial resources from
banks, non-banks and external sources to
the commercial sector during the first half
of 2010-11 was higher at `4,85,000 crore,
up from `3,29,000 crore during the same
period of previous year.

20.
with a view to alleviating
frictional liqudity pressure, the reserve
bank on october 29, 2010 decided to
conduct second laf (slaf) and also
allowed scheduled commercial banks to
avail of additional liquidity support under
the laf to the extent of up to 1.0 per cent
of their ndtl as on october 8, 2010. in
view of the likely persistence of the
frictional liqudity pressure and in order
to provide liquidity comfort, these
measures have been extended up to
november 4, 2010.

18.
on the lending side, the base rate
system replaced the benchmark prime
lending rate (bplr) system with
effect from july 1, 2010. base rates of
scheduled commercial banks (scbs) were
fixed in the range of 5.50-9.00 per cent.
subsequently, several banks reviewed
and increased their base rates in the range
of 10–50 basis points by october 2010.
base rates of major banks, accounting for
over 94 per cent in total bank credit, are
in the range of 7.50-8.50 per cent. banks
have also raised their bplrs in the
range of 25-75 basis points for their old
loans.

21.
both the increases in lending rates
by the banking system and liquidity
conditions are consistent with the
monetary policy stance of reining in
inflation. tight liquidity conditions are
helping to strengthen the transmission
from policy rates to commercial lending
rates, and the process is becoming much
more transparent through the operation of
the base rate system. as desirable as
these conditions may be from the
viewpoint of inflation management, there
are legitimate concerns that the deficit, as
reflected by borrowings under the laf in
recent weeks, is significantly in excess of
the reserve bank’s comfort zone of
(+/-) one per cent of net demand and time
liabilities (ndtl) of banks. the high

19.
liquidity conditions, which
remained tight between end-may 2010 and
july 2010 due to huge outflow of liquidity
from the system, eased in august 2010.
after alternating between surplus and
deficit for a brief period, the liquidity
adjustment facility (laf) window of the
reserve bank has remained in an injection
mode since september 9, 2010 with an
5

level of government balances indicates
that the tight liquidity situation is likely
to ease to some extent as the government
draws down its balances in the coming
weeks.

recurring expenditure commitments
should not be made against one off
revenues such as from disinvestment and
the quality of adjustment should not be
lost sight of.

22.
on the basis of large spectrum
auction realisations, buoyant tax revenues
and in anticipation of significant inflows
from disinvestment during the current
year, the government announced that it
would pare its market borrowing by
`10,000 crore in the second half of the
financial year. further, on october 21,
2010, as a part of its cash management
operations, the government, in
consultation with the reserve bank,
announced the repurchase of government
securities amounting to ` 28,553 crore
maturing during 2010-11. the repurchase
operations would be funded through the
surplus cash balances of the government.
in the first tranche, repurchase of
securities for an aggregate amount of
` 12,000 crore was notified and ` 2,148
crore was accepted in the auction held on
october 26, 2010.

24.
the combination of liquidity
conditions and revised government
borrowing estimates have had contrasting
impacts on the yield curve. at the short
end, as the laf window operated in
deficit mode, the overnight interest rates
were generally close to the ceiling of the
laf rate corridor during septemberoctober 2010, even exceeding it on
occasions in response to sudden surges
in demand. however, at the long end, the
announced reduction in net borrowing of
the central government had a downward
impact on government bond yields, as the
10-year benchmark government security
yield fell to about 7.92 per cent in
early october 2010 from a high of 8.07
per cent in august. yields have risen
again recently, reaching a high of 8.14
per cent on october 20, 2010, reflecting
the tightening of liquidity conditions.

23.
the increase in the overall revenue
realisation of the government during the
current year is a welcome development. it
virtually eliminates the possibility of the
fiscal deficit overshooting the budget
estimate. fiscal consolidation is important
for a number of reasons, including the fact
that monetary policy works most
efficiently, particularly when it is dealing
with an inflationary situation, when the
fiscal situation is under control. several
things are important to make the fiscal
consolidation effort credible and effective.
the focus must be as much on expenditure
restructuring as on revenue augmentation,

25.
domestic equity prices firmed up
significantly in recent weeks due to large
inflows from foreign institutional
investors (fiis), driven by better domestic
growth prospects and a surfeit of global
liquidity. the foreign exchange market,
which witnessed a significant increase in
net inflows beginning september 2010,
has remained orderly with the rupee
showing two-way movements in the range
of `44.03 – `44.74 per us dollar during
october 2010.
26.
during 2010-11 so far (october
22, 2010), the rupee appreciated by
6

0.4 per cent on the basis of trade based
36-currency real effective exchange rate
(reer). the extent of appreciation was,
of course, higher on the basis of
6-currency trade based reer (3.1 per
cent) reflecting both the nominal
appreciation of the rupee against the us
dollar during this period and the higher
inflation differential with major advanced
countries. since the 36-currency reer
includes the currencies of many countries
which are india’s direct competitors in
the global market, it is a better reflection
of the impact of global exchange rate
movements on competitiveness. the
relatively small appreciation in this index
reflects the fact that many competing
countries have also seen their currencies
appreciate during this period. from this
perspective, the impact of the recent
nominal appreciation of the rupee may
not have a significant implication for
competitiveness.

27.
the continuing sluggishness of the
global economy led to some moderation in
exports growth and invisible receipts, while
import growth accelerated due to the strong
domestic recovery. consequently, both the
trade deficit and the current account deficit
(cad) widened in q1 of 2010-11. if the
current trend persists, cad as a percentage
of gdp will be significantly higher than in
the previous year. it is generally perceived
that a cad above 3 per cent of gdp is
difficult to sustain over the medium-term.
the challenge, therefore, is to rein in the
deficit over the medium-term and finance
it in the short-term. the medium-term task
has to receive policy focus from both the
government and the reserve bank. the
short-term task is to see that the current
account is fully financed while ensuring
that capital flows are not far out of line with
the economy’s absorptive capacity and that
the component of long-term and stable
flows in the overall capital flows is high.

ii. outlook and projections
advanced economies. reflecting global
linkages, the slowdown in the global
recovery will have an adverse impact on
growth in emes, including india,
especially through the trade channel.

global outlook
growth
28.
in its latest world economic
outlook, the imf has projected
global growth to slow down from
4.8 per cent in 2010 to 4.2 per cent in 2011.
various indicators of economic activity in
advanced economies point to deceleration
of growth in the second half of 2010 which
could persist through the first half of 2011.
the room to provide additional fiscal
stimulus to support the growth process
remains constrained due to debt
sustainability issues in some major

inflation
29.
inflation in advanced economies
in the short-term is expected to remain
subdued due to the prevailing low levels
of capacity utilisation and high
unemployment rates. however, the recent
upward movements in international
commodity prices, despite prospects of
slow global recovery, raise some
7

concerns. several emes are already
facing inflationary pressures. food,
energy and metal prices, in particular,
have seen significant increases. the
upward risk to inflation, therefore, has
increased for emes, both from rising
domestic capacity utilisation and from
global commodity price increases.

inflation
32.
although the headline inflation
has moderated in recent months, the
current rate of inflation is still well above
the comfort zone of the reserve bank.
the reserve bank’s quarterly inflation
expectation survey conducted during
the first fortnight of september 2010
indicates that short-term household
inflationary expectations have increased
marginally. further, notwithstanding
some moderation, food price inflation
has remained persistently elevated
for over a year now, reflecting in
part the structural demand-supply
mismatches in several commodities besides protein sources, oilseeds
and vegetables also show this pattern.
given the changing consumption patterns
and as yet inadequate supply response,
food price inflation is becoming
increasingly structural in nature.
further, even as non-food manufacturing
inflation has indeed moderated, it
still remains above its medium-term
trend.

domestic outlook
growth
30.
taking into account the good
performance of the agriculture sector,
and a range of indicators of industrial
production and service sector
activity amidst the prevailing global
macroeconomic scenario, the baseline
projection of real gdp growth for
2010-11, for policy purposes, is retained
at 8.5 per cent, as set out in the july 2010
review (chart 1).
31.
the reserve bank’s growth
projection for 2010-11 is consistent with
the median growth forecast from its
professional forecasters’ survey and other
agencies.

the projection remains unchanged from
that made in the july 2010 review
(chart 2).

33.
going forward, the inflation
outlook will be shaped by the following
factors. first, it will depend as to how food
price inflation evolves. second, rising
global commodity prices have become a
cause for concern. third, demand
pressures arising from sustained growth
amidst tightening capacity constraints will
have an impact. on balance, inflation is
expected to moderate from the present
elevated level, reflecting in parts, some
easing of supply constraints and concerted
policy action.

35.
the reserve bank will endeavour
to achieve price stability and anchor
inflation expectations. in pursuit of these
objectives, the reserve bank will continue
to evaluate an array of aggregate and
disaggregated measures of inflation in the
context of the evolving macroeconomic
situation.
36.
notwithstanding the current
inflation scenario, it is important to
recognise that in the 2000s, the average
headline inflation rate remained in the
range of 5.0-5.5 per cent, down from its
historical trend rate of about 7.5 per cent.
a combination of factors played a role in
this transformation. one of these was the
commitment on the part of the monetary
policy to keep inflation low and stable.
this record is an important foundation for
the credibility of monetary policy and,
more generally, the broader inflation
management framework. against this
backdrop, the conduct of monetary policy
will continue to condition and contain
perception of inflation in the range of

34.
in its july review, the reserve
bank made a baseline projection of wpi
inflation for march 2011 of 6.0 per cent.
this projection was based on the old series
of wpi. as has been indicated, there is
not much difference at the aggregate level
in the medium-term inflation trend
between the old and new series, but there
are significant differences at the group
levels. on the basis of currently available
information and the fact that expected
moderation in food price inflation has also
not fully materialised, the baseline
projection of wpi inflation for march
2011 has been placed at 5.5 per cent,
which is equivalent to 6.0 per cent under

4.0-4.5 per cent. this will be in line with
the medium-term objective of 3.0 per cent
inflation consistent with india’s broader
integration into the global economy.

compared to other major emes, a
widespread slowdown in global trade
cannot but have an impact on the
manufacturing and service sectors.

monetary aggregates

39.
second, although overall inflation
and non-food manufactured products
inflation have moderated in the recent
period, inflationary pressures remain
which may accentuate for several
reasons. despite the fragile global
recovery, international commodity prices
have risen in recent months due to strong
demand from emes and some
financialisation of commodities due to
large surplus global liquidity. should
there be further quantitative easing by
advanced economies, it will pose a
further risk to global commodity prices.
persistently high domestic food inflation
points to the presence of some structural
component, which will continue to weigh
on the overall inflation. with the
domestic capacity utilisation slowly
approaching the pre-crisis peak in many
industries, demand side pressures
may accentuate. going forward,
therefore, the risks to inflation are largely
on the upside.

37.
while the year-on-year money
supply (m 3) growth at 15.2 per cent in
early october 2010 was below the
indicative projection of 17.0 per cent, nonfood credit growth at 20.1 per cent was
close to the indicative projection of 20.0
per cent. there are already some signs of
pick-up in deposit and credit growth. it is
expected that monetary aggregates will
evolve along the projected trajectory
indicated in the april policy statement.
accordingly, the m3 and non-food credit
growth projections for 2010-11 have been
retained at 17 per cent and 20 per cent,
respectively. as always, these numbers are
indicative projections and not targets.
risk factors
38.
the above macroeconomic and
monetary projections are subject to a
number of upside and downside risks.
first, the main downside risk to growth
emanates from the prospects of a
prolonged slow and halting recovery
process in advanced economies as
evidenced by the recent indicators of
global economic activity. concerns are
being expressed that the ongoing fiscal
consolidation in the absence of revival of
private demand might weigh on the
recovery process. should the global
recovery falter, the growth performance of
emes, including india which has
remained robust so far, is likely to be
adversely affected. while india’s exports
as a percentage of gdp are relatively low

40.
third, given the weak recovery in
advanced economies, japan has already
resorted to further monetary easing
through unsterilised intervention in the
forex market. some other advanced
economies are in the process of resorting
to another round of quantitative easing.
given that growth prospects in emes,
including india, are much better, the
surplus liquidity generated by central
banks in advanced economies could flow
into the emes. in fact, the expectation of
further quantitative easing in advanced
10

imports on the back of strong rebound of
the domestic economy on the other.
although the current account deficit has
been easily financed by the rising capital
flows so far, the widening of the current
account deficit raises concerns given the
uncertainty associated with international
capital flows.

economies has already resulted in large
capital inflows to emes. as a result,
exchange rates have been appreciating and
asset prices have been rising in emes.
excess global liquidity combined with the
significant growth differential, interest
rate differential and higher financial
market returns in india vis-à-vis the
advanced economies might lead to
intensification of capital flows to india.
although india needs capital flows to
finance its widening current account
deficit, large capital flows beyond the
absorptive capacity of the economy could
pose a major challenge for exchange rate
and monetary management.

42.
fifth, asset prices in india, as in
many other emes, have risen sharply. the
equity market is close to its previous
all-time peak level. residential property
prices in metropolitan cities have gone
beyond the pre-crisis peak level.
gold prices are ruling at an all-time high
level. although the income levels of
households and earnings of corporates in
india have continued to rise, a sharp rise
in asset prices in such a short time causes
concern.

41.
fourth, india’s current account
deficit has widened in the recent period
due to slowing down of exports and
invisibles on the one hand and rising

iii. the policy stance
the economy is steadily regaining the precrisis growth trajectory. although
uncertainty persists with regard to global
recovery, india’s domestic growth drivers
are robust which should help absorb to a
large extent the negative impact of
slowdown in global recovery.

43.
since october 2009, the reserve
bank has cumulatively raised the cash
reserve ratio (crr) by 100 basis points,
and the repo and reverse repo rates under
the laf by 125 basis points and 175 basis
points, respectively. the monetary policy
response has been calibrated on the basis
of india’s specific growth-inflation
dynamics in the broader context of
persistent global uncertainty.

46.
second, inflation remains high.
both demand side and supply side factors
are at play. inflationary expectations also
remain at an elevated level. given the
spread and persistence of inflation,
demand side inflationary pressures need
to be contained and inflationary
expectations anchored.

44.
thus, our policy stance for 201011 for the remaining period has
been conditioned by three major
considerations:
45.
first, the domestic economy is on
a strong footing. the 8.8 per cent gdp
growth for q1 of 2010-11 suggests that

47.
third, even though a liquidity
deficit is consistent with an anti-inflation
11

stance, excessive deficiency can be
disruptive both to financial markets
and to credit growth in the banking
system. to ensure that economic activity
is not disrupted by liquidity constraints,
the liquidity deficit needs to be contained
within a reasonable limit.

being prepared to respond to any
further build-up of inflationary
pressures.

48.
against the above stated backdrop,
the stance of monetary policy is
intended to:
•

•

maintain an interest rate regime
consistent with price, output and
financial stability.

•

actively manage liquidity to
ensure that it remains broadly in
balance,
with
neither
a
surplus
diluting
monetary
transmission nor a deficit choking off
fund flows.

objectives of price and output stability.

the next mid-quarter review of
monetary policy for 2010-11 will be
announced through a press release on
december 16, 2010.

56.
based purely on current growth and
inflation trends, the reserve bank believes
that the likelihood of further rate actions in
the immediate future is relatively low.
however, in an uncertain world, we need
to be prepared to respond appropriately
to shocks that may emanate from either
the global or domestic environment.

monetary policy for 2010-11 is scheduled

part b. developmental and regulatory policies
59.
the recent global financial crisis
has underlined the need for fundamental
changes in the way banks and financial
institutions are regulated. important steps
in this regard at the international level
have been taken under the auspices of
g-20, financial stability board (fsb) and
basel committee on banking supervision
(bcbs). the broad elements of emerging
framework that have been agreed upon are
ring-fencing of banking institutions with
more and better quality capital under
basel iii, an appropriate framework for
systemically important financial
institutions (sifis), aligning the
compensation practices to prudent risktaking and long term value creation, and
improving the accounting standards, that
promote financial stability. india being a
member of g-20, fsb and bcbs, the

reserve bank has been actively associated
with the evolution of the reform package.
60.
the thrust of the regulation by the
reserve bank in recent years has not only
been on strengthening the financial
system, but also on developing financial
markets, promoting financial inclusion,
improving credit delivery, especially to
the small and medium enterprises (smes)
sector, improving customer service and
strengthening the payment and settlement
systems. the reserve bank, therefore,
will continue to pursue reforms in these
areas so as to enhance the efficiency and
stability of the financial system.
61. a synopsis of the action taken on the
past policy announcements together with
a list of fresh policy measures is set out
below.

i. financial stability
assessment of financial stability

financial stability report

63.
steps are being taken to strengthen
macro-prudential surveillance. towards this
end, more frequent internal assessments,
including systemic risk monitor reports
twice a year, have started. as per the latest
internal assessment, the financial system at
the current juncture is largely stable. the
banking sector is sound and the financial
sector is considered resilient to shocks
emanating from adverse domestic and
international developments. however,
evolving risks to financial stability, both
globally and within the country, need to be
monitored carefully on an ongoing basis.

and the findings thereof are shared with
financial institutions, market players and
general public in the form of financial
stability reports (fsrs). the first
fsr was published in march 2010.
the second fsr will be published in
december 2010. going forward, fsrs
will be published in june and december
every year.

ii. interest rate policy
on savings bank deposits has remained
unchanged at 3.5 per cent per annum since
march 1, 2003. keeping in view
progressive deregulation of interest rates,
it is proposed:

base rate
64.
as indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010, the system
of base rate came into effect on july 1,
2010. the transition from the benchmark
prime lending rate (bplr) system to the
base rate system has been smooth.

66.
the discussion paper will be
placed on the reserve bank’s website by
end-december 2010 for feedback from the
general public.

as a part of financial sector
reforms, the reserve bank has deregulated
interest rates on deposits, other than
savings bank deposits. the interest rate

the final guidelines on the issuance of
non-convertible debentures (ncds) of
maturity less than one year by end-june
2010. accordingly, keeping in view the
feedback received, the guidelines on
ncds were issued in june 2010, which
came into force with effect from august
2, 2010. the guidelines, among others,
covered eligibility criteria to issue
ncds, rating requirement, maturity,
denomination, limits and amount of issue
of ncds and responsibilities of
corporates, debenture trustees and credit
rating agencies.

interest rate futures
67.
the monetary policy statement of
april 2010 had indicated that exchange
traded interest rate futures (irfs) on
5-year and 2-year notional coupon bearing
government of india securities and 91-day
treasury bills would be introduced. it was
also indicated that the rbi-sebi standing
technical committee would finalise the
product design and operational modalities.
the issue relating to product design was
deliberated by the rbi-sebi standing
technical committee. the reserve bank
will introduce such irfs after taking into
account the experiences of cash-settled
irf regimes in other countries.

introduction of credit default swaps
69.
it was indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010 that the
draft report of the internal working group
on introduction of credit default swap
(cds) for corporate bonds would be
placed on the reserve bank’s website by
end-july 2010. accordingly, the draft

the revised draft guidelines on the subject
were again placed on the reserve bank’s
website in july 2010 for final comments
by august 13, 2010. comments received
from stakeholders were examined and
deliberated in the meeting of the technical
advisory committee on the money,
foreign exchange and government
securities markets. final guidelines in the
light of the feedback received will be
issued by end-november 2010.

report was placed on the reserve bank’s
website on august 4, 2010 for public
comments till october 4, 2010. the
comments/suggestions received are being
examined by holding wider consultations
with all the stakeholders, including
corporates.
repo in corporate bonds
70.
for development of the corporate
bond market, the reserve bank had issued
guidelines in january 2010, permitting
repo in corporate bonds, subject to certain
terms and conditions. to further facilitate
repo transactions in corporate bonds, a
review of the guidelines governing repo
in corporate bonds has been undertaken
by the reserve bank in consultation with
the market participants. accordingly, it has
been decided:
•

introduction of exchange traded
currency option contracts
73.
it was indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010 that the
reserve bank would permit the
recognised stock exchanges to introduce
plain vanilla currency options on spot us
dollar/rupee exchange rate for residents.
in july 2010, the reserve bank permitted
trading of currency options on spot usdinr rate in the currency derivatives
segment of the recognised stock
exchanges. the currency options market
will function subject to the guidelines
issued by the reserve bank and the
securities and exchange board of india
(sebi) from time to time.

to permit settlement of repo in
corporate bonds on a t+0 basis in
addition to the existing t+1 and t+2
basis and revise the repo haircut
requirements suitably.

71.
detailed guidelines, which will be
effective december 1, 2010, are being
issued separately.
guidelines on over-the-counter
forex derivatives

money market
working group to review the operating
procedure of monetary policy

72.
the draft guidelines on over-thecounter (otc) foreign exchange
derivatives were placed on the reserve
bank’s website in november 2009 for
public comments. the feedback received
from stakeholders was discussed in the
meeting of the technical advisory
committee on the money, foreign
exchange and government securities

74.
as announced in the first quarter
review of monetary policy of july 2010,
the reserve bank, on october 4, 2010,
constituted a working group to review the
current operating procedure of monetary
policy, including the liquidity adjustment
facility (chairman: shri deepak mohanty),

iv. credit delivery and financial inclusion
credit flow to the micro, small and
medium enterprises sector

of micro enterprise accounts and a 20
per cent year-on-year growth in credit to
the mse sector. the reserve bank is
closely monitoring the achievement of
targets by banks in this regard.

high level task force on msmes
76.
a high level task force
constituted by the government
(chairman: shri t.k.a. nair) to consider
various issues raised by micro, small
and medium enterprises (msmes)
associations and draw up an agenda for
action submitted its report in january
2010. in terms of the recommendations of
the task force, the reserve bank issued
guidelines in june 2010, advising
scheduled commercial banks that the
allocation of 60 per cent of the micro and
small enterprises (mses) advances to the
micro enterprises was to be achieved in
stages, viz., 50 per cent in the year
2010-11, 55 per cent in the year 2011-12
and 60 per cent in the year 2012-13.
further, banks were mandated to achieve
a 10 per cent annual growth in the number

rural credit institutions
licensing of co-operatives
77.
the committee on financial
sector assessment (chairman: dr. rakesh
mohan and co-chairman: shri ashok
chawla) had recommended that rural
co-operative banks, which failed to obtain
a licence by 2012, should not be allowed
to operate. accordingly, it was proposed
in the annual policy statement of
april 2009 to work out a roadmap for
licensing of unlicensed state and central
co-operative banks in a non-disruptive
manner. for this purpose, revised
guidelines, in consultation with national
bank for agriculture and rural
17

nabard and a few state governments to
study the functioning of well-run pacs,
large adivasi multi-purpose co-operative
societies (lamps), farmers service
societies (fss) and thrift and credit
co-operative societies set up under the
parallel self-reliant co-operative
societies acts to gather information on
their working and assess their potential to
contribute to financial inclusion.
accordingly, the reserve bank, in
association with nabard and the
concerned state governments, is studying
the working of select (about 220)
well-functioning rural co-operatives
across the country to assess their potential
to contribute to financial inclusion. the
study is expected to be completed by
end-january 2011.

development (nabard), were issued on
licensing of these banks. subsequent to the
issuance of revised guidelines on licensing
of state co-operative banks (stcbs)/
district central co-operative banks
(dccbs), 10 stcbs and 133 dccbs have
been licensed, bringing down the number
of unlicensed stcbs from 17 to 7 and
dccbs from 296 to 163 as on september
30, 2010.
revival of the rural co-operative
credit structure
78.
the government of india, based on
the recommendations of the task force on
revival of rural co-operative credit
institutions (chairman: prof. a.
vaidyanathan) and in consultation with the
state governments, had approved a
package for revival of the short-term rural
co-operative credit structure. as envisaged
in the package, 25 states have so far
entered
into
memorandum
of
understanding (mou) with the
government of india and nabard.
sixteen states have made necessary
amendments to their respective
co-operative societies acts. as on
august 31, 2010, an aggregate amount
of about `7,990 crore has been released
by nabard to primary agricultural
credit societies (pacs) in 14 states as the
government of india’s share under the
package.

liberalisation in branch licensing
of regional rural banks
80.
as part of further liberalisation of
the extant branch licensing policy in
respect of regional rural banks (rrbs), it
is proposed:
•

to allow rrbs to open branches in
tier 3 to tier 6 centres as identified in
the census 2001 (with population up
to 49,999) without prior authorisation
of the reserve bank, subject to their
fulfilling certain conditions.

81.
detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued separately.

financial inclusion through
grass-root co-operatives

priority sector lending
82.
as announced in the second
quarter review of october 2009, a
working group was constituted
(chairman: shri v. k. sharma) to

79.
it was proposed in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010 to
constitute a committee comprising
representatives from the reserve bank,
18

the same to the reserve bank by march
2010. domestic scheduled commercial
banks have since prepared and submitted
their fips to the reserve bank. these
plans have been discussed with major
banks and revised plans based on the
discussions have been submitted by banks.
to closely monitor the progress made in
implementation of these plans, a quarterly
reporting format has been communicated
to banks and the implementation of these
plans is being closely monitored by the
reserve bank.

examine the pros and cons of priority
sector lending certificates (pslcs) as
recommended by the committee on
financial sector reforms (chairman:
dr. raghuram g. rajan). as indicated in
the monetary policy statement of april
2010, the terms of reference of the
working group were expanded to review
the pros and cons of inclusion of bank
lending to micro-finance institutions
(mfis) under priority sector lending. the
working group submitted its report in
august 2010. however, considering the
more recent developments in the mfi
space, a sub-committee of the central
board of the reserve bank (chairman:
shri y. h. malegam) has been constituted
to examine the various issues relating to
micro-finance extended by non-banking
financial companies (nbfcs) while also
taking into account the recommendation
of the sharma working group. the subcommittee will make recommendations,
among others, relating to regulation of
micro-finance activities of nbfcs,
especially with regard to issues
impinging on borrowers’ interests. the
sub-committee is expected to submit its
report by end-january 2011. a holistic
view will be taken on issues relating to
pslcs and bank lending to mfis under
priority sector lending after the malegam
sub-committee submits its report.

roadmap for provision of banking
services in villages with population
of over 2000
84.
in pursuance of the announcement
made in the monetary policy statement of
april 2010, the roadmap to provide
banking services in every village with a
population of over 2000 has been finalised
by state level bankers’ committees
(slbcs) and 73,113 unbanked identified
villages as per 2001 census have been
allotted to various banks for provision of
banking services by march 2012. the time
line for provision of banking services has
been extended to march 2012 from march
2011 in line with the finance minister’s
announcement in the union budget
2010-11. march 2011 is retained as an
intermediate target. the progress in the
implementation of the roadmap is being
discussed and closely monitored by
respective slbcs.

financial inclusion plan for banks
83.
considering the objective of
increasing banking outreach for financial
inclusion, domestic scheduled commercial
banks, both in the public and private
sectors, were advised, among others, to put
in place a board approved three-year
financial inclusion plan (fip) and submit

opening of sub-offices of the reserve
bank in north-eastern states
85.
at present, the reserve bank has
only one office at guwahati to cater to the
19

individuals/entities permitted earlier,
subject to compliance with the guidelines
issued in september 2010.

needs of all the north-eastern states. over
a period of time, while the population of
these states and banking needs have
increased significantly, bank branches
have not kept pace with the requirements
in these areas. considering the
relative economic and infrastructural
backwardness of these states and the need
for financial inclusion and general
economic development in these states, it
has been decided:
•

urban co-operative banks
licenses for setting up new urban
co-operative banks
87.
as indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010, an expert
committee (chairman: shri y. h.
malegam) was constituted in october
2010 with representations from all
stakeholders for studying the advisability
of granting licenses for setting up new
urban co-operative banks (ucbs) under
section 22 of the banking regulation act,
1949 [as applicable to co-operative
socieities (aacs)]. the committee is
expected to submit its report in six months.
the committee will also look into the
feasibility of an umbrella organisation for
the ucb sector.

to open sub-offices of the reserve
bank in the remaining six states of the
north-east, viz., arunachal pradesh,
nagaland, manipur, mizoram, tripura
and meghalaya, in a phased manner.

business correspondents - relaxations
86.
in pursuance of the announcement
made in the monetary policy statement
of april 2010, the reserve bank issued
guidelines in april 2010 permitting banks
to engage any individual, including those
operating common service centres (cscs)
as banking correspondents (bcs), subject
to banks’ comfort level and their carrying
out suitable due diligence as also
instituting additional safeguards as may
be considered appropriate to minimise the
agency risks. a discussion paper on
“engagement of ‘for profit’ companies as
business correspondent” was placed on
the reserve bank’s website in august
2010 inviting comments from the
public by august 20, 2010. taking into
consideration the pros and cons and based
on the feedback received from various
quarters, banks were permitted to engage
companies registered under the
indian companies act, 1956, excluding
nbfcs, as bcs in addition to the

extension of area of operation
of ucbs
88.
in order to further facilitate the
growth of well managed and financially
sound ucbs, it is proposed:

20

•

to withdraw the existing restrictions
on granting multi-state status and
extension of area of operation beyond
the state of registration for such ucbs
having a minimum net worth of `50
crore;

•

to allow such ucbs which have
acquired weak banks in other state(s)
to extend the area of operation to the
entire state of registration of the target
bank provided they have minimum net
worth of `50 crore; and

•

to allow tier ii ucbs registered or
deemed to be registered under the
multi-state co-operative societies
act, 2002 to extend area of operation
to the entire state of original
registration.

enhancement of limits on unsecured
loans and advances granted by ucbs
93.
keeping in view the growth in
business of the ucbs over the years, it is
proposed:
•

89.
detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued separately.
liberalisation of branch licensing
policy for ucbs
90.
in order to further liberalise
the branch licensing policy for
urban co-operative banks (ucbs), it is
proposed:
•

94.
detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued separately.

to allow well managed and financially
sound ucbs to open branches
and extension counters within
their existing/approved area of
operation, beyond the current ceiling
of 10 per cent as long as they have
sufficient headroom capital for each
branch.

exposure of ucbs to housing loans
95.
at present, ucbs can provide
housing, real estate and commercial real
estate loans up to 15 per cent of their
deposit resources as on march 31 of the
previous year. it has now been decided to
link housing, real estate and commercial
real estate loans of ucbs to their total
assets instead of deposits. accordingly, it
is proposed:

91.
detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued separately.

to replace the existing limit of 15
per cent of deposits for housing, real
estate and commercial real estate
loans by a limit of 10 per cent of total
assets; and

•

an additional limit of 5 per cent of
total assets will be available for
housing loans granted to individuals
by the ucbs for purchase/
construction of dwelling units up to
`10 lakh.

92.
with a view to expanding the
outreach of the ucbs, thereby furthering
the objective of financial inclusion, it is
proposed:
•

to enhance the existing limits on
individual unsecured loans and
advances extended by the ucbs,
which are complying with the
regulatory capital to risk-weighted
assets ratio (crar) of 9 per cent,
subject to the overall ceiling of 10
per cent of total assets.

to allow well managed and financially
sound ucbs to engage business
correspondents (bcs)/business
facilitators (bfs) using information
and communication technology (ict)
solutions.

exemption from share linking to
borrowing norm

having a minimum net worth of `25
crore.

96.
it is mandatory for borrowers of
ucbs to subscribe to the shares of the
bank to the extent of 2.5-5.0 per cent of
their borrowings. in order to provide
flexibility to ucbs, which are already
well capitalised to extend loans without
adding to capital, it is proposed:
•

customer service
98.
pursuant to the announcement
made in the monetary policy statement
of april 2010, a committee on customer
service (chairman: shri m. damodaran)
was constituted to look into banking
services rendered to retail and small
customers, including pensioners.
the committee will also look into the
system of grievance redressal mechanism
prevalent in banks – its structure and
efficacy – and suggest measures for
expeditious resolution of complaints.
the committee will also examine
the international experiences in this
regard. a need for conducting on-site
inspection and rating banks on customer
service will be examined based on the
outcome of the report of the committee.
the committee is expected to submit its
report by end-january 2011.

to exempt ucbs which maintain a
minimum crar of 12 per cent on a
continuous basis from the mandatory
share linking norms.

access to infinet membership, current/
sgl accounts with the reserve bank and
rtgs membership for ucbs
97.
in order to enable ucbs to serve
their customers better, it is proposed:
•

•

to allow all licensed ucbs (other than
those under all inclusive directions)
the facility of indian financial
network (infinet) membership,
current and subsidiary general ledger
(sgl) accounts with the reserve
bank; and

99.
as indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010,
banks were advised in may 2010
to devote exclusive time in a board
meeting once in every six months to
review and deliberate on customer service.

to allow real time gross settlement
(rtgs) membership to only well
managed and financially sound ucbs

v. regulatory and supervisory measures for commercial banks
strengthening the resilience of
the banking sector

and its governing body - the group
of central bank governors and heads of
supervision (ghos) - to strengthen the
resilience of banks and the global banking
system. the new global standards to
address both bank-specific and broader
systemic risks have been referred to as

100. the basel committee on banking
supervision (bcbs), in response to the
financial crisis, submitted a report to the
g-20 in october 2010. the report
contained the measures taken by the bcbs
22

parallel run should continue for a
period of three years, i.e., till march
31, 2013, subject to review.

basel iii. measures suggested under basel
iii, among others, include revisions to the
definition of regulatory capital, capital
conservation buffer, counter-cyclical
buffer, the treatment of counterparty credit
risk, the leverage ratio, and the global
liquidity standards.

implementation of advanced
approaches under basel ii
framework
103. the reserve bank had announced
timeline for implementation of advanced
approaches for computation of regulatory
capital under the basel ii framework in
india in july 2009. the guidelines for the
standardised approach (tsa)/alternate
standardised approach (asa) for
operational risk were issued in march
2010 and those for internal models
approach (ima) for market risk were
issued in april 2010. guidelines for
advanced measurement approach (ama)
for operational risk will be finalised by
december 2010. guidelines for internal
rating based approach for credit risk are
under preparation.

101. it may be recalled that the bcbs
had issued in december 2009 two
consultative documents for public
comments. it also undertook a
comprehensive quantitative impact study
(qis) and top-down calibration of
minimum capital requirement. at its july
and september 2010 meetings, the ghos
broadly agreed on the overall design of the
capital and liquidity reform package,
based on the comments received,
the qis and top-down calibration.
the fully calibrated basel iii rules
will be published by the bcbs by
end-december 2010.

housing loans by commercial banks

102. the reserve bank has been
adopting the international best regulatory
practices as appropriate to banks in india.
banks are, therefore, advised:
•

to study the new developments and be
in preparedness to meet the
requirements; and

•

to continue with the parallel run
beyond march 31, 2010, as advised
to them in april 2010, to ensure
that their basel ii minimum
capital requirement continues to be
higher than the prudential floor of
80 per cent of the minimum capital
requirement as per basel i framework
for credit and market risks. the

loan to value ratio in housing loans
104. at present, there is no regulatory
ceiling on the loan to value (ltv) ratio in
respect of banks’ housing loan exposures.
in order to prevent excessive leveraging,
it is proposed:
•

that the ltv ratio in respect of
housing loans hereafter should not
exceed 80 per cent.

risk weights on residential
housing loans
105. at present, the risk weights on
residential housing loans with ltv ratio
up to 75 per cent are 50 per cent for loans
23

financial services companies. banks may
be able to exercise control on such entities
through their direct or indirect holdings
or have significant influence over them.
thus, banks may indirectly undertake
activities not permitted to them under
sub-section (1) of section 6 of the
banking regulation act, 1949 or activities
which are not conducive to the spread of
banking in india or otherwise useful or
necessary in the public interest. therefore,
it is proposed:

up to `30 lakh and 75 per cent for loans
above that amount. in case the ltv ratio
is more than 75 per cent, the risk weight
of all housing loans, irrespective of the
amount of loan, is 100 per cent.
accordingly, it is proposed:
•

to increase the risk weight for
residential housing loans of `75 lakh
and above, irrespective of the ltv
ratio, to 125 per cent.

teaser rates for housing loans

•

106. it has been observed that some
banks are following the practice of
sanctioning housing loans at ‘teaser rates’,
wherein the loans are offered at a
comparatively lower rate of interest in the
first few years, after which rates are reset
at higher rates. this practice raises
concern as some borrowers may find it
difficult to service the loans once the
normal interest rate, which is higher than
the rate applicable in the initial years,
becomes effective. it has been observed
that many banks at the time of initial loan
appraisal do not take into account the
repaying capacity of the borrower at
normal lending rates. in view of the higher
risk associated with such loans, it is
proposed:
•

to stipulate prudential limits to
regulate the investments of banks in
companies engaged in forms of
business other than financial services.
banks will be required to review their
investments in such companies and be
compliant with the guidelines as per
the roadmap to be laid down.

108. detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued separately.
prudential norms on financial
conglomerates
109. the reserve bank had constituted
an internal group on the supervision of
financial conglomerates (fcs) in india.
the internal group had made various
recommendations for strengthening the
supervision of the fcs, including changes
in certain regulatory norms. the annual
policy statement of april 2009 indicated
that the reserve bank was examining the
recommendations of the group from the
regulatory and supervisory perspectives.
to start with, it has been decided:

to increase the standard asset
provisioning by commercial banks for
all such loans to 2 per cent.

banks’ investments in
non-financial companies
107. under the extant prudential
framework, banks are not required to
obtain prior approval of the reserve bank
for investment in companies other than

•

24

to implement the recommendations of
the group on (i) capital adequacy for

intra-group transactions and
exposures in fcs

fcs; and (ii) intra-group transactions
and exposures in fcs.
capital adequacy for fcs

112. in order to limit the interconnectedness between the bank and other
group entities, it is proposed:

110. as per basel ii framework,
investments in the equity of subsidiaries
or significant minority investments in
banking, securities and other financial
entities, where control does not exist,
together with other regulatory capital
investment in these entities are required
to be excluded from the banking group’s
capital if these entities are not
consolidated. the group recommended
that the threshold of significant influence/
investment may be fixed at 20 per cent
instead of the present 30 per cent.
accordingly, it is proposed:
•

that the entire investments in the paid
up equity of the entities (including
insurance entities), where such
investment exceeds 20 per cent of the
paid up equity of such entities shall
be deducted at 50 per cent from
tier i and 50 per cent from tier ii
capital when these are not
consolidated for capital purposes
with the bank. in addition, entire
investments in other instruments
eligible for regulatory capital status
in these entities shall also be
deducted at 50 per cent from tier i
and 50 per cent from tier ii capital;
and

•

the deductions indicated above will
also be applicable while computing
capital adequacy ratio of the bank on
a solo basis.

•

to put in place an appropriate limit for
such transactions and exposures, both
for a single entity and on an aggregate
basis for all other group entities.

113. detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued separately.
principles for enhancing corporate
governance in banking organisations
114. the bcbs in october 2010 issued
‘principles for enhancing corporate
governance’ for banking organisations.
the principles address fundamental
deficiencies in bank corporate
governance that became apparent during
the financial crisis. taking into account
different categories of banking
organisations in india, the reserve bank
has been taking appropriate steps to
improve corporate governance standards
in banks. implementations of ‘fit and
proper’ criteria for directors on the boards
of banks and splitting of post of the
chairman and managing director in
private sectors banks as per the
recommendations of the ganguly
committee (2002) are some of the
notable steps taken by the reserve bank
in this direction in the recent past, which
have improved standard of corporate
governance. however, a review of the
corporate governance standard in the
banks is necessitated in the light of the
principles issued by the bcbs.
accordingly, it is proposed:

111. the capital adequacy requirement
will be further calibrated after finalisation
of the basel iii rules, as indicated earlier.
25

•

to take appropriate steps to fully align
the corporate governance practices in
banks in india with the principles
enunciated by the bcbs.

formulation of operational guidelines in
the context of convergence of indian
accounting standards with the
international financial reporting
standards (ifrss) and prepare banking
and nbfcs and ucbs to adhere to the
roadmap of implementation. as per the
roadmap, all scheduled commercial banks
will convert their opening balance sheet
as on april 1, 2013 in compliance with the
accounting standards converged with the
ifrs. as regards nbfcs and ucbs, a
gradualist approach has been adopted.

115. detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued separately.
working group on valuation
adjustment and treatment of
illiquid positions
116. it was indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010 to
constitute a working group to recommend
an appropriate framework for valuation
adjustment for various risks/costs and
treatment of illiquid positions.
accordingly, a working group
(co-ordinator: shri p. r. ravi mohan) was
set up in june 2010 with members
drawn from the reserve bank, iba,
fimmda, foreign exchange dealers
association of india (fedai) and select
banks. the working group submitted its
report in september 2010. the group has
given recommendations on a wide range
of issues, including identification of
illiquid positions, adjustment for
illiquidity and valuation adjustment for
unearned credit spread and closeout costs
for the derivative portfolio of banks. the
recommendations of the group are under
examination.

introduction of bank holding
company/financial holding
company in india
118. in pursuance of the announcement
made in the monetary policy statement
of april 2010, a working group
(chairperson: smt. shyamala gopinath)
has been constituted to examine the
introduction of a holding company
structure together with the required
legislative amendment/framework. the
work is in progress.
compensation practices
119. in line with the steps taken by the
global community and the initiatives taken
by g-20 nations, draft guidelines for
private sector banks and foreign banks
with regard to sound compensation policy
were framed and placed on the reserve
bank’s website in july 2010 for public
comments. these guidelines are largely
based on the fsb’s principles on
sound compensation practices. the
guidelines cover effective governance of
compensation, alignment of compensation
with prudent risk-taking and disclosures

convergence of indian accounting
standards with international
financial reporting standards
117. as indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010, a working
group (chairman: shri p. r. ravi mohan)
was constituted to address the
implementation issues and facilitate
26

discussion paper on the mode of presence
of foreign banks through branch or whollyowned subsidiary (wos) would be
prepared by september 2010. accordingly,
a discussion paper in consultation with the
government on the form of presence of
foreign banks in india is in final stages of
preparation.

for whole time directors/chief executive
officers, risk takers of banks as well
as staff in the audit, compliance and
risk management functions. comments
received
from
various
banks/
organisations/individuals are being
examined. accordingly, it is proposed:
•

to
issue
final
guidelines
on compensation practices by
end-december 2010.

capacity building in banks
122. banks should gear themselves up
to meet various challenges in the coming
years. in particular, the implementation of
basel iii by all banks, the need for large
and internationally active banks to move
to the advanced approaches under basel
ii and convergence with ifrs as on
april 1, 2013 would require banks to
upgrade their technology and risk
management capabilities. banks should
undertake a review of the skills required
and take up capacity building in right
earnest and in a time bound manner. the
reserve bank will also intensify its efforts
in this regard by undertaking more
capacity building programmes for the
banking sector in the coming years.

licensing of new banks
120. the hon’ble finance minister in
the union budget 2010-11 had mentioned
that the reserve bank would consider
giving some additional bank licences to
private sector players. consequently, the
monetary policy statement of april 2010
indicated that a discussion paper would be
prepared marshalling the international
practices, the indian experience as also the
extant ownership and governance (o&g)
guidelines for placing it on the reserve
bank’s website by end-july 2010 for wider
comments and feedback, after which the
guidelines will be finalised. accordingly,
the discussion paper was put in public
domain in august 2010. based on the
comments and suggestions received from
various parties and discussions held with
major stakeholders in october 2010, it is
proposed:
•

information technology and
related issues: enhancement
to the guidelines
123. it was proposed in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010 to set up a
working group on information security,
electronic banking, technology risk
management, and tackling cyber frauds.
accordingly, a working group on
electronic banking, controls, governance
and technology risk management
standards
(chairman:
shri
g.
gopalakrishna) was constituted. the

to put the draft guidelines in public
domain by end-january 2011 for
public comments.

presence of foreign banks in india
121. it was indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010 that
drawing lessons from the crisis, a
27

working group and are now being
formalised. the working group is likely
to finalise its report by end-november
2010.

recommendations of the sub-groups on
technology, governance, operational
issues, legal and educational aspects set
up by the group were discussed by the

arrangement.

payment and settlement systems
membership to the committee on
payment and settlement systems

126. the iba and national payments
corporation of india (npci) have been
jointly vested with the responsibility for
implementation of the new cheque
standards.

124. india became a member of the
committee on payment and settlement
systems (cpss) constituted under the
aegis of the bank for international
settlements (bis). the reserve bank is
represented on four working groups
of cpss, viz., (i) general review
of standards; (ii) repo market
infrastructure; (iii) post trade services;
and (iv) retail payment systems.

operationalisation of national
payments corporation of india
127. as indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010, the npci
has the envisioned role to look at future
innovations in the retail payment space in
the country. the npci has implemented a
pilot project for settlement of inter-bank
mobile payments. further, the roll-out of
the grid-based cheque truncation system
(cts) project at chennai is likely to be
operationalised by the end of march 2011.

standardisation of security
features on cheque forms
125. as indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010, a cheque
truncation system (cts)-2010 standard
with benchmark specifications for security
features on cheques and field placements
on cheque forms has been prescribed. the
cts-2010 standard, inter alia, included a
prescription prohibiting alterations/
corrections on cheque forms. it has since
been clarified that the prescription is
applicable only to cheques cleared under
the image-based cheque truncation system
and will be effective december 1, 2010.
the prescription will not be applicable to
cheques cleared under magnetic ink
character recognition (micr) clearing,
non-micr clearing, otc collection
(for cash payment) or direct collection of

performance of national electronic
funds transfer system
128. as at end-july 2010, around
70,000 branches of 98 banks had
participated in the national electronic
funds transfer (neft) system and the
volume of transactions processed
increased to 9.5 million in july 2010.
automated data flow from banks
129. as indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010, a core
group consisting of experts from banks,
the reserve bank, the institute
28

for development and research in banking
technology (idrbt) and the iba has
been constituted for preparing an approach
paper on automated data flow (a straight
through process) from the core banking
solution (cbs) or other it systems of
commercial banks to the reserve bank.
the core group has prepared an approach
paper, which deals with automated data
flow from banks to the reserve bank.
the paper, inter alia, discusses the
methodology to be adopted by banks to
classify themselves into a cluster based on
its technology and process dimensions.
based on this, estimated timelines for
achieving complete automation of
submission of returns have also been
furnished. the approach paper is being
examined and it is expected to be
circulated to the banks for necessary
action at their end.

volume and the values that it has been
processing since its inception in march
2004. with the increased number of
electronic payment transactions, it has
become expedient to position the indian
rtgs system primarily for processing and
settling large value payment orders.
further, the reserve bank has set up a
robust retail electronic funds transfer
system in the form of neft, with near
real-time settlement finality with 11
settlement cycles in a day. accordingly, it
has been decided, in consultation with
system participants:
•

to increase the threshold limit for
rtgs transactions from the present
limit of `1 lakh to `2 lakh.

132. as a further incentive to
customers to move their transactions to
neft, a new value band in the `1 lakh to
` 2 lakh will be created, with customers
having to pay lower charges vis-à-vis
rtgs transactions.

130. the approach suggested for banks
will be implemented in two phases. in the
first phase, banks would be required to
ensure seamless flow of data from their
transaction server to their management
information system (mis) server and
generate all returns from the mis server
automatically, without any manual
intervention. in the second phase, the
reserve bank would introduce a pull
mechanism for the flow of data from the
mis server of banks in a straight through
process. the timeline of the entire project
will be determined in consultation with
banks.

133. the detailed guidelines in this
regard will be issued separately.
134. as indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010, a
working group comprising representatives
from the reserve bank and select
commercial banks, viz., sbi, pnb,
icici bank and hdfc bank was
constituted for preparing an approach for
implementation of next generation rtgs.
the group submitted its report in august
2010, which has since been accepted. the
implementation of the next generation
rtgs system is in progress, which may
take about two years for completion.

real time gross settlement system
131. the indian rtgs has displayed
tremendous growth in both transactions
29

now, 1,108 branches (other than currency
chest branches) have been identified
having average daily cash receipt of
`1 crore and above. banks have reported
that note sorting machines have been
installed and made operational in 669
branches. for the remaining branches,
banks have made arrangements with the
nearest currency chest branch/currency
administration branch. it was also indicated
in the second quarter review of october
2009 that banks should use such machines
in all their branches having average daily
cash receipts between ` 50 lakh and
` 1 crore by march 2011. banks are
expected to enhance their efforts to reach
this position by march 31, 2011.

cheque truncation system
135. the cts was successfully
implemented in the national capital
region of new delhi in february 2008.
following complete migration to cts,
the separate micr clearing was
discontinued from july 2009. the cts,
on an average, processes over 0.5 million
instruments per day. the next roll out of
cts is planned for march 2011 at
chennai, with the project being
implemented by the npci. the process
of roll out will be a grid-based approach
to cover the clearing houses in the other
cities of tamil nadu and the adjoining
states of kerala and karnataka.
simultaneously, efforts are underway to
establish common disaster recovery (dr)
arrangements for both new delhi and
chennai cts operations.

137. as indicated in the second quarter
review of october 2009, banks were
advised to have the responsibility of
currency management entrusted to a nodal
official of the rank not less than that of a
general manager and will be accountable
for the obligations cast upon currency
chests by the reserve bank. all
commercial banks have since appointed
nodal officers.

currency management
136. banks were mandated to use note
sorting machines in all their branches
having average daily cash receipts of
`1 crore and above by march 2010. as of
