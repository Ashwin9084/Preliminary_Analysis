third bi-monthly monetary policy statement, 2014-15
by dr. raghuram g. rajan, governor
monetary and liquidity measures
on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic
situation, it has been decided to:
•

keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (laf)
unchanged at 8.0 per cent;

•

keep the cash reserve ratio (crr) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per
cent of net demand and time liabilities (ndtl);

•

reduce the statutory liquidity ratio (slr) of scheduled commercial banks by 50
basis points from 22.5 per cent to 22.0 per cent of their ndtl with effect from
the fortnight beginning august 9, 2014; and

•

continue to provide liquidity under overnight repos at 0.25 per cent of bankwise ndtl and liquidity under 7-day and 14-day term repos of up to 0.75 per
cent of ndtl of the banking system.

consequently, the reverse repo rate under the laf will remain unchanged at
7.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (msf) rate and the bank rate at 9.0
per cent.
assessment
2.
since the second bi-monthly monetary policy statement of june 2014, global
economic activity has been picking up at a modest space from a sharp slowdown in
q1. investor risk appetite has buoyed financial markets, partly drawing strength from
assurances of continuing monetary policy support in industrial countries. portfolio
flows to emerging market economies (emes) have risen strongly. this implies,
however, that emes remain vulnerable to changes in investor risk appetite driven by
any reassessment of the future path of us monetary policy or possible escalation of
geopolitical tensions.
3.
sentiment on domestic economic activity appears to be reviving, with incoming
data suggesting a firming up of industrial growth and exports. the june round of the
reserve bank’s industrial outlook survey also points to improvement in business
expectations in q2. leading indicators of the services sector are mixed, although
there are early signs of modest strengthening of corporate sales and business flows.
while the initial slow progress of the monsoon and its uneven spatial distribution

2
raised serious concerns regarding agricultural production, these have been mitigated,
though not entirely dispelled, by the pick-up in the monsoon through much of the
country in july. the implementation of government policy actions that have been
announced should create a congenial setting for a steady improvement in domestic
demand and supply conditions.
4.
retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (cpi) has eased for the
second consecutive month in june, with a broad-based moderation accompanied by
deceleration in momentum. higher prices of vegetables, fruits and protein-based food
items were offset by the muted increase in the prices of non-food items, particularly
those of household requisites and transport and communication. cpi inflation
excluding food and fuel decelerated further, extending the decline that began in
september 2013. however, with some continuing uncertainty about the path of the
monsoon, it would be premature to conclude that future food inflation, and its spillover to broader inflation, can be discounted.
5.
liquidity conditions have remained broadly stable, barring episodic tightness
on account of movements in the cash balances of the government maintained with
the reserve bank. while the system’s recourse to liquidity from the laf, and regular
and additional term repos has been around 1.0 per cent of the ndtl of banks,
access to the msf has been minimal and temporary. in order to manage transient
liquidity pressures associated with tax outflows and sluggish spending by the
government, the reserve bank injected additional liquidity aggregating over ` 940
billion through nine special term repos of varying maturities during the months of
june and july. despite the reduction in the export credit refinance effected in early
june, average utilisation of the facility has only been around 70 per cent of the
available limit. the reserve bank will review existing liquidity arrangements and
continue to monitor and manage liquidity to ensure adequate flow of credit to the
productive sectors.
6.
with the buoyancy in export performance sustained through q1, the trade
deficit has narrowed from its level a year ago. while oil imports rose in june partly on
higher international crude prices, gold import growth picked up in response to some
liberalization of import restrictions, and non-oil non-gold import growth has turned
positive since may. turning to external financing, all categories of capital flows have
been buoyant. surges in capital inflows in excess of the current account financing
requirement and the repayment of swaps by oil marketing companies have bolstered
international reserves.
policy stance and rationale
7.
the moderation in cpi headline inflation for two consecutive months, despite
the seasonal firming up of prices of fruits and vegetables since march, is due to both
base effects and the steady deceleration in cpi inflation excluding food and fuel. the
recent fall in international crude prices, the benign outlook on global non-oil
commodity prices and still-subdued corporate pricing power should all support
continued disinflation, as should measures undertaken to improve food management.
there are, however, upside risks also, in the form of the pass-through of
administered price increases, continuing uncertainty over monsoon conditions and
their impact on food production, possibly higher oil prices stemming from geo-political
concerns and exchange rate movement, and strengthening growth in the face of
continuing supply constraints. accordingly, the upside risks to the target of ensuring
cpi inflation at or below 8 per cent by january 2015 remain, although overall risks
are more balanced than in june (chart 1). it is, therefore, appropriate to continue

3
maintaining a vigilant monetary policy stance as in june, while leaving the policy rate
unchanged.

8.
prospects for reinvigoration of growth have improved modestly. the firming
up of export growth should support manufacturing and service sector activity. if the
recent pick-up in industrial activity is sustained in an environment conducive to the
revival of investment and unlocking of stalled projects, with ongoing fiscal
consolidation releasing resources for private enterprise, external demand picking up
and international crude prices stabilising, the central estimate of real gdp growth of
5.5 per cent within a likely range of 5 to 6 per cent that was set out in the april
projection for 2014-15 can be sustained. on the other hand, if risks relating to the
global recovery, the monsoon and geo-political tensions intensify, the balance of risks
could tilt to the downside (chart 2).

9.
the reserve bank will continue to monitor inflation developments closely, and
remains committed to the disinflationary path of taking cpi inflation to 8 per cent by
january 2015 and 6 per cent by january 2016. while inflation at around 8 per cent in
early 2015 seems likely, it is critical that the disinflationary process is sustained over
the medium-term. the balance of risks around the medium-term inflation path, and
especially the target of 6 per cent by january 2016, are still to the upside, warranting

4
a heightened state of policy preparedness to contain these risks if they materialise. in
the months ahead, government actions on food management and to facilitate project
completion should improve supply, but as consumer and business confidence pick
up, aggregate demand will also strengthen. the reserve bank will act as necessary
to ensure sustained disinflation.
10.
in the second bi-monthly monetary policy statement of june 2014, the
reserve bank reduced the slr to 22.5 per cent of ndtl in anticipation of recovery
in economic activity. with the union budget for 2014-15 renewing commitment to the
medium-term fiscal consolidation roadmap and budgeting 4.1 per cent of gdp as the
fiscal deficit for the year, space has opened up further for banks to expand credit to
the productive sectors in response to its financing needs as growth picks up.
accordingly, the slr is reduced by a further 0.5 per cent of ndtl.
11.
in consonance with the calibrated reduction in the slr, it is necessary to
enhance liquidity in the money and debt markets so that financial intermediation
expands apace with a growing economy. currently, banks are permitted to exceed
the limit of 25 per cent of total investments under the held to maturity (htm) category
provided the excess comprises only slr securities, and banks’ total holdings of slr
securities in the htm category is not more than 24.5 per cent of their ndtl as on
the last friday of the second preceding fortnight. in order to enable banks greater
participation in financial markets, this ceiling is being brought down to 24 per cent of
ndtl with effect from the fortnight beginning august 9, 2014.
12.
the reserve bank has taken a number of steps to enhance efficiency,
increase entry, speed up resolution, and improve access to financial services, such
as modified regulations on long term lending and borrowing, proposals for licensing
payment banks and small banks, a framework to deal with stressed assets, actions to
further the use of mobile phones in banking, and efforts to simplify know your
customer (kyc) norms, among others. the reserve bank will continue to carry
forward its banking sector reforms agenda.
13.
the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement is scheduled on tuesday,
september 30, 2014.
