sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement, 2016-17
resolution of the monetary policy committee (mpc), reserve bank of india
on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at
its meeting today, the monetary policy committee (mpc) decided to:
• keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (laf) unchanged at
6.25 per cent.
consequently, the reverse repo rate under the laf remains unchanged at 5.75 per
cent, and the marginal standing facility (msf) rate and the bank rate at 6.75 per cent.
the decision of the mpc is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in
consonance with the objective of achieving consumer price index (cpi) inflation at 5 per cent
by q4 of 2016-17 and the medium-term target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent,
while supporting growth. the main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the
statement below.
assessment
2.
global growth is projected to pick up modestly in 2017, after slowing down in the
year gone by. advanced economies (aes) are expected to build upon the slow gathering of
momentum that started in the second half of 2016, led by the us and japan. however,
uncertainty surrounds the direction of us macroeconomic policies with potential global
spillovers. growth prospects for emerging market economies (emes) are also expected to
improve moderately, with recessionary conditions ebbing in russia and brazil, and china
stabilising on policy stimulus. inflation is edging up on the back of rising energy prices and a
mild firming up of demand. however, global trade remains subdued due to an increasing
tendency towards protectionist policies and heightened political tensions. furthermore,
financial conditions are likely to tighten as central banks in aes normalise exceptional
accommodation in monetary policy.

3.
international financial markets turned volatile from mid-january on concerns
regarding the ‘brexit’ roadmap and materialisation of expectations about economic policies
of the new us administration. within the rising profile of international commodity prices,
crude oil prices firmed up with the opec’s agreement to curtail production. prices of base
metals have also increased on expectations of fiscal stimulus in the us, strong infrastructure
spending in china, and supply reductions. geopolitical concerns have also hardened
commodity prices. more recently, the appetite for risk has returned in aes, buoying equity
markets and hardening bond yields as a response to the growing likelihood of further
increases in the federal funds rate during the year. coupled with expectations of fiscal
expansion in the us, this has propelled the us dollar to a multi-year high.
4.
the central statistics office (cso) released its advance estimates for 2016-17 on
january 6, placing india’s real gva growth at 7.0 per cent for the year, down from 7.8 per
cent (first revised estimates released on january 31) a year ago. agriculture and allied
activities posted a strong pick-up, benefiting from the normal south-west monsoon, robust
expansion in rabi acreage (higher by 5.7 per cent over the preceding year) and favourable
base effects as well as the continuing resilience of allied activities. in contrast, the industrial
sector experienced a sharp deceleration, mainly due to a slowdown in manufacturing and in
mining and quarrying. service sector activity also lost pace, concentrated in trade, hotels,
transport and communication services, and construction, cushioned to some extent by public
administration and defence.
5.
industrial output measured by the index of industrial production (iip) finally shrugged
off the debilitating drag from insulated rubber cables from november and was also pushed up
by a favourable base effect. in december, the output of core industries accelerated on a yearon-year as well as on a sequentially seasonally adjusted basis. the drivers of the upturn were
steel production and petroleum refinery throughput, the former, inter alia, supported by
import tariff safeguards and the latter buoyed by external demand. the acceleration in coal
production and thermal electricity generation since november after three consecutive months
of contraction augur well for the outlook for power. reflecting these developments, the
manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (pmi) returned to expansion mode in january on
the back of growth of new orders and output, and the future output index has risen strongly.
on the other hand, the 76th round of the reserve bank’s industrial outlook survey suggests
that financing conditions facing the manufacturing sector have worsened in q3 of 2016-17
and are expected to remain tight in q4. this is corroborated by the sharp slowdown in bank
credit to industry and continuing sluggishness in the investment climate in some sectors.
6.
high frequency indicators point to subdued activity in the services sector, particularly
automobile sales across all segments, domestic air cargo, railway freight traffic, and cement
production. nevertheless, some areas stand out as bright spots, having weathered the transient
effects of demonetisation – steel consumption; port traffic; international air freight; foreign
tourist arrivals; tractor sales; and, cellular telephone subscribers. the services pmi for
january 2017 remained in retrenchment, but the fall in output was the least in the current
phase of three consecutive months of contraction.
2

7.
marking the fifth consecutive month of softening, retail inflation measured by the
headline consumer price index (cpi) turned down sharper than expected in december and
reached its lowest reading since november 2014. this outcome was driven by deflation in
the prices of vegetables and pulses. some moderation in the rate of increase in prices of
protein-rich items – eggs, meat and fish – also aided the downturn in food inflation.
8.
excluding food and fuel, inflation has been unyielding at 4.9 per cent since
september. while some part of this inertial behaviour is attributable to the turnaround in
international crude prices since october – which fed into prices of petrol and diesel embedded
in transport and communication – a broad-based stickiness is discernible in inflation,
particularly in housing, health, education, personal care and effects (excluding gold and silver)
as well as miscellaneous goods and services consumed by households.
9.
the large overhang of liquidity consequent upon demonetisation weighed on money
markets in december, but from mid-january rebalancing has been underway with expansion
of currency in circulation and new bank notes being injected into the system at an accelerated
pace. throughout this period, the reserve bank’s market operations have been in liquidity
absorption mode. with the abolition of the incremental cash reserve ratio from december 10,
liquidity management operations have consisted of variable rate reverse repos under the laf
of tenors ranging from overnight to 91 days and auctions of cash management bills under the
market stabilisation scheme (mss) of tenors ranging from 14 to 63 days. the average daily
net absorption under the laf was ` 1.6 trillion in december, ` 2.0 trillion in january and `
3.7 trillion in february (up to february 7) while under the mss, it was ` 3.8 trillion, ` 5.0
trillion and ` 2.9 trillion, respectively. money market rates remained aligned with the policy
repo rate albeit with a soft bias, with the weighted average call money rate (wacr) averaging
18 basis points below the policy rate during december and january.
10.
turning to the external sector, export growth remained in the positive zone for the
fourth month in succession in december. imports other than petroleum oil and lubricants
(pol) came out of the spike in november and moderated in december. in contrast, there was
an increase of over 10 per cent in pol imports, in part reflecting the rise in international crude
oil prices. overall, the trade deficit shrank both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis, being
lower for the period april-december by us$ 23.5 billion than its level a year ago. on the
whole, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted and below 1 per cent of gdp in
2016-17. while the buoyancy in net foreign direct investment was sustained, there have been
portfolio outflows beginning october on uncertainty relating to the direction of us
macroeconomic policies and expectations of faster normalisation of us monetary policy in the
year ahead. foreign exchange reserves were at us$ 363.1 billion on february 3, 2017.
outlook
11.
in the fifth bi-monthly statement of december, headline inflation was projected at 5
per cent in q4 of 2016-17 with risks lower than before but still tilted to the upside. the decline
in headline cpi inflation in november and december has been larger than expected, but
almost exclusively on the back of deflation in vegetables and pulses. while the seasonal ebb in
3

the prices of vegetables that usually occurs with the onset of winter as well as some demand
compression may have contributed to this outcome, anecdotal evidence points to some distress
sales of perishables having accentuated the decline in vegetable prices, with spillovers into
january as well. looking beyond, prices of pulses are likely to remain soft with comfortable
supply conditions, while vegetable prices may potentially rebound as the effects of
demonetisation wear off.
12.
the committee is of the view that the persistence of inflation excluding food and fuel
could set a floor on further downward movements in headline inflation and trigger secondorder effects. nevertheless, headline cpi inflation in q4 of 2016-17 is likely to be below 5 per
cent. favourable base effects and lagged effects of demand compression may mute headline
inflation in q1 of 2017-18. thereafter, it is expected to pick up momentum, especially as
growth picks up and the output gap narrows. moreover, base effects will reverse and turn
adverse during q3 and q4 of 2017-18. accordingly, inflation is projected in the range of 4.0
to 4.5 per cent in the first half of the financial year and in the range of 4.5 to 5.0 per cent in the
second half with risks evenly balanced around this projected path (chart 1). in this context, it
is important to note three significant upside risks that impart some uncertainty to the baseline
inflation path – the hardening profile of international crude prices; volatility in the exchange
rate on account of global financial market developments, which could impart upside pressures
to domestic inflation; and the fuller effects of the house rent allowances under the 7th central
pay commission (cpc) award which have not been factored in the baseline inflation path.
the focus of the union budget on growth revival without compromising on fiscal prudence
should bode well for limiting upside risks to inflation.
13.
gva growth for 2016-17 is projected at 6.9 per cent with risks evenly balanced
around it. growth is expected to recover sharply in 2017-18 on account of several factors.
first, discretionary consumer demand held back by demonetisation is expected to bounce back
beginning in the closing months of 2016-17. second, economic activity in cash-intensive
sectors such as retail trade, hotels and restaurants, and transportation, as well as in the
unorganised sector, is expected to be rapidly restored. third, demonetisation-induced ease in
bank funding conditions has led to a sharp improvement in transmission of past policy rate
reductions into marginal cost-based lending rates (mclrs), and in turn, to lending rates for
healthy borrowers, which should spur a pick-up in both consumption and investment demand.
fourth, the emphasis in the union budget for 2017-18 on stepping up capital expenditure, and
boosting the rural economy and affordable housing should contribute to growth. accordingly,
gva growth for 2017-18 is projected at 7.4 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (chart 2).

14.
the committee remains committed to bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per
cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner. this requires further significant decline in
inflation expectations, especially since the services component of inflation that is sensitive to
wage movements has been sticky. the committee decided to change the stance from
accommodative to neutral while keeping the policy rate on hold to assess how the transitory
effects of demonetisation on inflation and the output gap play out.
15.
the reserve bank has conducted market liquidity operations consistent with the
liquidity management framework put in place in april 2016, progressively moving the system
level ex ante liquidity conditions to close to neutrality. this stance will continue. surplus
liquidity should decline with progressive remonetisation. nonetheless, the currently abundant
liquidity with banks is likely to persist into the early months of 2017-18. the reserve bank is
committed to ensuring efficient and appropriate liquidity management with all the instruments
at its command to ensure close alignment of the wacr with the policy rate, improved
transmission of policy impulses to lending rates, and adequate flow of credit to productive
sectors of the economy.
16.
the committee believes that the environment for timely transmission of policy rates
to banks lending rates will be considerably improved if (i) the banking sector’s nonperforming assets (npas) are resolved more quickly and efficiently; (ii) recapitalisation of the
banking sector is hastened; and, (iii) the formula for adjustments in the interest rates on small
savings schemes to changes in yields on government securities of corresponding maturity is
fully implemented. 1
1

since the introduction of the formula in april 2016, interest rates on small savings are about 65-100 basis points higher, depending on
tenor, compared to what they should be if the formula is followed. if the spread between small savings rates and bond yields remains wide,
the diversion of deposits to small savings would impede a full transmission to bank lending rates.
