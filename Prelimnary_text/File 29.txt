annual policy statement 2009-10
by
dr. d. subbarao
governor
this annual policy statement for
2009-10 is set in the context of
exceptionally challenging circumstances in
the global economy. the crisis has called
into question several fundamental
assumptions and beliefs governing
economic resilience and financial stability.
what started off as turmoil in the financial
sector of the advanced economies has
snowballed into the deepest and most
widespread financial and economic crisis
of the last 60 years. with all the advanced
economies in a synchronised recession,
global gdp is projected to contract for the
first time since the world war ii, anywhere
between 0.5 and 1.0 per cent, according to
the march 2009 forecast of the international
monetary fund (imf). the world trade
organisation (wto) has forecast that
global trade volume will contract by 9.0 per
cent in 2009.
2.
governments and central banks
around the world have responded to the
crisis through both conventional and
unconventional fiscal and monetary
measures. these measures have been
criticised for their size, timing, sequencing
and design as also, more importantly, for
their economic and ideological
underpinnings. the most voluble criticism
has been that ‘purely national responses’
are inadequate to address a virulent global

crisis. in recognition of a pressing need
for global co-ordination and co-operation,
particularly in order to inspire the trust and
confidence of economic agents around the
world, leaders of the g-20 group of nations
met twice in the last six months. at their
recent meeting in early april 2009, the
g-20 leaders collectively committed to take
decisive, co-ordinated and comprehensive
actions to revive growth, restore stability
of the financial system, restart the impaired
credit markets and rebuild confidence in
financial markets and institutions.
3.
despite some apprehensions prior
to the meeting, the overall impact of the
g-20 meeting in managing market
perceptions has been positive. even so, the
global financial situation remains uncertain
and the global economy continues to cause
anxiety for several reasons. there is as yet
no clear estimate of the quantum of tainted
assets, and doubts persist on whether the
initiatives underway are sufficient to restore
the stability of the financial system. there
is continued debate on the adequacy of the
fiscal stimulus packages across countries,
and their effectiveness in arresting the
downturn, reversing job losses and reviving
consumer confidence. many major central
banks have nearly or totally exhausted their
conventional weaponry of calibrating
policy interest rates and are now resorting

restaurants sub-sectors. for the first time
in seven years, exports have declined in
absolute terms for five months in a row
during october 2008-february 2009.
recent data indicate that the demand for
bank credit is slackening despite
comfortable liquidity in the system.
dampened demand has dented corporate
margins while the uncertainty surrounding
the crisis has affected business confidence.
the index of industrial production (iip) has
been nearly stagnant in the last five months
(october 2008 to february 2009), of which
two months registered negative growth.
investment demand has also decelerated.
all these indicators suggest that growth will
moderate more than what had been
expected earlier.

to unconventional measures such as
quantitative and credit easing. given the
erosion of the monetary policy transmission
mechanism, there are concerns about when
and to what extent monetary response,
admittedly aggressive, will begin to have
an impact on reviving credit flows and
spurring aggregate demand.
4.
like all emerging economies,
india too has been impacted by the crisis,
and by much more than what was
expected earlier. the extent of impact has
caused dismay, mainly on two grounds:
first, because our financial sector remains
healthy, has had no direct exposure to
tainted assets and its off-balance sheet
activities have been limited; and second,
because india’s merchandise exports, at
less than 15 per cent of gdp, are relatively
modest. despite these mitigating factors,
the impact of the crisis on india evidences
the force of globalisation as also india’s
growing two-way trade in goods and
services and financial integration with the
rest of the world.

6.
despite the adverse impact as
noted above, there are several comforting
factors that have helped india weather the
crisis. first, our financial markets,
particularly our banks, have continued to
function normally. second, india’s
comfortable foreign exchange reserves
provide confidence in our ability to manage
our balance of payments notwithstanding
lower export demand and dampened
capital flows. third, headline inflation,
as measured by the wholesale price index
(wpi), has declined sharply. consumer
price inflation too has begun to moderate.
fourth, because of mandated agricultural
lending and social safety-net programmes,
rural demand continues to be robust.

5.
after clocking annual growth of 8.9
per cent on an average over the last five
years (2003-08), india was headed for a
cyclical downturn in 2008-09. but the
growth moderation has been much sharper
because of the negative impact of the crisis.
in fact, in the first two quarters of 2008-09,
the growth slowdown was quite modest; the
full impact of the crisis began to be felt
post-lehman in the third quarter, which
recorded a sharp downturn in growth. the
services sector, which has been our prime
growth engine for the last five years, is
slowing, mainly in construction, transport
and communication, trade, hotels and

7.
both the government and the
reserve bank responded to the challenge
of minimising the impact of crisis on india
in co-ordination and consultation. the
reserve bank shifted its policy stance from
2

sixth pay commission report, all of which
too added to stimulating demand.

monetary tightening in response to the
elevated inflationary pressures in the first
half of 2008-09 to monetary easing in
response to easing inflationary pressures
and moderation of growth engendered by
the crisis. the reserve bank’s policy
response was aimed at containing the
contagion from the global financial crisis
while maintaining comfortable domestic
and forex liquidity. taking a cue from the
reserve bank’s monetary easing, most
banks have reduced their deposit and
lending rates.

9.
this annual policy statement for
2009-10 is organised in two parts. part a
covers monetary policy which provides an
assessment of the macroeconomic and
monetary developments (section i), the
stance of monetary policy (section ii) and
monetary measures (section iii). part b on
developmental and regulatory policies
covers financial stability (section i),
interest rate policy (section ii), financial
markets (section iii), credit delivery
mechanism and other banking services
(section iv), prudential measures
(section v) and institutional developments
(section vi). this statement should be read
and understood together with the analytical
review of macroeconomic and monetary
developments released yesterday.

8.
the central government launched
three fiscal stimulus packages during
december 2008-february 2009. these
stimulus packages came on top of an
already announced expanded safety-net
programme for the rural poor, the farm loan
waiver package and payout following the

part a. monetary policy statement 2009-10
i. macroeconomic and monetary developments
global outlook

economic activity has declined sharply,
driven mainly by the decline in consumption
and exports. the euro area too is in a severe
and synchronised contraction. reflecting
sharp demand contraction, consumer price
inflation has reached near zero in several
advanced countries, raising concerns about
sustained deflation on the way forward. the
unemployment rate in the us has risen to
8.5 per cent, the highest since 1983.
unemployment rates in the euro area, the
uk and japan too increased significantly.
the wto projects that global trade will
shrink by 9.0 per cent in volume terms in

10.
the global outlook has continued
to deteriorate in the last quarter with
projections for global growth in 2009
undergoing rapid downward revision.
according to the imf’s march 2009
forecast, global growth is projected to
shrink by 0.5 to 1.0 per cent in 2009 in
contrast to an expansion of 3.2 per cent in
2008. other projections are even more dire.
the world bank estimates global gdp to
contract by 1.7 per cent and the oecd by
as much as 2.7 per cent. in the us,
3

positive contributions are expected from
china and india. the crisis spread from
advanced countries to emes, as is now
clear, through both trade and finance
channels. the slump in export demand and
tighter trade credit caused deceleration in
aggregate demand; reversal of capital flows
led to equity market losses and currency
depreciations; global liquidity tightening
resulted in lower external credit flows to
emes; and market rigidities and erosion of
confidence led to widening of credit
spreads. like advanced countries, emes
too responded to the challenge of managing
the crisis through fiscal and monetary
actions, but these measures will not have
full impact until the global situation stabilises
and trade and credit flows are restored. the
g-20 commitment to desist from all forms
of protectionism and to maintain open
trade and investment regimes is a source
of comfort to emes in an otherwise
discouraging external environment.

2009, down from an increase of 2.0 per cent
in 2008. between 1990 and 2007, global
trade grew twice as fast as global gdp; in
a sharp reversal of this ‘trade as the engine
of growth’ paradigm, in 2009 global trade
is projected to shrink twice as much as
global gdp.
11.
in advanced countries, substantial
injection of liquidity and successive cuts
in the policy rates have resulted in the
softening of short-term interest rates,
particularly in the overnight segment.
however, the transmission to the credit
market has been impaired, suggesting that
the process of deleveraging is incomplete,
asset prices have yet to stabilise and that
credit spreads need to narrow further. banks
and financial institutions are still in the
process of recognising losses arising out of
off-balance sheet exposures. this raises
concerns about the extent of required
recapitalisation, and this uncertainty is
inhibiting fresh lending. most importantly,
the global financial system is yet to recover
the forfeited trust and confidence. under
the g-20 initiative, efforts are underway to
strengthen the global financial architecture
and restore the global growth momentum
through co-ordinated actions.

domestic outlook
13.
economic activity in india slowed
down in q1 and q2 of 2008-09 as
compared with over 9.0 per cent growth
in the previous three years. however,
growth decelerated sharply in q3 following
t h e failure of lehman brothers in
mid-september 2008 and knock-on effects
of the global financial crisis on the indian
economy. consequently, the growth rate
during the first three quarters (aprildecember) of 2008-09 slowed down
significantly to 6.9 per cent from 9.0 per
cent in the corresponding period of the
previous year (table 1). the advance
estimates of the central statistical
organisation (cso) released in february

12.
the imf projects that the gdp
growth of emes will decelerate to a range
of 1.5-2.5 per cent in 2009, down from 6.1
per cent in 2008. this downturn is clear
evidence that the forces of globalisation are
too strong for the decoupling hypothesis to
work. even across emes, there are wide
variations: several countries are likely to
post negative growth, while significant

tonnes, lower than the production of 230.8
million tonnes in the previous year.
subsequent information on good sowing for
rabi crops and the trend in procurement
suggests that agricultural production during
2008-09 may turn out to be better than
earlier anticipated.

2009 have placed the real gdp growth for
2008-09 at 7.1 per cent.
14.
the last annual policy statement
of the reserve bank released in april 2008
placed real gdp growth for 2008-09 in the
range of 8.0-8.5 per cent. around that
time, the imf had projected the global
growth to be at 3.7 per cent in 2008. as the
year progressed and the crisis unfolded,
economic prospects globally deteriorated
rapidly and at home in india in q3
2008-09. beginning july 2008, the imf
made frequent reductions in its growth
forecasts for 2008. the reserve bank too
reflected the deteriorating outlook by
revising downward its growth projection for
india for 2008-09 to 7.5-8.0 per cent in the
mid-term review (october 2008) and
further down to 7.0 per cent with a
downward bias in the third quarter review
(january 2009). the downside risks have
since materialised and the gdp growth for
2008-09 is now projected to turn out to be
in the range of 6.5 to 6.7 per cent.

industry
16.
during 2008-09 so far (aprilfebruary), industrial growth based on the
index of industrial production (iip),
decelerated to 2.8 per cent, down by more
than two-third from 8.8 per cent in the
corresponding period of the previous year.
while iip growth was 5.0 per cent in the
first half of 2008-09, the average growth in
the following five months was insignificant
(0.2 per cent). there, however, have been
some incipient positive signs. although the
iip contracted by 1.2 per cent in february
2009, machinery and equipment (other than
transport equipment) exhibited double digit
growth. in terms of use-based classification,
capital goods production too registered
double digit growth.

agriculture

the ministry of agriculture released in
february 2009 have placed total foodgrains

quarter of 2008-09. in the second quarter,
net profits declined, although gross
profits continued to increase, albeit
marginally. in the third quarter, even
gross profits declined sharply (table 3).
profit margins were eroded by higher
input costs, increased interest outgo,
significant drop in non-sales income and
losses on foreign currency related
transactions. while moderation in
internal accruals has an adverse effect on
corporate investment, decline in input
prices and reduction in borrowing costs
may have a favourable impact on
profitability going forward.

q3 of 2008-09. government consumption
demand, however, registered a sharp
increase, reflecting the partial payout of
the sixth pay commission award and
other fiscal stimulus measures. as a
result, the share of government
consumption demand in gdp increased
significantly. deceleration in net exports
growth in the successive quarters of
2008-09 had an adverse impact on the
overall gdp growth (table 2).
corporate performance
18.
after registering robust growth
during the five year period 2003-08, the
performance of the private non-financial
corporate sector deteriorated in the first
three quarters of 2008-09. sales growth
of companies, which continued to be
strong in q1 and q2, decelerated sharply
in q3 of 2008-09. net profits, which
recorded an average annual growth of
over 40 per cent during 2003-08, recorded
a significantly lower growth in the first

to the fall in wpi inflation since august
2008, mineral oils and basic metals
(combined weight 15.3 per cent in wpi)
together accounted for over 83 per cent of
the decline reflecting global trend in
commodity prices. the prices of food
articles, however, are still ruling high. the
inflation based on various consumer price
indices (cpis) continues to be near doubledigit level mainly reflecting a firm trend
in prices of food articles (table 4). wpi
inflation declined further to 0.18 per cent
as on april 4, 2009.

business confidence
19.
the industrial outlook survey of
the reserve bank for january-march 2009
indicates a further worsening of perception
for the indian manufacturing sector. the
overall business and financial sentiment,
which touched a seven-year low in the
preceding quarter, slid below the neutral 100
mark, for the first time since the compilation
of the index began in 2002. according to
the survey, the demand for working capital
finance during january-march 2009 from
external sources dropped due to slowdown
in business, even as the availability of
finance eased. the business confidence
surveys conducted by other agencies are
also consistent with these findings.

22.
the analysis of the last four years
suggests that wpi inflation and cpi
inflation moved, by and large, in tandem
till april 2007. thereafter, inflation
measured in wpi and cpi tended to
diverge. however, the divergence in the
recent period has been unusually high
reflecting the volatilities in commodity
prices which have a higher weight in wpi
(chart 1). with the decline in wpi inflation,
cpi inflation is expected to moderate in the
coming months. for its overall assessment
of inflation outlook for policy purposes, the
reserve bank continuously monitors the
full array of price indicators.

lead indicators
20.
in terms of lead indicators of the
economy, economic activity in several
services sectors has been moderating. cargo
handled at major ports, passengers handled
at airports, railway freight traffic and
arrival of foreign tourists registered lower/
negative growth. strong rural demand,
lagged impact of monetary and fiscal
stimuli, softening of domestic input prices,
investment demand from brown-field
projects and some restructuring initiatives
are expected to have a positive impact on
industrial production in the months ahead.

fiscal scenario
23.
the finances of the central
government in 2008-09 deviated
significantly from the budget estimates
(be). higher revenue expenditure together
with lower revenue receipts led to a sharp
increase in the revenue and fiscal deficits.
the deviation of deficit indicators from the
targets stipulated under the fiscal
responsibility and budget management
(frbm) rules was on account of several

need to adjust the fiscal policy to take care
of exceptional circumstances through
which the economy is passing, the fiscal
consolidation process has to be put on hold
temporarily. the process of fiscal
consolidation should resume once there is
an improvement in economic conditions.

october-december 2008. the total revenue
loss due to tax reductions amounted to
rs.8,700 crore (0.2 per cent of gdp) in
2008-09 and rs.28,100 crore (0.5 per cent
of gdp) in 2009-10. the additional
stimulus measures during 2008-09 work out
to about 2.9 per cent of gdp. furthermore,
the revenue collection was adversely
impacted by the economic slowdown.
consequently, the interim budget for
2009-10 revised the estimates for 2008-09
– revenue deficit to 4.4 per cent and the
fiscal deficit to 6.0 per cent of gdp as
against the budget estimates of 1.0 per cent
and 2.5 per cent respectively. in addition,
special bonds amounting to 1.8 per cent of
gdp were issued to oil marketing companies
and fertiliser companies during 2008-09.

31.
currently available information
indicates that the consolidated budgeted
revenue surplus of the states in 2008-09
may not materialise. consequently, the
consolidated fiscal deficit of the states is
expected to rise to around 3.0 per cent of
gdp. the combined fiscal deficit of the
central and state governments during
2008-09 would be about 9.0 per cent of
gdp. accounting for special securities
issued by the central government outside
the market borrowing programme, the
combined fiscal deficit works out to about
10.8 per cent of gdp. while some of the
increase in the revenue and fiscal deficits
is on account of post-budget expenditure
commitments such as payment of arrears
resulting from the sixth pay commission

30.
as per the interim budget 2009-10,
the revenue deficit and the fiscal deficit are
projected to decline only moderately to 4.0
per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively during
2009-10. the government in its
macroeconomic framework statement,
indicated that in view of the compelling

inter-related effects on reserve money.
first, it reduces reserve money as bankers’
required cash deposits with the reserve
bank fall. second, the money multiplier
rises. third, with the increase in the money
multiplier, m3 expands with a lag. while
the initial expansionary effect is strong,
the full effect is felt in 4-6 months.
reflecting these changes, the year-on-year
increase in reserve money in 2008-09 was
much lower than in the previous year.
however, adjusted for the first round effect
of crr reduction, deceleration in reserve
money growth was less pronounced. the
annual m 3 growth in 2008-09, though
lower compared with the previous year,
was also below the trajectory projected
in the third quarter review of january
2009 (table 10).

award, a substantial increase is also due to
the economic downturn arising from the
impact of the global financial crisis.
although the fiscal stimulus packages have
meant deviation from the roadmap laid out
by the frbm act, reversing the
consolidation process of the last several
years, they were warranted under the
prevailing circumstances. it is critically
important, however, that the centre and
states re-anchor to a revised frbm
mandate once the immediacy of the crisis
is behind us.
monetary conditions
32.
growth in key monetary aggregates
– reserve money (rm) and money supply
(m3) – in 2008-09 reflected the changing
liquidity positions arising from domestic
and global financial conditions and the
monetary policy response. reserve money
variations during 2008-09 largely reflected
the increase in the currency in circulation
and reduction in the cash reserve ratio
(crr) of banks.

34.
monetary management during
2008-09 was dominated by the response to
the spillover effects of global financial
crisis and the need to address slackening
of domestic demand conditions, especially
during the third quarter. as the reserve
bank had to provide foreign exchange
liquidity to meet the demand from

expansion was lower than that of 23.0
per cent in 2007-08 as also the indicative
projection of 24.0 per cent set in the third
quarter review of january 2009. the
intra-year changes in credit flow could be
attributed to several factors. first, the
demand for bank credit increased sharply
during april-october 2008 as corporates
found that their external sources of credit
had dried up, and shifted that demand to
domestic credit. second, there was a sharp
increase in credit to oil marketing
companies by rs.36,208 crore during apriloctober 2008 as compared with a decline
of rs.1,146 crore in the corresponding
period of the previous year. in the
subsequent period, however, the demand
for credit moderated reflecting the
slowdown of the economy in general and
the industrial sector in particular. working
capital requirements had also come down
because of decline in commodity prices and
drawdown of inventories by the corporates.
the demand for credit by oil marketing
companies also moderated. in addition,
substantially lower credit expansion by
private and foreign banks also muted the
overall flow of bank credit during the year
(table 11).

importers and contain volatility in the
foreign exchange market arising out of
capital outflows by foreign institutional
investors (fiis), its net foreign exchange
assets (nfea) declined. this had an overall
contractionary effect on rupee liquidity. the
reserve bank addressed this issue by
providing rupee liquidity through
expansion of net domestic assets (nda) by
(i) conventional open market operations;
(ii) special 14-day term repo facility for
banks; (iii) buy-back of securities held
under the market stabilisation scheme;
(iv) special market operations, including the
purchase of oil bonds; (v) enlargement of
export credit refinance window; (vi) special
refinance facility for banks for addressing
the liquidity concerns of nbfcs, mutual
funds and housing finance companies;
(vii) special refinance facility for financial
institutions (sidbi, nhb and exim bank);
and (viii) funding to nbfcs through a
special purpose vehicle (spv). thus, a
notable feature of monetary operations
during the second half of 2008-09 was the
substitution of foreign assets by domestic
assets. consequently, liquidity conditions
have remained comfortable since
mid-november 2008 as reflected in the
laf window being generally in the
absorption mode and the call/notice rate
remaining near or below the lower bound
of the laf corridor consistent with the
stance of monetary policy.

36.
commercial banks’ investment
in slr securities, adjusted for laf,
declined marginally from 28.4 per cent of
ndtl in march 2008 to 26.7 per cent in
march 2009.
37.
according to the data at a
disaggregated level drawn from 49 banks
accounting for 95.0 per cent of total bank
credit, the year-on-year growth in bank
credit to industry as of february 2009 was
broadly similar to that in the previous year.

has reduced its lending rate (repo rate) by
400 basis points, most banks have lowered
their lending rate in the range of 50-150
basis points.

the government hardens interest rate
expectations. from the real economy
perspective, however, for monetary
policy to have demand-inducing effects,
lending rates will have to come down.

45.
the adjustment in market interest
rates in response to changes in policy
rates gets reflected with some lag.
however, the transmission to the credit
market is somewhat slow on account of
several structural rigidities. in this
context, banks have brought out the
following constraints in their discussions
with the reserve bank. first, the
administered interest rate structure of
small savings acts as a floor to deposit
interest rates. without reduction in
deposit rates, banks find it difficult to
reduce lending rates exclusively on policy
cues. second, while banks are allowed to
offer ‘variable’ interest rates on longerterm deposits, depositors have a distinct
preference for fixed interest rates on such
deposits which results in an asymmetric
contractual relationship. in a rising
interest rate scenario, while depositors
retain the flexibility to prematurely
withdraw their existing deposits and
re-deploy the same at higher interest
rates, banks have to necessarily carry
these high cost deposits till their maturity
in the downturn of the interest rate cycle.
third, during periods of credit boom as
in 2004-07, competition among banks for
wholesale deposits often hardens deposit
interest rates, thereby further increasing
the cost of funds. fourth, the linkage of
concessional administered lending rates,
such as for agriculture and exports, to
banks’ bplrs makes overall lending
rates less flexible. fifth, the persistence
of large volumes of market borrowing by

46.
the changes in bplr do not
fully reflect the changes in the effective
lending rates. during the pre-policy
consultations with the reserve bank,
banks pointed out that lending rates
should not be assessed only in terms of
reduction in bplrs since as much as
three-quarters of lending is at rates below
bplr which includes lending to
agriculture, export sector, and well-rated
companies, including psus. the
weighted average lending rate, which was
11.9 per cent in 2006-07, increased to
12.3 per cent (provisional) in 2007-08.
according to the information collected
from select banks, the average yield on
advances, a proxy measure of effective
lending rate, in 2008-09 was around 10.9
per cent. as most of the commercial
banks have cut their bplrs in the second
half of 2008-09, the effective lending rate
towards the end of 2008-09 could be
even lower than 10.9 per cent.
nevertheless, it may be noted that
current deposit and lending rates are
now higher than in 2004-2007, although
the policy rates are now lower than in that
period. this is reflective of the hysteresis
in the system. reduction in public sector
banks deposit rates in 1-3 year maturity
from 9.50-10.75 per cent in october 2008
to 7.00-8.75 per cent by april 2009 has
not been commensurate with the
moderation in inflation. judging from
the experience of 2004-07, deposit rates
can be lower and should come down.
18

on december 30, 2008, it then generally
increased in the wake of the large market
borrowing programme of the government,
reaching 7.08 per cent on march 30, 2009.
the yield has subsequently declined on
account of substantial easing of liquidity
and reduction in inflation.

47.
notwithstanding the above
factors, there is still a scope for banks to
reduce their lending rates. pointing to the
current wpi inflation rate near zero, some
have argued that real lending rates are very
high. the point-to-point variations in wpi
exaggerate the level of real interest rate
due to divergence between various price
indices as also the inflation expectations.
notwithstanding computational challenges,
even when inflation is taken as 4.0-4.5
per cent based on the underlying trend, real
lending rates would still appear to be high.
banks, therefore, must strive to reduce
their lending rates further.
financial markets

49.
during 2008-09, the rupee, with
significant intra-year variation, generally
depreciated against major currencies
except pound sterling on account of
widening of trade and current account
deficits as well as capital outflows. during
the current fiscal year (up to april 17,
2009), the rupee has generally remained
steady (chart 2).

48.
since october 2008, interest rates
have declined across the term structure in
the money and government securities
markets (table 19). the call/notice rates
have remained near or below the lower
bound of the laf corridor from november
2008. while the secondary market yield
on the 10-year government security
touched an intra-year low of 5.11 per cent

50.
during 2008-09, equity markets
weakened in tandem with global stock
markets, reflecting general deterioration in
sentiment, fii outflows, slowdown in
industrial growth and lower corporate
profits. the bse sensex declined to 8160
on march 9, 2009 from a peak of 20873
recorded on january 8, 2008; it closed
higher at 11023 on april 17, 2009.

ii. stance of monetary policy
53.
the policy responses in india
since september 2008 have been designed
largely to mitigate the adverse impact of
the global financial crisis on the indian
economy. the conduct of monetary policy
had to contend with the high speed and
magnitude of the external shock and its
spill-over effects through the real,
financial and confidence channels. the
evolving stance of policy has been
increasingly conditioned by the need to
preserve financial stability while arresting
the moderation in the growth momentum.

rupee liquidity

54.
the thrust of the various policy
initiatives by the reserve bank has been on
providing ample rupee liquidity, ensuring
comfortable dollar liquidity and maintaining
a market environment conducive for the
continued flow of credit to productive
sectors. the key policy initiatives taken by
the reserve bank since september 2008 are
set out below:
policy rates

•

•

the policy repo rate under the
liquidity adjustment facility (laf)
was reduced by 400 basis points from
9.0 per cent to 5.0 per cent.

•

the cash reserve ratio (crr) was
reduced by 400 basis points from 9.0
per cent of net demand and time
liabilities (ndtl) of banks to 5.0 per
cent.

•

the statutory liquidity ratio (slr) was
reduced from 25.0 per cent of ndtl
to 24.0 per cent.

•

the export credit refinance limit for
commercial banks was enhanced to
50.0 per cent from 15.0 per cent of
outstanding export credit.

•

a special 14-day term repo facility
was instituted for commercial banks
up to 1.5 per cent of ndtl.

•

a special refinance facility was
instituted for scheduled commercial
banks (excluding rrbs) up to 1.0 per
cent of each bank’s ndtl as on
october 24, 2008.

•

special refinance facilities were
instituted for financial institutions
(sidbi, nhb and exim bank).

forex liquidity

•

the policy reverse repo rate under
the laf was reduced by 250 basis
points from 6.0 per cent to 3.5
per cent.
21

the reserve bank sold foreign
exchange (us dollars) and made
available a forex swap facility to
banks.

•

the interest rate ceilings on nonresident indian (nri) deposits were
raised.

•

the all-in-cost ceiling for the external
commercial borrowings (ecbs) was
raised. the all-in-cost ceiling for
ecbs through the approval route
has been dispensed with up to june
30, 2009.

•

since september 2008 is set out in
annex i.
liquidity impact
56.
the actions of the reserve bank
since mid-september 2008 have resulted
in augmentation of actual/potential
liquidity of over rs.4,22,000 crore. in
addition, the permanent reduction in the
slr by 1.0 per cent of ndtl has made
available liquid funds of the order of
rs.40,000 crore for the purpose of credit
expansion (table 21).

the systemically important
non-deposit taking non-banking
financial companies (nbfcs-nd-si)
were permitted to raise short-term
foreign currency borrowings.

57.
the liquidity situation has
improved significantly following the
measures taken by the reserve bank. the
overnight money market rates, which
generally hovered above the repo rate
during september-october 2008, have
softened considerably and have generally
been close to or near the lower bound of
the laf corridor since early november
2008. other money market rates such as

most parts of the world. this is also
reflected in the domestic wpi inflation
reaching close to zero. prices of
manufactured products have decelerated
sharply, while that of the fuel group have
contracted, though inflation on account of
food articles still remains high. keeping
in view the global trend in commodity
prices and domestic demand-supply
balance, wpi inflation is projected at
around 4.0 per cent by end-march 2010.

stability. the availability of multiple
instruments and flexible use of these
instruments in the implementation of
monetary policy has enabled the reserve
bank to modulate the liquidity and interest
rate conditions amidst uncertain global
macroeconomic conditions.
growth projection
59.
the india meteorological
department in its forecast of south-west
monsoon expects a normal rainfall at 96
per cent of its long period average for the
current year. the fiscal and monetary
stimulus measures initiated during
2008-09 coupled with lower commodity
prices could cushion the downturn in the
growth momentum during 2009-10 by
stabilising domestic economic activity to
some extent. however, any upturn in the
growth momentum is unlikely in view of
the projected contraction in global
demand during 2009, particularly decline
in trade. while domestic financing
conditions have improved, external
financing conditions are expected to
remain tight. private investment demand
is, therefore, expected to remain subdued.
on balance, with the assumption of
normal monsoon, for policy purpose, real
gdp growth for 2009-10 is placed at
around 6.0 per cent.

61.
the wpi inflation, however, is
expected to be in the negative territory in
the early part of 2009-10. however, this
should not be interpreted as deflation for
policy purposes. this expected negative
inflation in india has only statistical
significance and is not a reflection of
demand contraction as is the case in
advanced economies. this transitory wpi
inflation in negative zone may not persist
beyond the middle of 2009-10. the
consumer price inflation as reflected in
various indices is expected to moderate
from its present high level but would
continue to remain in positive territory
through 2009-10 unlike wpi inflation.
moreover, it may also be noted that the
sharp decline in wpi inflation has not been
commensurately matched by a similar
decline in inflation expectations.
62.
it would be the endeavour of the
reserve bank to ensure price stability
and anchor inflation expectations.
towards this objective, the reserve bank
will, as always, continue to take into
account the behaviour of all the price
indices and their components. the
conduct of monetary policy would
continue to condition and contain

inflation projection
60.
on account of slump in global
demand, pressures on global commodity
prices have abated markedly around the
world. the sharp decline in prices of crude
oil, metals, foodgrains, cotton and cement
has influenced inflation expectations in
24

overall assessment

perception of inflation in the range of
4.0-4.5 per cent so that an inflation rate
of around 3.0 per cent becomes the
medium-term objective, consistent with
india’s broader integration into the global
economy and with the goal of
maintaining self-accelerating growth
over the medium-term.

64.
the global financial and economic
outlook continues to be unsettled and
uncertain. the latest assessment by major
international agencies projecting sharp
contraction in global trade volumes in
2009 has exacerbated the uncertainty. the
current assessments project little chance
of global economic recovery in 2009.
despite large scale recapitalisation,
write-offs and asset substitutions, sizeable
chunks of assets of systemically important
banks and financial institutions remain
impaired. it is also not clear if the
deleveraging process is complete. in such
a scenario, external financing conditions
for emerging market economies may
continue to remain tight and constrain their
growth prospects.

monetary projection
63.
monetary and credit aggregates
have witnessed deceleration since their
peak levels in october 2008. the liquidity
overhang emanating from the earlier
surge in capital inflows has substantially
moderated in 2008-09. the reserve bank
is committed to providing ample liquidity
for all productive activities on a
continuous basis. as the upside risks to
inflation have declined, monetary policy
has been responding to slackening
economic growth in the context of
significant global stress. accordingly, for
policy purposes, money supply (m 3 )
growth for 2009-10 is placed at 17.0
per cent. consistent with this, aggregate
deposits of scheduled commercial banks
are projected to grow by 18.0 per cent.
the growth in adjusted non-food credit,
including investment in bonds/
debentures/shares of public sector
undertakings and private corporate sector
and cps, is placed at 20.0 per cent. given
the wide dispersion in credit growth
noticed across bank groups during
2008-09, banks with strong deposit base
should endeavour to expand credit beyond
20.0 per cent. as always, these numbers
are provided as indicative projections and
not as targets.

65.
governments and central banks
all over the world have responded to
the ongoing global financial crisis by
initiating several large, aggressive and
unconventional measures. there is,
however, a contentious debate on whether
these measures are adequate and
appropriate and when, if at all, they will
start showing the desired results. there is
a separate debate on whether the measures
taken so far, responding as they are to
short-term compulsions, are eroding
long-term sustainability. many difficult
issues will need to be addressed going
forward. there is unprecedented
co-ordinated policy action on monetary,
fiscal, regulatory and institutional reforms
to address the ongoing financial and
economic crisis and strengthen the
international financial architecture. in this
context, the initiatives by the leaders of
25

67.
the second challenge going
forward is meeting the credit needs of the
non-food sector. although, for the year
2008-09 as a whole, credit by the banking
sector expanded, the pace of credit flow
decelerated rapidly from its peak in october
2008. this deceleration has occurred
alongside a significant decline in the flow
of resources from non-bank domestic and
external sources. the deceleration in total
resource flow partly reflects slowdown in
demand, drawdown of inventories by the
corporates and decline in commodity
prices. the expansion in credit, however,
has been uneven across sectors. there is,
therefore, an urgent need to boost the flow
of credit to all productive sectors of the
economy, particularly to msmes, to aid
the process of economic recovery. the
reserve bank continues to maintain and
will maintain ample liquidity in the
system. it should be the endeavour of
commercial banks to ensure that every
creditworthy borrower is financed at a
reasonable cost while, at the same time,
ensuring that credit quality is maintained.

the g-20 announced in april 2009 to:
(i) restore confidence, growth, and jobs;
(ii) repair the financial system to restore
lending; (iii) strengthen financial
regulation to rebuild trust; (iv) fund and
reform the international financial
institutions to overcome the crisis and
prevent future ones; (v) promote global
trade and investment and reject
protectionism to underpin prosperity; and
(vi) build an inclusive, green and
sustainable recovery, should help
overcome the uncertainty surrounding the
financial and economic outlook.
66.
here in india, there are several
immediate challenges facing the economy
which would need to be addressed going
forward. first, after five years of high
growth, the indian economy was headed for
a moderation in the first half of 2008-09.
however, the growth slowdown
accentuated in the third quarter of 2008-09
on account of spillover effects of
international developments. while the
moderation in growth seems to have
continued through the fourth quarter of
2008-09, it has been cushioned by quick
and aggressive policy responses both by the
reserve bank and the government.
notwithstanding the contraction of global
demand, growth prospects in india continue
to remain favourable compared to most
other countries. while public investment
can play a critical role in the short-term
during a downturn, private investment has
to increase as the recovery process sets in.
a major macroeconomic challenge at this
juncture is to support the drivers of
aggregate demand to enable the economy
to return to its high growth path.

68.
it may be noted that bank credit
had accelerated during 2004-07. this,
combined with significant slowdown of the
economy in 2008-09, may result in some
increase in npas. while it is not unusual
for npas to increase during periods of high
credit growth and downturn in the economy,
the challenge is to maintain asset quality
through early actions. this calls for a
focused approach, due diligence and
balanced judgment by banks.
69.
third, the reserve bank was able
to manage the large borrowing programme
of the central and state governments in
26

in this context, close monitoring of the
performance of the economy and the
proper sequencing of the unwinding
process would have to be ensured.

2008-09 in an orderly manner. the market
borrowings of the central and state
governments are expected to be higher in
2009-10. thus, a major challenge is to
manage the large government borrowing
programme in 2009-10 in a non-disruptive
manner. large borrowings also militate
against the low interest rate environment
that the reserve bank is trying to maintain
to spur investment demand in keeping with
the stance of monetary policy. the reserve
bank, therefore, would continue to use a
combination of monetary and debt
management tools to manage government
borrowing programme to ensure successful
completion of government borrowings in a
smooth manner. the reserve bank has
already announced an omo calendar to
support government market borrowing
programme through secondary market
purchase of government securities. during
the first half of 2009-10, planned omo
purchases and mss unwinding will add
primary liquidity of about rs.1,20,000
crore which, by way of monetary impact,
is equivalent to crr reduction of 3.0
percentage points. this should leave adequate
resources with banks to expand credit.

71.
fifth, a continued challenge is to
preserve our financial stability. the
reserve bank would continue to maintain
conditions which are conducive for
financial stability in the face of global
crisis. a sound banking sector, wellfunctioning financial markets and robust
payment and settlement infrastructure
are the pre-requisites for financial
stability. the banking sector in india
is sound, adequately capitalised and
well-regulated. by all counts, indian
financial and economic conditions are
much better than in many other countries
of the world. the single factor stress tests
carried out as part of the report of the
committee on financial sector assessment
(cfsa) (chairman: dr. rakesh mohan and
co-chairman: shri ashok chawla) have
revealed that the banking system in india
can withstand significant shocks arising
from large potential changes in credit
quality, interest rate and liquidity
conditions. these stress tests for credit,
market and liquidity risk show that indian
banks are generally resilient.

70.
fourth, another challenge facing
the indian economy is to restore the fiscal
consolidation process. the fiscal
stimulus packages by the government
and some other measures have led to
sharp increase in the revenue and fiscal
deficits which, in the face of slowing
private investment, have cushioned the
pace of economic activity. however, it
would be a challenge to unwind fiscal
stimulus in an orderly manner and return
to a path of credible fiscal consolidation.

72.
sixth, the reserve bank has
injected large liquidity in the system since
mid-september 2008. it has reduced the
crr significantly and instituted some
sector-specific facilities to improve the
flow of credit to certain sectors. the tenure
of some of these facilities has been
extended to provide comfort to the market.
while the reserve bank will continue to
support all the productive requirements of
27

abated. the reserve bank’s current
assessment is that wpi inflation could be
around 4.0 per cent by end-march 2010.
banks have indicated that small savings
rate acts as a floor to banks’ deposit
interest rate. it may, however, be noted that
small savings and bank deposits are not
perfect substitutes. banks should not,
therefore, be overly apprehensive about
reducing deposit interest rates for fear of
competition from small savings, especially
as the overall systemic liquidity remains
highly comfortable. there is scope for the
overall interest rate structure to move
down within the policy rate easing already
effected by the reserve bank. further
action on policy rates is now being taken
to reinforce this process.

the economy, it will have to ensure that as
economic growth regains momentum, the
large liquidity injected in the system is
withdrawn in an orderly manner. it is
worth noting that even as the monetary
easing by the reserve bank has potentially
made available a large amount of liquidity
to the system, at the aggregate level this
has not been out of line with our monetary
aggregates unlike in many advanced
countries. as such, the challenge of
unwinding will be less daunting for india
than for other countries.
73.
finally, we will have to address
the key challenge of ensuring an interest
rate environment that supports revival of
investment demand. since october 2008,
as the inflation rate has decelerated and
the policy rates have been reduced, market
interest rates have also come down.
however, the reduction in interest rates
across the term structure and across
markets has not been uniform. given the
cost plus pricing structure, banks have
been slow in reducing their lending rates
citing high cost of deposits. in this context,
it may be noted that the current deposit
and lending rates are higher than in
2004-07, although the policy rates are now
lower. reduction in deposit rates affects
the cost only at the margin since existing
term deposits continue at the originally
contracted cost. so lending rates take longer
to adjust. judging from the experience of
2004-07, there is room for downward
adjustment of deposit rates. with wpi
inflation falling to near zero, possibly likely
to get into a negative territory, albeit for a
short period, and cpi inflation expected to
moderate, inflationary risks have clearly

policy stance
74.
on the basis of the above overall
assessment, the stance of monetary policy
in 2009-10 will broadly be as follows:

28

•

ensure a policy regime that will enable
credit expansion at viable rates while
preserving credit quality so as to
support the return of the economy to a
high growth path.

•

continuously monitor the global and
domestic conditions and respond
swiftly and effectively through policy
adjustments as warranted so as to
minimise the impact of adverse
developments and reinforce the impact
of positive developments.

•

maintain a monetary and interest rate
regime supportive of price stability and
financial stability taking into account
the emerging lessons of the global
financial crisis.

moderation. the reserve bank will
continue to maintain vigil, monitor
domestic and global developments, and
take swift and effective action to minimise
the impact of the crisis and restore the
economy to a high growth path consistent
with price and financial stability.

75.
over the last several months, the
reserve bank has been actively engaged in
policy action to minimise the impact of the
global crisis on india. the policy response
of the reserve bank has helped in keeping
our financial markets functioning in a
normal manner and in arresting the growth

part b. developmental and regulatory policies 2009-10
and strengthen financial stability. there
is a great deal of thinking going on about
the appropriate design of the regulatory
framework that encourages credit flow
while mitigating risks. domestically,
although there has been some slowdown
in credit growth, particularly in the second
half of 2008-09, the banking system
remains inherently sound and the financial
markets including inter-bank markets are
functioning normally. nevertheless, the
unfolding of the global financial crisis
underscores the need for further
strengthening of regulation and
supervision even as india remains outside
the epicentre of the global crisis.

83.
the key objective of financial
sector policies is to aid the process of
economic growth consistent with price and
financial stability. in this context, the
reserve bank has been focusing on
improving credit delivery, developing
financial markets and promoting financial
inclusion. internationally, the financial
intermediation process has got
significantly affected by the ongoing
financial crisis. consequently, various
international bodies and financial
intermediaries have been contemplating
changes in the financial regulatory
architecture to restore normalcy in the
functioning of global financial markets

committee found india’s financial sector
to be broadly sound and resilient, it also
identified specific concerns. the committee
has made several recommendations towards
furthering financial sector development
over the medium term.

while india has been a part of the
global initiative, recently a comprehensive
assessment of the indian financial sector
has been conducted by the committee on
financial sector assessment (cfsa)
(chairman: dr. rakesh mohan and
co-chairman: shri ashok chawla)

consultation with the reserve bank. the
committee submitted its report to the

several international initiatives have been
taken in the recent period for formulating
proposals for strengthening the financial
system. the major initiatives in this regard
include the following:

several reports have been released recently
such as the financial stability forum’s (now
financial stability board) report on
‘enhancing market and institutional
resilience’, the geneva report on ‘the
fundamental principles of financial
regulation’, larosiere report on ‘the high
level group on financial supervision in the
eu’ and the turner review on ‘regulatory
response to the global banking crisis’.
the g-20 countries have also taken several
initiatives. in the summit held in
washington in november 2008, the g-20
countries laid down an action plan and
constituted four working groups, viz.,
(i) enhancing sound regulation and
strengthening transparency; (ii) reinforcing
international co-operation and promoting
integrity in financial markets; (iii) reform
of the imf; and (iv) the world bank and
other multilateral development banks

ii. interest rate policy
(b) payment of interest on savings bank
account on a daily product basis

(a) bplr system: review
87.
consequent to the mid-term
review of october 2005, the indian banks’
association (iba) issued guidelines for
determination of benchmark prime lending
rate (bplr) by banks for appropriate
pricing of credit. over time, however, the
system of bplr has evolved in such a
manner that it has lost its relevance as a
meaningful reference rate as bulk of loans
is advanced below bplr. furthermore,
this impedes the smooth transmission of
monetary signals and makes the loan
pricing system non-transparent. it has,
therefore, become necessary to review the
current procedures and processes of
pricing of credit. accordingly, it is
proposed:

•

88.
at present, interest on savings bank
accounts is calculated on the minimum
balances held in the accounts during the
period from the 10th day to the last day of
each calendar month. several banks have
suggested that interest on savings bank
accounts may be calculated either on the
minimum balances in the deposit accounts
during the period from the first to the last
day of each calendar month or on a daily
product basis. the matter was referred to the
iba, which was of the view that payment of
interest on a daily product basis would be
feasible only when computerisation in banks
is completed. in view of the present
satisfactory level of computerisation in
commercial bank branches, it is proposed that:

•

to constitute a working group to
review the present bplr system and
suggest changes to make credit
pricing more transparent. the
working group would consult all the
stakeholders and submit its report by
end-august 2009.

payment of interest on savings bank
accounts by scheduled commercial
banks (scbs) would be calculated on
a daily product basis with effect from
april 1, 2010.
modalities in this regard will be
worked out in consultation with banks.

regional rural banks) up to 1.0 per cent of
their net demand and time liabilities (ndtl)

a special refinance facility was
introduced on november 1, 2008 under
section 17(3b) of the reserve bank of
india act, 1934 to provide funding to

•
32

to extend this special refinance facility
up to march 31, 2010.

(b) special term repo facility: extension

exchange board of india (sebi) has taken
several measures to mitigate the liquidity
risks. in view of the systemic implications
of the activities of such funds, it is proposed:

90.
the reserve bank introduced a
special 14-day term repo facility for banks
in september 2008 through relaxation in the
maintenance of slr up to 1.5 per cent of
their ndtl, to enable them to meet the
liquidity requirements of mutual funds
(mfs), non-banking financial companies
(nbfcs) and housing finance companies
(hfcs). the auctions for the special 14day term repo are conducted on a daily
basis. on a review, it is proposed:

•

to extend the time for availability of
this special term repo facility to banks
up to march 31, 2010;

•

to conduct these 14-day term repo
auctions on a weekly basis.

•

(e) interest rate futures
93.
the
technical
advisory
committee (tac) for money, foreign
exchange and government securities
markets had released the report of the
working group on interest rate futures
(chairman: shri v. k. sharma) in august
2008. the working group had
recommended, inter alia, the introduction
of a physically settled contract based on a
10-year notional coupon bearing
government bond. the reserve bank has
already permitted banks to take trading
positions in interest rate futures (irfs). the
rbi-sebi standing technical committee
has completed the preparatory work and an
exchange traded irfs contract on the 10year notional coupon bearing government
bond is expected to be launched shortly.

(c) export credit refinance: review
91.
with a view to providing flexibility
in the liquidity management of banks, the
limit of the standing liquidity facility to
banks in terms of export credit refinance
(ecr) under section 17(3a) of the rbi act
was raised from 15.0 per cent of the eligible
outstanding rupee export credit as on the
preceding fortnight to 50.0 per cent in
november 2008. it is proposed:

•

to identify and address the macroprudential concerns arising from the
current framework in consultation
with sebi.

government securities market

to review the ecr limit in march 2010.

(a) central government securities

(d) money market mutual funds

(i) floating rate bonds

92.
the liquidity stress recently faced
by mutual funds, particularly the money
market mutual funds (mmmfs), was
caused primarily on account of
mobilisation of significant resources from
large corporates and banks with redemption
facilities on par with current accounts of
banks. in this regard, the securities and

94.
the floating rate bonds (frbs)
issued by the government of india till
september 2004 were linked to the cutoff yields of the 364-day treasury bills
(tbs), which led to certain issues relating
to the pricing of frbs in the secondary
market. reflecting this experience and
in consultation with market participants
33

consolidated bid on behalf of all its
constituents by the bank/primary dealer
(pd) in respect of non-competitive bids
will be implemented after the amendments
in the specific notification and in the
scheme for non-competitive bidding
facility by the government of india.

and the technical advisory committee on
money, foreign exchange and
government securities markets, the
structure has been revised. the revised
structure contemplates that: (i) the auction
will be conducted through the ‘price based’
process as against the ‘spread based’
process earlier; and (ii) the base yield for
frbs will be linked to the primary market
cut-off yield of the 182-day tbs. the
revised structure is expected to simplify
the methodology for pricing of frbs in
the secondary market. the revised issuance
structure for frbs has been built into the
negotiated dealing system (nds) auction
format being developed by the clearing
corporation of india limited (ccil).

(iii) ways and means advances to the
government of india: status
97.
the reserve bank, in consultation
with the government of india, has revised
the extant limits for the ways and means
advances (wma) for the financial year
2009-10. as per the revised arrangements,
the wma limits will continue to be fixed
on a half-yearly basis, and are placed at
rs.20,000 crore for the first half and
rs.10,000 crore for the second half of
2009-10. the applicable interest rate on
wmas and overdrafts will, as it is the
practice now, continue to be linked to the
repo rate. the reserve bank of india,
however, retains the flexibility to revise
the limits in consultation with the
government of india, taking into
consideration the prevailing circumstances.

95.
the indicative calendar for the
issuance of central government securities
provides for the issuance of frbs.
accordingly:

•

any new issuance of floating rate
bonds would be in terms of the revised
issuance structure.

(ii) auction process of government of
india securities
96.
as indicated in the mid-term
review of october 2008, the
recommendations of the internal working
group (chairman: h.r. khan) involving
the reserve bank such as reduction of the
time gap between bid submission and
declaration of auction results have already
been
implemented.

non-competitive bidding in the
auction of state development loans
(sdls): status

98.
in order to widen the investor base
and enhance the liquidity for sdls, a
scheme for non-competitive bidding in the
auction of sdls was notified by all the
state governments on july 20, 2007.
subsequent to the announcement in the
mid-term review of october 2008, the
34

the introduction of strips, has been
carried out as part of the public debt office
– nds (pdo-nds) platform maintained by
the reserve bank. furthermore, in order to
ensure sufficient volume/liquidity in
strips and considering the fungibility of
coupon strips, securities have been
identified that will be eligible for stripping/
reconstitution by the market participants.
accordingly:

necessary system changes required to handle
non-competitive bidding in the auction of
sdls have been carried out in the nds
auction platform developed by the ccil.
99.
the scheme for non-competitive
bidding in sdls will be operationalised
during the current financial year.
(ii) ways and means advances limits for
the state governments: status

•

100. the state-wise limits of normal
wma for the year 2009-10 have been kept
unchanged at the limits set for the year
2008-09. accordingly, the aggregate
normal wma limit for state governments
is placed at rs.9,925 crore, including the
wma limit of rs.50 crore for the
government of the union territory of
puducherry. all other terms and conditions
of the scheme remain unchanged.

(ii) revision of repo accounting
102. the accounting norms on repo
transactions prescribed by the reserve
bank in 2003, treated repo as a set of two
independent outright transactions.
consequent upon the amendment in 2006
to the reserve bank of india act, 1934, repo
has been defined as an instrument for
borrowing funds by selling securities.
accordingly, it was proposed to revise the
accounting guidelines to capture the
economic essence of repo as a collateralised
lending and borrowing instrument and not
as outright sale and purchase. accordingly,
it is proposed:

(c) development of market infrastructure
(i)

draft guidelines prepared in
consultation with the market
participants are being placed on the
reserve bank’s website for comments
and feedback by end-may 2009. with
the finalisation of the guidelines,
strips will be launched during the
current financial year.

separate trading for registered
interest and principal of securities
(strips)

101. stripping is the process of
converting periodic coupon payments and
the principal of an existing government
security into tradable zero-coupon
securities, i.e., separate trading for
registered interest and principal of
securities (strips). the availability of
strips across the term structure will aid
the development of a sovereign zerocoupon yield curve. as indicated in the
annual policy statement of april 2008, all
operational arrangements for the
introduction of strips are ready. the
required software development, critical for

to issue revised guidelines on repo
accounting, taking into account
comments on the draft guidelines
earlier placed on the reserve bank’s
website, by end-june 2009 for
implementation from april 1, 2010.

(iii) multi-modal
settlements
government securities: status

settlement of otc rupee interest rate
derivatives. the trade reporting platform
for otc rupee interest rate derivatives is
already functional.

in

103. as indicated in the annual policy
statement of april 2008, a new settlement
mechanism (multi-modal settlement)
through commercial banks has been put
in place to facilitate entities such as mutual
funds (mfs), which do not hold a current
account with the reserve bank, to directly
participate in the government securities
market. under the new mechanism, while
settlement of the securities leg continues
to take place in the sgl account maintained
with the reserve bank, the funds leg will
settle through the ‘designated settlement
banks’ (dsbs) appointed by the ccil. the
guidelines in the matter were issued on june
2, 2008. from june 30, 2008 onwards,
secondary market transactions in
government securities undertaken by mfs
are being settled only through this
mechanism.

(v) settlement of otc trades in
corporate bonds
106. for facilitating settlement of otc
corporate bond transactions in real-time
gross settlement (rtgs) system on a dvpi basis (i.e., on a trade-by-trade basis), it
has been decided, in consultation with the
sebi, to allow the clearing houses of the
exchanges to have a transitory pooling
account facility with the reserve bank.
under the proposed settlement
mechanism, the buyer of securities will
transfer the funds through his bank to this
transitory account through rtgs. the
clearing house will thereafter transfer the
securities from the seller’s account to the
buyer’s account and effect the release of
funds from the transitory account to the
seller’s account.

104. the facility of multi-modal
settlements can also be availed of by other
non-bank entities such as insurance
companies, pension funds and co-operative
banks which do not maintain a current
account with the reserve bank.

foreign exchange market
(a) ecbs: extension of relaxation of
all-in-cost ceilings
107. as per extant ecb policy, the allin-cost ceilings for ecbs are: libor plus
300 bps for ecbs with average maturity
period of three years and up to five years;
and libor plus 500 bps for ecbs with
average maturity of more than five years.
however, these all-in-cost ceilings have
been dispensed with up to june 30, 2009
subject to the condition that ecb proposals
above the prescribed all-in-cost ceilings,
irrespective of the amount of the borrowing,
will come under the approval route.

(iv) clearing and settlement of otc
rupee interest rate derivatives:
status
105. as indicated in the mid-term
review of october 2008, the ccil has
operationalised a clearing and settlement
arrangement for over-the-counter (otc)
rupee interest rate derivatives on a nonguaranteed basis since november 27, 2008.
as at end-march 2009, 13 members have
decided to participate in the non-guaranteed

accruing to indian companies, it is proposed
to increase the total amount of permissible
buyback, out of internal accruals, from us$
50 million of the redemption value per
company to us $ 100 million, by linking
the higher amount of buyback to larger
discounts. accordingly:

considering the continuing tightness of
credit spreads in the international markets,
it is proposed:

•

to extend the relaxation in all-in-cost
ceilings until december 31, 2009.

(b) liberalisation of the policy on
buyback of fccbs

•

108. recognising the benefits accruing
to the indian companies as well as to the
economy, the policy on the premature
buyback of fccbs was liberalised in
december 2008. the proposals for buyback
of fccbs by indian companies are being
considered both under the approval and
automatic routes, provided buyback is
financed out of their foreign currency
resources held in india or abroad and/or out
of fresh ecbs raised in conformity with the
current ecb norms and out of internal
accruals up to us $ 50 million of the
redemption value per company. the entire
procedure for buyback of fccbs is
required to be completed by december 31,
2009 and details of the buyback are also
required to be reported to the reserve bank.

indian companies may, henceforth, be
permitted, under the approval route,
to buy back fccbs out of internal
accruals with a minimum discount of
25 per cent of book value for
redemption amount of up to us $ 50
million, 35 per cent of book value for
redemption amount more than us $
50 million and up to 75 million; and
50 per cent of book value for
redemption amount more than us $
75 million and up to us $ 100
million.

(c) loans against non-resident deposits
111.
as per the extant norms,
authorised dealer category–i and
authorised banks are permitted to grant
loans up to rs.20 lakh against the security
of funds held in nr(e)ra and fcnr(b)
deposits. on a review, it is proposed:

109. in terms of the extant norms, the
reserve bank has been considering, under
the approval route, proposals from indian
companies for buyback of fccbs, out of
internal accruals, up to us $ 50 million
redemption value per company, at a
minimum discount of 25 per cent on the
book value. up to april 15, 2009, the
reserve bank has approved 18 proposals
for buyback of fccbs involving us $ 765
million with the discount ranging from 25
per cent to 50 per cent.

•

to enhance the cap of rs.20 lakh to
rs.1 crore with immediate effect.

(d) currency futures
112.
since the launch of the first
currency futures exchange in september
2008, currency futures contracts are being
traded in three recognised exchanges. the
average daily volume of currency futures
contracts traded on all the exchanges
increased from rs.260 crore in september
2008 to rs.2,181 crore in december 2008
and further to rs.5,235 crore in march

110.
the current policy has been
reviewed. keeping in view the benefits
37

us $ 10 million and us $ 50 million. however,
the upper limits of 6 per cent and 15 per
cent of the total open interest on the clients
and trading members remain unchanged.
the position limit for banks continues at
15 per cent of total open interest or us $
100 million, whichever is higher.

2009. the functioning of the exchanges
continues to be reviewed by the rbi-sebi
standing technical committee. on the
recommendation of the committee, the
position limits on the clients and trading
members have been doubled from us $ 5
million and us $ 25 million respectively to

iv. credit delivery mechanism and other banking services
(a) credit flow to the mse sector

(b) rural co-operative banks

113. as indicated in the mid-term
review of october 2008, the reserve
bank appointed a working group on
rehabilitation of sick smes (chairman:
dr. k.c. chakrabarty). the working
group made several significant
recommendations pertaining not only to
the issue of rehabilitation of sick smes
but also to the larger issues of credit flow
to the sme sector and other developmental
issues. while the recommendations on
which action is to be initiated by the
government of india, state governments
and sidbi are being forwarded to them,
it is proposed:

(i)

•

•

115. the committee on financial
sector assessment (chairman: dr. rakesh
mohan and co-chairman: shri ashok
chawla) has observed that there is a need
to draw up a roadmap for ensuring that only
licensed banks operate in the co-operative
space. the committee further suggested the
need for a roadmap to ensure that banks
which fail to obtain a licence by 2012
should not be allowed to operate. this will
expedite the process of consolidation and
weeding out of non-viable entities from the
co-operative space. accordingly, it is
proposed:

to issue guidelines to banks based on
the recommendations of the group,
by april 30, 2009.

114.
having regard to the need to
accelerate the credit flow to the micro and
small enterprises (mses) sector so critical
for employment, output and exports, it is
proposed:

•

licensing of co-operatives

to work out a roadmap for achieving
this objective in a non-disruptive
manner in consultation with
nabard.

(ii) revival of rural co-operative credit
structure: status
116.
as indicated in the annual policy
statement of april 2008, the government
of india approved a package for revival of
the short term rural co-operative credit
structure based on the recommendations of
the task force on revival of rural

to ask the standing advisory
committee on mses to review the
credit guarantee scheme so as to
make it more effective.
38

co-operative credit institutions (chairman:
prof. a. vaidyanathan). so far, 25 states
have
executed
memoranda
of
understanding (mous) with the
government of india and the nabard, as
envisaged in the package. eight states have
made necessary amendments in their cooperative societies acts. an aggregate
amount of rs. 4,740 crore has been
released by the nabard as the
government of india’s share for
recapitalisation of primary agricultural
credit societies (pacs) in eight states as
on february 28, 2009. eight state
governments have released their shares of
rs.459 crore for recapitalisation of pacs.
the national implementing and
monitoring committee (nimc), set up by
the government of india, is guiding and
monitoring the implementation of the
revival package on an all-india basis.

(ii) assistance to rrbs for adoption of
ict solutions for financial inclusion:
status
118.
the report of the working group
on defraying costs of ict solutions for
regional rural banks (chairman: shri g.
padmanabhan) was placed on the reserve
bank’s website in august 2008 for
comments from public. the group has,
inter alia, noted that apart from the northeastern region and jammu and kashmir,
there are 204 districts in several states
which have been identified by the
committee on financial inclusion
(chairman: dr. c. rangarajan) as areas
where there is a high level of financial
exclusion. it is, therefore, suggested that
these areas could also be considered for
special treatment. with a view to enabling
rrbs to adopt it based solutions for
financial inclusion, it is proposed:

(c) regional rural banks
(i)

•

capital to risk-weighted assets ratio
for rrbs

117.
the committee on financial sector
assessment (chairman: dr. rakesh mohan
and co-chairman: shri ashok chawla) has
suggested a phased introduction of capital
to risk-weighted assets ratio (crar) in the
case of rrbs, along with the recapitalisation
of rrbs after consolidation of these entities.
it is, therefore, proposed:

•

to work out, in consultation with
nabard, the manner of providing
assistance to rrbs adopting ict
solutions for financial inclusion in
districts identified as having high level
of exclusion by the committee on
financial inclusion.

(iii) amalgamation of rrbs
119.
consequent
upon
the
amalgamation of 156 rrbs into 45 new
rrbs sponsored by 20 banks in 17 states,
the total number of rrbs declined from
196 to 86 as at end-march 2009 (which
includes a new rrb set up in the union
territory of puducherry). the amalgamation
process is almost complete.

to introduce crar for rrbs in a
phased manner, taking into account the
status of recapitalisation and
amalgamation. a time-table for this
purpose would be announced in
consultation with nabard.
39

to all sponsor banks in october 2008 for
implementation. the report has, among
others, set september 2011 as the target date
for all rrbs to move towards cbs. also,
all rrb branches opened after september
2009 are required to be cbs compliant
from day one. in march 2009, sponsor
banks were advised to give their feedback/
status on implementation of the
recommendations of the report in respect
of rrbs sponsored by them.

(iv) recapitalisation of rrbs
120.
the union budget 2007-08
announced that rrbs, which have a negative
net worth, would be recapitalised in a phased
manner. as on march 31, 2009, 26 rrbs
have been fully recapitalised with an amount
of rs. 1,783 crore and one rrb has been
partially recapitalised with an amount of
rs.13 crore. the process of recapitalisation
has been completed except in respect of one
rrb in the state of uttar pradesh.

(d) delivery of credit to agriculture and
other segments of the priority sector

(v) scheduling of amalgamated rrbs
121. out of 45 amalgamated rrbs, 25
rrbs have been included in the second
schedule to the rbi act, 1934 while 76
erstwhile rrbs have been excluded from
the second schedule in terms of the
notification dated september 22, 2008
published in the gazette of india dated
november 15, 2008.
(vi) branch
licensing:
liberalisation

(i)

kisan credit card scheme

124. the kisan credit card (kcc)
scheme, introduced in 1998-99 to enable
farmers to purchase agricultural inputs and
draw cash for their production needs, was
revised to provide adequate and timely
finance for meeting the comprehensive
credit requirements of farmers under a
single window, with flexible and simplified
procedure, adopting a whole farm approach.
during 2008-09 (up to december 2008),
public sector banks (psbs) issued 3.9
million kccs with sanctioned limits
aggregating rs.23,366 crore. since the
inception of the scheme, psbs have issued
35.08 million kccs with sanctioned limits
aggregating rs.1,77,607 crore.

further

122. the mid-term review of october
2008 proposed to allow rrbs greater
flexibility in opening new branches as long
as they made profits and their financials
improved. the rrbs have obtained 345
licenses for opening branches in the
financial year 2008-09 and have opened
316 branches in the same period.
(vii) technology upgradation of rrbs

(ii) rural infrastructure development
fund

123. as indicated in the mid-term
review of october 2008, the
recommendation of the working group
(chairman: shri g. srinivasan) to prepare
a roadmap for migration to core banking
solutions (cbs) by rrbs, was forwarded

125. the interim budget 2009-10
announced the continuation of financing of
rural infrastructure projects for 2009-10 by
way of ridf xv which would be set up
with nabard with a corpus of rs.14,000
crore, and a separate window under ridf
40

(refinance) fund, rs.3,326 crore in msme
(refinance) fund, rs.250 crore in msme
(risk capital) fund and rs.1,760 crore in
rural housing fund.

xv for rural roads component of bharat
nirman programme with a corpus of
rs.4,000 crore.
126. consequent
upon
the
announcement made in the union budget
2008-09, several funds were set up such as:
(i) short-term co-operative rural credit
(stcrc) (refinance) fund with the
nabard with a corpus of rs.5,000 crore;
(ii) msme (refinance) fund and msme
(risk capital) fund with the small
industries development bank of india
(sidbi) with corpus of rs.1,600 crore and
rs.1,000 crore; and (iii) rural housing
fund with the national housing bank
(nhb) with corpus of rs.1,000 crore. the
annual policy statement of april 2008
announced that the shortfall in achievement
of 10 per cent sub-target for lending to
weaker sections by domestic scheduled
commercial banks will also be taken into
account for the purpose of allocating
amounts for contribution to the rural
infrastructure development fund (ridf)
maintained with the nabard or funds
with other financial institutions, as
specified by the reserve bank, with effect
from april 2009.

(e) interest subvention relief to farmers
128.
the union budget 2008-09
announced continuation of the interest
subvention scheme for short-term crop loans,
introduced in 2006-07. the rate of
subvention was increased from 2 per cent to
3 per cent for 2008-09. the interim budget
2009-10 announced that the government of
india would also continue to provide
interest subvention in 2009-10 to ensure that
farmers get short-term crop loans up to rs.3
lakh at 7.0 per cent per annum.
(f)

micro-finance

129.
the self-help group (shg)-bank
linkage programme has emerged as the major
micro-finance programme in the country
and is being implemented by commercial
banks, rrbs and co-operative banks. as on
march 31, 2008 3.6 million shgs had
outstanding bank loans of rs.17,000 crore,
an increase of 25 per cent over march 31,
2007 in respect of number of shgs credit
linked. during 2007-08, banks financed 1.2
million shgs for rs.8,849 crore. as at
end-march 2008, shgs had 5 million savings
accounts with banks for rs.3,785 crore.

127.
consequent upon the announcement
of measures by the reserve bank on
november 15, 2008 to sustain the growth
momentum in the employment-intensive
sectors of micro and small enterprises and
housing, the corpus of msme (refinance)
fund and rural housing fund was enhanced
by rs.2,000 crore (to rs.3,600 crore) and
by rs.1,000 crore (to rs.2,000 crore)
respectively. as on march 31, 2009 various
scheduled commercial banks have placed
deposits of rs.4,622 crore in stcrc

(g) financial inclusion
(i)

pilot project of state level bankers’
committee (slbcs) for 100 per cent
financial inclusion

130. so far, 344 districts have been
identified by slbcs for 100 per cent
financial inclusion. of these, 175 districts
41

in 21 states and 7 union territories have
reported having achieved the target. all
districts of haryana, himachal pradesh,
karnataka, kerala, uttarakhand, goa,
chandigarh, puducherry, daman & diu,
dadra & nagar haveli and lakshadweep
have reported having achieved the target
of 100 per cent financial inclusion.

region (ner), which are not found to be
commercially viable by banks, was
formulated, provided the state governments
made available necessary premises and other
infrastructural support. the government of
meghalaya has agreed to the proposal of
providing premises and security, and bids
have been received by psbs and rrbs for
setting up branches at centres identified by
the state government and are being
processed. action is being intitiated in
respect of other states in ner where
requests have been received.

131. as indicated in the mid-term
review of october 2008, the findings of
the external agencies entrusted with
conducting evaluation studies in achieving
the target of 100 per cent financial inclusion
in 26 districts were placed on the reserve
bank’s website for wider dissemination.
based on the findings, banks were advised
in january 2009, among other things, to
(i) ensure provision of banking services
nearer to the location of the no-frills
account holders through a variety of
channels; (ii) provide general credit card
(gcc)/small overdrafts along with no-frills
accounts to encourage the account holders
to actively operate the accounts; (iii) conduct
awareness drives so that the no-frills account
holders were made aware of the facilities
offered; (iv) review the extent of coverage
in districts declared as 100 per cent
financially included; and (v) efficiently
leverage on the technology enabled financial
inclusion solutions currently available.

(iii) setting up of credit counselling
centres on a pilot basis
133.
so far, banks have reported setting
up or proposing to set up 123 credit
counselling centres in various states of the
country. the feedback received in this regard
indicated that most of these centres were in
effect set up as extensions of the bank
branches and engaged in promotion of bank
specific products. accordingly, a model
scheme on financial literacy and credit
counselling centres (flccs) was formulated
and communicated to all scheduled
commercial banks and rrbs with the advice
to set up the centres as distinct entities
maintaining an arm’s length from the bank
so that the flcc’s services are available to
even other banks’ customers in the district.

(ii) special task force in north-eastern
region

(iv) setting up of rural self employment
training institutes

132. as indicated in the mid-term
review of october 2008, a scheme of
providing financial support to banks by the
reserve bank for setting up banking
facilities (currency chests, extension of
foreign exchange and government business
facilities) at centres, in the north-eastern

134. the reserve bank has issued
guidelines, framed by the government of
india, to the slbc convenor banks to set
up at least one rural self employment
training institute (rseti) in each district
by 2010. these institutions will train at least

lead bank scheme. the committee had
several rounds of discussions with different
state governments, banks and other
stakeholders, including academicians,
micro-finance institutions (mfis) and nongovernmental organisations (ngos). the
committee’s draft report will be placed on
the reserve bank’s website by may 15, 2009.

one youth in a family below poverty line
(bpl) in various fields and enhance
capacity building. in all, 134 rsetis have
been set up as on december 31, 2008. a
target for opening of 100 rsetis by banks
was set for the year 2008-09 and a grant of
rs. one crore per rseti has been
earmarked by the planning commission for
setting up the institutes. the regional
offices of the reserve bank have been
advised to monitor the progress of setting
up of rsetis under their jurisdiction on a
quarterly basis.

(i)

amendment to banking ombudsman
scheme 2006

136. the scope of the banking
ombudsman scheme, 2006 was widened
to include, inter alia, deficiencies arising
out of internet banking. under the amended
scheme, customers can lodge complaints
against banks for non-adherence to the
provisions of the fair practices code for
lenders or the code of bank’s commitment
to customers issued by the banking codes
and standards board of india (bcsbi).

(h) high level committee on lead bank
scheme
135.
as announced in the mid-term
review of the annual policy statement for
the year 2007-08, a high level committee
(chairperson: smt. usha thorat) with
members drawn from various financial
institutions, banks and chief secretaries of

v. prudential measures

•

(a) further relaxations in the branch
authorisation policy
137. the current branch authorisation
policy requires banks to have a medium
term plan in respect of branch expansion.
the request for opening of off-site atms
was also required to be a part of such plans.
on a review, it is proposed:

•

to constitute a group to review the
extant framework of branch
authorisation policy with a view to
providing greater flexibility, enhanced
penetration and competitive efficiency
consistent with financial stability.

(b) presence of foreign banks in india:
review

to allow scheduled commercial banks
(scbs) to set up offsite atms without
prior approval subject to reporting.

139. in february 2005, the government
of india and the reserve bank released the
‘roadmap for presence of foreign banks
in india’ laying out a two-track and
gradualist approach aimed at increasing the

138. with respect to branch
authorisation policy, it is proposed:
43

regulated financial institutions to withstand
large shocks.
this would require
modification in the reserve bank’s circular
of june 22, 2006. the reserve bank has been
encouraging banks to build floating
provisions as a buffer for the possible stress
on asset quality later. it is proposed:

efficiency and stability of the banking
sector in india. one track was the
consolidation of the domestic banking
system, both in private and public sectors,
and the second track was the gradual
enhancement of the presence of foreign
banks in a synchronised manner. the
roadmap was divided into two phases, the
first phase spanning the period march 2005
- march 2009, and the second phase
beginning april 2009 after a review of the
experience gained in the first phase.

•

140.
in view of the current global
financial market turmoil, there are
uncertainties surrounding the financial
strength of banks around the world. further,
the regulatory and supervisory policies at
national and international levels are under
review. in view of this, it is considered
advisable, for the time being, to continue
with the current policy and procedures
governing the presence of foreign banks in
india. the proposed review will be taken up
after due consultation with the stakeholders
once there is greater clarity regarding
stability, recovery of the global financial
system, and a shared understanding on the
regulatory and supervisory architecture
around the world.

to issue further detailed guidelines on
mitigating procyclicality later this
year after fsb, bcbs and committee
on global financial system (cgfs)
finalise their recommendations in this
regard.

(d) credit rating agencies
142.
in india, all credit rating agencies
are registered with the sebi. the reserve
bank has accorded accreditation to four
sebi registered credit rating agencies for the
limited purpose of using their ratings for
assigning risk weights within the framework
of the basel ii accord. since the indian
banking system has migrated to the basel ii
framework, there is a need to review the
performance of the credit rating agencies for
continuation of the accreditation, especially
by looking at the latest data relating to
cumulative default rate and transition matrix
of the rating agencies. accordingly:

•

(c) mitigating procyclicality: use of
floating provisions
141.
the g-20 working group on
enhancing sound regulation and
strengthening
transparency
has
recommended, as a part of measures to
mitigate procyclicality, that capital buffers
above minimum requirements and loan loss
provisions should be built up in good times
in order to enhance the ability of the

the reserve bank will liaise with sebi
on the issue of rating agencies’ adherence
to code of conduct fundamentals of the
international organisation securities
commissions (iosco).

(e) liquidity risk
143. in terms of the asset liability
management, liquidity of banks in india
is tracked through traditional maturity or
44

cash flow mismatches. the reserve bank
has examined the issue of banks
establishing a more robust liquidity risk
management framework that is well
integrated into the bank-wide risk
management process by adopting global
liquidity planning. in this context, banks
will be required to integrate their various
foreign currency assets and liabilities
positions from their branch operations in
india with the rupee asset liability position.
accordingly, it is proposed:

•

(f)

business correspondent (bc) model
and suggest measures, to enlarge the
category of persons that can act as
bcs, keeping in view the regulatory
and supervisory framework and
consumer protection issues.

•

(g) risk weights for exposure to central
counterparties

to prepare a draft circular detailing
the modalities for adopting the
integrated liquidity risk management
system as also the guidance note on
‘liquidity risk management’ based
on basel committee’s ‘principles for
sound liquidity risk management
and supervision’ brought out in
september 2008 as well as other
international best practices which
would be placed on the reserve
bank’s website by june 15, 2009.

145. a central counterparty (ccp) is an
entity that interposes itself between
counterparties to contracts traded within
one or more financial markets, becoming
the legal counterparty such that it is the
buyer to every seller and the seller to every
buyer. the ccil has been acting as a ccp
for banks in various segments of the
financial market. similarly, contracts like
interest rate futures and currency futures,
which are traded on the stock exchanges,
are also settled through the clearing houses
attached to these exchanges.

financial inclusion: relaxing
eligibility criteria for banking
correspondents

146. banks settling trades through
ccil/stock exchanges have two types of
exposures to these ccps. first, on account
of the on-balance sheet and off-balance
sheet transactions undertaken through the
ccp; and second, the exposure on account
of deposits/collateral kept with the ccps
to meet the margin requirements. it has
been decided to lay down the norms for
capital adequacy treatment of such
exposures. accordingly:

144.
with the objective of achieving
greater financial inclusion and increasing the
outreach of the banking sector, banks were
permitted, to use the services of ngos/mfis
set up as societies, trusts, section 25
companies, post offices, co-operative
societies and more recently retired bank
employees, ex-servicemen and retired
government employees as banking
correspondents (bcs). scaling up the bc
model is a challenge. it is, therefore, proposed:

•

to increase the maximum distance
criterion for the operation of the bc
for rural, semi-urban and urban areas
from the existing 15 kms. to 30 kms.

•

to constitute a working group to
examine the experience to date of the
45

the exposures on account of derivatives/
securities financing transactions trades
outstanding against all the ccps, will

strict capital and liquidity requirements.
therefore, there is need for banks to have
greater awareness of the risks inherent in
such activities and limit such exposures
commensurate with their risk management
and available capital. keeping in view the
reputational risk involved in such activities,
the reserve bank had mandated
maintenance of certain level of economic
capital in some of the cases approved in
the recent past. it is now proposed:

be assigned zero exposure value, as it
is presumed that the ccps’ exposures
to their counterparties are fully
collateralised on a daily basis, thereby
providing protection for the central
counterparty’s credit risk exposures;

•

•

the margin amounts/collaterals
maintained with the ccps will attract
risk weights appropriate to the nature
of the ccp. for ccil, the risk weight
will be 20 per cent and for other ccps,
it will be according to the ratings
assigned to these entities as per the
new capital adequacy framework.

•

the above prescription will be subject
to review on an on-going basis by the
reserve bank about the adequacy of
margin, quality of collateral and risk
management systems of the clearing
house/ccp.

(i)

to issue a paper on prudential
issues in banks’ floating and
managing private pools of capital
for eliciting public comments
which will form the basis for
finalising regulatory guidelines by
september 30, 2009.

stress testing

148.
in the mid-term review of october
2008, it was indicated that the reserve bank
would be upgrading the stress testing
guidelines. subsequently, the bcbs has
issued a paper on ‘principles for sound
stress testing practices and supervision’ in
january 2009 for comments. the paper
draws lessons for banks and supervisors
emerging from the financial crisis and
addresses weaknesses in stress testing,
including the specific areas of risk mitigation
and risk transfer. in this context, the cfsa
has recommended that there is a need for
the banks themselves to carry out such
periodic stress testing. it is proposed to
upgrade the stress testing guidelines once
bcbs finalises the paper based on
comments received.

(h) private pool of capital
147. it has been observed that indian
banks have recently been engaged in
sponsoring and managing private pools of
capital such as venture capital funds and
infrastructure funds. the g-30 report on
‘financial reform – a framework for
financial stability’ released on january 15,
2009, observed that large, systemically
important banking institutions should be
restricted in undertaking proprietary
activities that present particularly high risks
and serious conflicts of interest.
sponsorship and management of
commingled private pools of capital (that
is, hedge and private equity funds in which
the banking institutions own capital is
commingled with client funds) should
ordinarily be prohibited and large
proprietary trading should be limited by

(j)

securitisation of bank loans

149. the securitisation framework in
india is considered to be reasonably
46

prudent and has been able to minimise the
incentives that have led to the problems
which surfaced in the current crisis. it has
come to the reserve bank’s notice that
some banks have securitised loans
immediately after originating or purchasing
these from other banks. banks are also
dividing the total loan for one project into
different tranches and securitising a few
tranches even before the total disbursement
is complete, thus passing on the project
implementation risk also to the investors.
it is, therefore, proposed:

•

(k) certificate of registration to credit
information companies
150. in response to the reserve bank’s
press release of april 18, 2007 inviting
applications for grant of certificate of
registration from companies desirous of
entering into the business of credit
information under the credit information
companies (regulation) act, 2005, 13
applications were received. a high level
advisory committee (chairman: dr. r.h.
patil) set up by the reserve bank screened
the applications and recommended the
names of four applicants for issue of
certificate of registration. accordingly, ‘in
principle’ approvals have been issued to
these four applicants.

to prescribe a minimum lock-inperiod and minimum retention
criteria for securitising the loans
originated and purchased by banks.

vi. institutional developments

•

payment and settlement systems
(a) final guidelines for prepaid
payment instruments in india
151.
the enactment of the payment and
settlement systems act, 2007 has brought
the payment systems involved in the
issuance of prepaid payment instruments
under the regulatory jurisdiction of the
reserve bank. the reserve bank had earlier
placed the draft guidelines for issuance/
operation of such instruments in public
domain for wider dissemination and
feedback. taking into account the comments
received from various entities within and
outside the country, it is now proposed:

•

eligible non-bank entities, including
nbfcs, will be permitted to issue
semi-closed instruments, which can be
used to purchase all types of goods and
services at an identified network of
establishments.

the operating guidelines in this
regard are being issued separately.
(b) consolidation of information
technology systems: data centres
152. the reserve bank has set up data
centres which were made operational in
the second half of 2008. the state-of-theart data centres provide for a high level
of availability of information technology
(it) systems and ensure optimum
business continuity management. the
critical payment and settlement systems

to permit scbs which comply with the
eligibility criteria to issue all
categories of prepaid payment
instruments;
47

providers and ensure that adequate
fallback arrangements are put in place.

of the reserve bank are now operated
using the systems at the data centres.
adequate disaster recovery drills are
conducted at periodic intervals. while all
participating member banks have been able
to ensure full participation in these drills
by operating from their disaster recovery
(dr) sites, there are a few banks which
have not been able to meet this objective.
in view of the critical importance of such
drills and in order to achieve overall
systemic efficiency:

•

(d) network based operations: rbi
supported systems
154. the reserve bank has taken steps
to make the application systems [nds, real
time gross settlement (rtgs), centralised
funds management system (cfms) and
structured financial messaging solution
(sfms)] provided by it to operate in an
network based environment using the multi
protocol label switching (mpls). the
mpls approach by using a meshed network
topology provides increased redundancies
vis-a-vis a point to point connectivity at
cheaper costs without impacting the
security aspects. accordingly:

banks are urged to ensure full
compliance of these requirements.

(c) adequacy
of
the
fallback
arrangements for managed it
systems
153. currently, a number of banks have
resorted to the retention of service providers
to manage their it-based operational
requirements. it has, therefore, become
imperative that banks have adequate plans/
systems in place so as to manage risks
arising out of such outsourcing
arrangements. these risks arise on account
of excessive dependence by the system on
a single entity (concentration risk),
inadequate systems (operational risks) as
also on account of failure of these service
providers. the reserve bank has already
issued comprehensive outsourcing
guidelines in november 2006. the risk
management aspects detailed therein are of
particular relevance to a technology service
provider. hence, it is proposed that:

•

•

156. the volume of transactions through
national electronic clearing service
(necs), introduced in september 2008, is
also increasing. with a view to moving

banks are advised to migrate to the
mpls system on a time bound basis.

(e) recent developments
(i)

electronic payment systems

155. the coverage of bank branches
under the electronic payment network, viz.,
the rtgs and the national electronic
funds transfer (neft) has increased
significantly. while the neft network has
increased to 54,200 branches at end-march
2009, the rtgs network has increased to
55,000 branches. the rtgs handles, on
an average, 80,000 transactions per day,
with a peak of 1,28,295 transactions
processed as on march 30, 2009.
(ii) national electronic clearing service

banks
should
undertake
a
comprehensive review of all such
outsourced arrangements including
on-site inspections of critical service
48

(v) rationalisation of charges for
payment systems

towards the centralised necs system, the
electronic clearing service (ecs) (credit)
in mumbai has been merged with the
necs. as such no separate local ecs
clearing is operative in mumbai.

159. the reserve bank has rationalised
various charges for payment systems.
accordingly, service charges levied for
transfer of funds under outward rtgs
transactions shall not exceed rs.25 for
transactions of rs.1 lakh and up to rs.5
lakh, and rs.50 for transactions of rs.5 lakh
and above. similarly, for outward neft
transactions, service charges levied shall
not exceed rs.5 for transfer of funds up to
rs.1 lakh and rs.25 for transactions of rs.1
lakh and above.

(iii) national financial switch
157. the national financial switch
(nfs) membership/volume is steadily on
the increase. as on march 31, 2009 the nfs
network covered a total of 38,714
automated teller machines (atms) of 34
banks. on an average, a daily volume of
8,90,180 transactions (of which 2,56,156
transactions pertained to balance enquiry
and 6,34,024 pertained to cash withdrawal)
were routed through the nfs in march 2009
as against a daily volume of 2,67,598
transactions in march 2008. furthermore,
on an average, the daily value settled
through the nfs was around rs.45 crore
in march 2009 as against rs.26 crore in
march 2008. since april 1, 2009
customers have the facility of using atm
of any bank for cash withdrawal, free of
cost, thereby making atms national
payment outlets rather than bank-specific
outlets. this measure has seen a surge in
transactions in the nfs network with a
peak of 1.1 million transactions on a single
day on april 11, 2009.

160. the reserve bank has also
prescribed maximum charges which could
be levied for collection of outstation
cheques under which the service charges
would not exceed rs.50 for cheque value
up to rs.10,000. a maximum charge of
rs.100 would be levied for cheque value
of rs.10,000 – rs.100,000. the service
charge would not exceed rs.150 of cheque
value rs.100,001 and above.
(vi) cheque truncation system
161. the cheque truncation system
(cts) pilot project was operationalised in
delhi in february 2008 and more than 90
per cent of the cheque volume of delhi
clearing house is now processed through
the cts. the reserve bank continues to
take steps towards extending the cts
across the country and accordingly, it has
been decided to set up the cts in chennai.

(iv) mobile payments
158. as indicated in the mid-term
review of october 2008, the operative
guidelines for mobile payments were issued
on october 8, 2008. so far, 19 banks have
obtained permission from the reserve bank
to provide mobile payment facilities to their
customers.

(f)

the payment and settlement
systems act, 2007

162. as indicated in the mid-term
review of october 2008, the process of
49

comparable in size to medium-sized
commercial banks. furthermore, the panel
recommended: (i) a review of the existing
internal control systems, risk management
systems, asset liability management (alm)
and disclosure norms for ucbs; and (ii) the
issue of appropriate guidelines.
accordingly, it is proposed:

issuing authorisation to persons to operate
various payment systems has commenced
following the notification of the payment
and settlement systems act, 2007 in
august 2008. in terms of the act, all
payment system providers/operators
including credit card issuing companies and
entities engaged in money transfer activity
would require authorisation.

•

to review the existing instructions
and issue appropriate guidelines to
ucbs on internal controls, risk
management systems, alm and
disclosure norms;

•

to apply capital charge for market risks
in respect of large-sized and
systemically important ucbs with
effect from april 1, 2010.

urban co-operative banks
(a) area of operations of ucbs
163. in order to facilitate the growth of
well-functioning urban co-operative banks
(ucbs) in states, which enter into
memorandum of understanding (mou), it
is proposed:

•

to permit extension of area of
operation of tier ii ucbs in grade i
to the entire state of registration with
the prior approval of the reserve
bank.

(c) vision document for ucbs
165. the vision document for ucbs
envisaged signing of mou with the state
and
central
governments
for
harmonisation of dual regulation and
supervision of ucbs and setting up of task
force on urban co-operative banks
(tafcub) for identification of viable
ucbs for their rehabilitation and nonviable ucbs for their non-disruptive exit.
subsequent to the release of the vision
document in public domain in march 2005,
the reserve bank has entered into mous
with 25 state governments (nine entered
during april 2008 to march 2009). as of
date, 99 per cent of ucbs and 99 per cent
of deposits of the ucb sector are covered
under mou arrangements. the number of
ucbs in grade iii and iv, signifying
various degrees of sickness, has since
declined to 496 as on march 31, 2008 from
725 as on march 31, 2005. till march 31,

(b) review of regulatory and supervisory
framework: ucbs
164.
ucbs are presently on basel i
capital framework with surrogate (additional
risk-weight) capital charge on market risks.
the advisory panel on financial regulation
and supervision to the committee on
financial sector assessment (chairman:
dr. rakesh mohan and co-chairman:
shri ashok chawla), which looked into the
present regulatory and supervisory
framework for ucbs, has observed that it
would be premature for full migration of
ucbs to basel ii at this juncture. however,
it recommended assigning duration based
capital charge for market risk for scheduled
ucbs that are systemically important and
50

2009 licences had been cancelled or
rejected in respect of 85 banks and 31
unlicensed banks in mou states have been
issued banking licences. since the
recommencement of new branch
authorisation, 232 licences have been
issued for opening of branches by ucbs
in mou states. the initiatives for
voluntary mergers and amalgamations of
weak ucbs for bringing consolidation in
the sector were also carried forward and
new policy guidelines on mergers were
announced. sixty-eight mergers between
healthy and weak banks have been effected
so far. in view of the improved financial
condition and enhanced regulatory and
supervisory jurisdiction of the reserve
bank, additional business opportunities
were opened up for well-functioning
multi-state ucbs and ucbs in mou states.

further to 15 per cent by march 31, 2010.
taking into account the difficulty in raising
equity capital in the current economic
environment, it has been decided:

•

to defer the implementation of crar
of 12 per cent to march 31, 2010 and
of 15 per cent to march 31, 2011.

(b) time-frame for realisation of assets
by securitisation companies/
reconstruction companies
168. in terms of the extant guidelines,
securitisation
companies
(scs)/
reconstruction companies (rcs) are
required to realise the financial assets
within a specified time-frame, which shall
not in any case exceed five years from the
date of acquisition of financial assets.
requests for extending the time frame in
this regard are being examined. as an
interim measure, it is proposed:

(d) information technology support to
ucbs

•

166. based on the recommendations of
the working group which looked into ways
of supporting it initiatives of the ucbs,
idrbt is being asked to facilitate ucbs
availing of core banking platform on an
application service provider (asp) model.
with this, the ucbs will be able to put in
place cost-effective, modern technology so
as to render better customer service and
sound regulatory compliance.

(c) repossession of vehicles by nbfcs

to give an extension of two more
years for realisation of the assets in
respect of the security receipts
(srs) issued by scs/rcs which
have completed five years.

169. the issue of repossession of
vehicles in the event of non-payment of
interest and/or principal of loans given by
nbfcs has recently come into focus, and
some courts have also ruled in this regard.
the reserve bank has already advised
nbfcs to put in place a fair practices code
with the approval of their boards which,
inter alia, covers recovery of loans. the
issue has been discussed with the industry
participants and in view of certain queries
raised, it is further clarified that:

non-banking financial companies
(a) crar for nbfcs-nd-si
167. the mid-term review of october
2008 had indicated that the crar for
nbfcs-nd-si would be raised from 10 per
cent to 12 per cent by march 31, 2009 and
51

•

which has been notified as special purpose
vehicle for undertaking this operation. the
facility is meant exclusively for meeting the
temporary liquidity mismatches of the
nbfcs and not for asset growth.

nbfcs must have a built-in
re-possession clause in the contract/
loan agreement with the borrower
which must be legally enforceable. to
ensure transparency, the terms and
conditions of the contract/loan
agreement should contain detailed
provisions in this regard.

171. the facility was available for
eligible paper issued by nbfcs up to
march 31, 2009 with an overall ceiling of
rs.20,000 crore, which was subsequently
extended for eligible paper for a further
period of three months till june 30, 2009.
the facility has been availed to the extent
of rs.750 crore till date.

a circular to nbfcs to this effect
is being issued separately.
(d) special liquidity facility for eligible
nbfcs-nd-si
170. the central government had
announced an arrangement for providing
liquidity support to eligible nbfcs-nd-si
for meeting the temporary liquidity
mismatches through the industrial
development bank of india stressed asset
stabilisation fund (idbi sasf) trust,

second quarter review
172. the next review of the annual
statement on developmental and
regulatory policies will be undertaken as
part of the second quarter review of
monetary policy on october 27, 2009.

annex ii
g-20 working group on enhancing sound regulation
and strengthening transparency: current status of the
reserve bank on the recommendations
measures for strengthening the
regulation of the financial system were
considered by the g-20 working group on
enhancing sound regulation and
strengthening transparency. the
recommendations of the group and the
status with regard to the relevant items for
india are set out below.

domestic financial sector authorities to
jointly assess the systemic risks across the
financial system and to co-ordinate the
domestic policy response to limit the buildup in systemic risk. the structure of this
coordinating mechanism should be
transparent, with clear assignments of
roles, responsibilities and accountability
for each authority.

system-wide approach to financial
regulation

•

in india, the high level
co-ordination committee on financial
markets (hlccfm) provides a coordination mechanism among financial
sector regulators, viz., reserve bank of
india (rbi), securities and exchange
board of india (sebi), insurance
regulatory and development
authority (irda) and provident fund
regulatory and development
authority (pfrda). it is supported by
other technical committees/subcommittees, which examine issues
relating to entities under various
regulators that have cross-sector
implications.

•

there are separate technical
committees for rbi regulated entities,
sebi regulated entities and irda
regulated entities. these committees
review capital market related
developments and based on an early
warning system attempt to identify
any unusual developments that may

recommendation 1
as a supplement to their core
mandate, the mandates of all national
financial regulators, central banks, and
oversight authorities, and of all international
financial bodies and standard setters (iasb,
bcbs, iais and iosco) should take
account of financial system stability.

•

over the last few years, financial
stability has emerged as a key
objective of the reserve bank’s policy.
accordingly, several measures have
been taken in recent years to promote
financial stability. as recommended
by the committee on financial
sector assessment (cfsa), a
financial stability unit is being set up.

recommendation 2
within each country, there should
be an effective mechanism for appropriate
58

international table to jointly assess the
systemic risks across the global financial
system and to coordinate policy responses.

require
co-ordinated
action.
exchange-traded currency futures and
interest rate futures, financial
conglomerate monitoring framework,
crisis management group and a
corporate bond and securitisation
advisory committee have been
introduced through co-ordination of
inter-regulatory agencies.

•

recommendation 3
financial sector authorities should
have suitable macroprudential tools to
address systemic vulnerabilities.

•

the g-20 has redesignated the
financial stability forum (fsf) to
financial stability board (fsb) and its
membership has, inter alia, been
enlarged to include, all g-20 member
countries, including india. the reserve
bank, the government of india and the
sebi look forward to contributing
actively and effectively to the work and
initiatives of the fsb and the bcbs.

scope of regulation

the reserve bank has been using
various macro-prudential tools to
address banking system risks. for
instance, during the expansionary
phase of 2004-07, the reserve bank
took various measures to restrict
unbridled growth of credit. these
included increased provisioning for
standard advances and increased risk
weights in respect of certain asset
classes. however, subsequently, during
slow credit growth phase beginning
november 2008, those counter-cyclical
measures were reversed. the reserve
bank will continue to make efforts to
develop and use further macroprudential tools and would also
consider using any tools that may be
developed or recommended by
international standard setting bodies.

recommendation 5
all systemically important
financial institutions, markets and
instruments should be subject to an
appropriate degree of regulation and
oversight, consistently applied and
proportionate to their local and global
systemic importance. non-systemically
important financial institutions, markets
and instruments could also be subject to
some form of registration requirement or
oversight, depending on the type and degree
of risk posed, for example for the integrity
or efficiency of markets.
national authorities should have
the authority to expand the perimeter of
regulation in a timely way, recognizing
that it may vary across countries and

recommendation 7
large
complex
financial
institutions require particularly robust
oversight given their systemic importance,
which arises in part from their size and
interconnectedness (or correlation) with
other institutions, and from their influence
on markets.

issues relating to expansion of the
perimeter of regulation to those
institutions which are not prudentially
regulated and are systemically
important could be deliberated in the
hlccfm.

•

following the report on financial
conglomerates (fcs), a monitoring
mechanism for the identified fcs has
been in place since 2004 in
cooperation with other regulators. since
april 2005, the fc monitoring
mechanism has been further
strengthened with the introduction of
half-yearly discussion with the
ceos of the major group entities
within the fc.

•

as indicated in the mid-term review
of october 2008, an ‘approach paper’
on the supervision of financial
conglomerates has since been
prepared by an internal group. the
recommendations of the group are
being examined from the regulatory
and supervisory perspectives for
initiating appropriate action.

recommendation 6
the systemic importance of
financial institutions, markets and
instruments depends on a wide range of
factors, including their size, leverage,
interconnectedness, as well as funding
mismatches. the imf, in consultation with
the bis and the expanded fsf and other
bodies, should jointly develop a common
international framework and guidelines to
help national authorities assess whether a
financial institution, market or an instrument
is systemically important as consistently as
possible across jurisdictions.

•

the reserve bank is committed to
follow sound international practices
and standards. when a common
international framework is available
to help national authorities to assess
whether a financial institution, market
or an instrument is systemically
important, the reserve bank will use
the framework to further sharpen its
focus with regard to the supervision
of those institutions considered
systemically important in consultation

•

as part of its endeavour to
strengthen the supervision of banking
groups, the reserve bank extended
the major elements of prudential
regulations, viz., capital adequacy and
exposure norms to all the subsidiaries
of commercial banks in 2003.

recommendation 8

•

in india, all credit rating agencies are
registered with the sebi. the reserve
bank has accorded accreditation to four
credit rating agencies registered with
the sebi for the limited purpose of
using their ratings for assigning risk
weights within the framework of the
basel ii accord which has been
implemented by all banks as at the end
of march 2009. prior to the
accreditation, the reserve bank had
undertaken a review of the rating
agencies’ practices and procedures to
ensure that they comply with the
criteria prescribed for accreditation in
the basel ii framework.

•

since the indian banking system has
migrated to the basel ii framework,
there is a need to review the
performance of the credit rating
agencies for continuation of the
accreditation, especially by looking at
the latest data relating to cumulative
default rate and transition matrix of the
rating agencies. the reserve bank
will liaise with the sebi on the issue
of rating agencies’ adherence to the
iosco
code
of
conduct
fundamentals.

the boundaries of the regulatory
framework should be reviewed periodically
within national jurisdictions, in light of
financial innovation and broader trends in
the financial system. international bodies
will promote good practice and consistent
approaches in this area.

•

•

the reserve bank regularly interacts
with other regulators of the financial
system within the national jurisdiction,
viz., sebi, the securities regulator,
irda, the insurance regulator and
pfrda, the regulator of pension funds.
the reserve bank has also been
associated with various international
bodies such as g-20 and the bis, and
now also with the fsb and the bcbs.
the issue of review of the boundaries
of the regulatory framework will be
kept in focus, both in the interaction
with sectoral regulators within the
national jurisdiction and with
international bodies.

oversight of credit rating agencies
recommendation 9
all credit rating agencies whose
ratings are used for regulatory purposes
should be subject to a regulatory oversight
regime that includes registration and that
requires compliance with the substance of
the iosco code of conduct fundamentals.
national authorities should obtain the
authority to enforce compliance and require
changes to a rating agency’s practices and
procedures for managing conflicts of
interest and for assuring the transparency
and quality of the rating process.

private pools of capital
recommendation 10
private pools of capital, including
hedge funds, can be a source of risk owing
to their combined size in the market, their
use of leverage and maturity mismatches,
and their connectedness with other parts
of the financial system. they or their
managers should therefore be required to
register with financial authorities and

methodology. the assessment,
comprising six volumes, has been
published and put in the public domain
along with the comments of the
internationally acclaimed peer
reviewers on march 30, 2009. the
reserve bank will set up a task force
to take steps for implementation of the
recommendations of the two g-20
working groups viz., enhancing sound
regulations and strengthening
transparency, and reinforcing
international co-operation and
promoting integrity in financial
markets and will also continuously
monitor the implementation. the task
force will also look into all the issues
that have arisen and what follow-up
actions relevant to the reserve bank
need to be taken regarding the recently
released report of the committee on
financial

in india, venture capital funds and
mutual funds are registered and
regulated by the sebi. hedge funds
do not operate in india at present. the
reserve bank proposes to issue a
paper on prudential issues in banks’
floating and managing private pools
of capital to finalise the regulatory
guidelines.

transparent assessment of regulatory
regimes
recommendation 11
all g-20 members should commit
to undertake a financial sector assessment
program (fsap) report and to publish its
conclusions. national authorities may also
periodically undertake a self-assessment
of their regulatory frameworks based on
internationally agreed methodologies
and tools.

•

india first participated in an fsap in
2001 conducted by the imf and the
world bank and also associated with
the independent assessment of
standards and codes by the fund/bank.
it also conducted a self-assessment of
compliance with international
standards and codes in 2002 and its
review in 2004 and put these reports in
public domain. since the last fsap in
2001, india has undertaken a series of
ongoing reforms in the financial sector
aimed at improving its soundness,
resilience and depth. india has
completed a comprehensive selfassessment of the financial sector in

particularly the bcbs, should develop and
implement supervisory and regulatory
approaches to mitigate procyclicality in the
financial system by promoting the build-up

as against the basel norm for minimum
crar of 8 per cent, in india, banks
are required to maintain a minimum
crar of 9 per cent. the overall
crar of all scheduled commercial
banks continued to be strong and it was
at 13 per cent at the end-march 2008
and 13.1 per cent at end-december
2008. the reserve bank recognises
the need for mitigating the element of
procyclicality embedded in the
regulatory norms as it may exacerbate
cyclical trends. with this objective in
view, the reserve bank has been
employing a menu of macroprudential
tools to mitigate the impact of
procyclicality.

•

the reserve bank introduced the asset
classification and loan provisioning
norms in the year 1991-92 which
prescribe the minimum provisioning
based on classification of assets.
certain areas of difference exist
between the requirements of
accounting standards in respect of loan
loss provisioning (accounting
perspective) and the reserve bank’s
present regulatory approach and the
basel ii approach of calculating
expected loan losses (regulatory
perspective). internationally, there are
attempts for a convergence in this
regard between the accounting task
force (atf) of the bcbs and the
iasb. the reserve bank will fine
tune its policies in tandem with
developments at international level in
this regard.

•

the reserve bank has, over the years,
issued guidelines on valuation of
various instruments/assets in
conformity with the international best
practices while keeping india-specific
conditions in view. in order to

disclosure requirements which allow

fsb and member bodies, bcbs and
cgfs have been entrusted with the
work of developing regulatory and
supervisory approaches to mitigate
procyclicality. they are expected to
develop a strategic plan by fall 2009.
india will take further action in this
regard as per global consensus
emerging from the work of
international bodies.

recommendation 13
accounting standard setters should
strengthen accounting recognition of loan
loss provisions by considering alternative
approaches for recognizing and measuring
loan losses that incorporate a broader
range of available credit information. they
should also examine changes to relevant
standards to dampen adverse dynamics

to comply with the accounting
standard (as) on disclosure of
accounting policies issued by the
institute of chartered accountants of
india (icai).

•

once conditions in the global financial
system recover, the reserve bank
would consider enhancing the
minimum capital standards in tandem
with the proposals at the international
level. the build-up of capital and
provisioning buffers in good times will
be encouraged by the reserve bank
so that capital can absorb unexpected
losses and be drawn down during
difficult times.

capital

recommendation 15

recommendation 14

g-20 leaders should support the
progressive adoption of the basel ii capital
framework, which will continue to be improved
on an ongoing basis, across the g-20.

capital should serve as an effective
buffer to absorb losses over the cycle, so
as to protect both the solvency of financial
institutions in the event of losses, and their
ability to lend.

•

in the near term, capital buffers
above required minimums should be
allowed to decline in response to
deteriorating economic conditions and
credit quality, and urgent consideration
should be given to measures that would
facilitate access to additional private sector
capital in the downturn.
once conditions in the financial
system have recovered, the adequacy of
the international standard for the
minimum level of capital for banks should
be reviewed and the quality and global
consistency of capital should be enhanced.
in addition, capital buffers above
minimum requirements and loan-loss
provisions should be built up in good
times in order to enhance the ability of

all commercial banks in india were
basel ii compliant as on march 31,
2009. initially the base approach of the
basel ii framework have been
adopted. the reserve bank has
placed on its website a draft circular
giving an indicative timeframe for
implementation of the advanced
approach of the basel ii framework.
the enhancement to current basel ii
framework by the international
standard setting bodies will be
considered for implementation as
appropriate.

liquidity
recommendation 16
prudential supervisors and central
banks should deliver a global framework for
promoting stronger liquidity buffers at

recommendation 18

banks, including cross-border institutions, to
ensure that they can withstand prolonged
periods of market and funding liquidity stress.

•

•

central counterparties should be
subject to transparent and effective
oversight by prudential supervisors and
other relevant authorities, including
central banks, and meet high standards in
terms of risk management, operational
arrangements, default procedures, fair
access and transparency. the cpss and
iosco should review their experiences in
applying their recommendations for
central counterparties to derivatives.

indian banks have a significant
holding of liquid instruments as they
are required to maintain cash reserve
ratio and statutory liquidity ratio (5 per
cent and 24 per cent of their net
demand and time liabilities, as at
present). the substantial crr/slr
holding offers, in effect, a good
liquidity buffer. there are prudential
norms governing unsecured overnight
borrowings by banks and inter-bank
liabilities.
the reserve bank has examined the
issue of banks establishing a more
robust liquidity risk management
framework that is well integrated into
the bank-wide risk management
process by adopting global liquidity
planning. in this context, banks will be
required to integrate their various
foreign currency assets and liabilities
positions from their branch operations
in india with the rupee asset liability
position.

the ccil provides an institutional
structure for the clearing and settlement
of transactions undertaken in

recommendation 17
financial institutions should
continue to strengthen the infrastructure
supporting otc derivatives markets. in the
case of credit derivatives, this includes
standardizing contracts to facilitate their
clearing through a central counterparty.

•

prudential supervisors should
enhance their oversight of compensation
schemes by taking the design of
remuneration systems into account when
assessing risk management practices. the
bcbs should more explicitly integrate this
dimension in its guidance for the
assessment of risk management practices
by national prudential supervisors.

the recommendations of the cpss
and the iosco when available will be
applied as appropriate to ccil.

compensation schemes and risk
management
recommendation 19
large financial institutions should
ensure that their compensation frameworks
are consistent with their long-term goals
and with prudent risk-taking. as such, the
boards of directors of financial institutions
should set clear lines of responsibility and
accountability
throughout
their
organizations to ensure that the design and
operation of its remuneration system
supports the firm’s goals, including its
overall risk tolerance. shareholders may
have a role in this process. boards should
also ensure there are appropriate
mechanisms for monitoring remuneration
schemes.

•

in terms of section 35 b of the
banking regulation act, 1949
banks in the private sector and
foreign banks in india are required
to obtain the approval of the
reserve bank for remuneration
payable to their ceos (the
remuneration of public sector bank
ceos is fixed by the government
of india).

•

while devising the total
remuneration package (including all
perquisites and bonus) of ceos and
whole-time directors, boards of
private banks are required to ensure
that the total package is reasonable
in the light of industry norms
including size of the business in
india.
the
compensation
committee which looks into the
remuneration issue is required to
have adequate representation of
independent directors and directors,
if any, representing major
institutional shareholders in india.
remuneration of foreign banks’
ceos is mainly driven by the
policies of their head offices.

the reserve bank would
recommend the implementation of

recommendation 20
in order to promote incentives for
prudent risk taking, each financial
institution must review its compensation
framework to ensure it follows sound
practice principles developed by the fsf.
these include the need for remuneration
systems to provide incentives consistent
with the firm’s long-term goals, to be
adjusted for the risk taken by employees, and
for the variable components of compensation
to vary symmetrically according to
performance.

transparency

•

the reserve bank has, over the years,
issued guidelines on valuation of
various instruments/assets in
conformity with the international best
practices while keeping india-specific
conditions in view.

•

the securitisation framework in india
is considered to be reasonably prudent
and has been able to minimise the
incentives that have led to the
problems which surfaced in the
current crisis.

recommendation 22
accounting standard setters should
accelerate efforts to reduce the complexity
of accounting standards for financial
instruments and enhance presentation
standards to allow the users of financial
statements to better assess the uncertainty
surrounding the valuation of financial
instruments.

•

•

international accounting standards/
international financial reporting
standards (ias/ifrs) are adopted as
a basis for formulation of indian
standards and due consideration is
given to local customs, usage,
practices, legal and regulatory
environment. the reserve bank has
taken a proactive role in the area of
adherence by banks to the accounting
standards. the reserve bank also
actually participates in the standard
setting process through its nominees
in the accounting standards board
and the national advisory committee
on accounting standards.

recommendation 23
the iasb should enhance its efforts
to facilitate the global convergence towards
a single set of high-quality accounting
standards by sharing the experience of
countries that have completed this process
and by providing technical assistance.

•

iasb is in the process of issuing a new
globally accepted standard in place

accounting standards are generally in
alignment with international accounting
standards, except for some
modifications to suit local customs,
usages and level of development in the

strengthen regulatory frameworks. in
addition, iosco, the iais and the bcbs
should have the appropriate capacity to
provide technical assistance. the needs of
emerging market economies deserve
particular consideration.

enforcement
recommendation 24
the effective enforcement of
regulation should be a priority of all
financial regulators. as such, national
financial regulators and oversight
authorities should ensure the effectiveness
of their enforcement activities and that
appropriate resources are available for
monitoring the application of regulation
and for prosecuting offenders. the
enforcement function should be
independent from other activities or from
external influences.

•

•

regulations issued by the reserve
bank are monitored by its supervisory
department. the banking regulation
act, 1949 has prescribed extensive
penalties for non submission or willful
omission of information, for making
false statements, and for not following
directions issued by the reserve bank.
apart from this, the reserve bank can
impose penalties under specific
powers granted to it under the act.
similar provisions exist in the credit
information companies (regulation)
act, 2005 and the payment and
settlement systems act, 2007. the
penalties imposed by the reserve
bank under the br act are placed in
public domain.

india has been striving for adopting
the international best practices,
tailored to country-specific conditions.
accordingly, the capacity building of
all stakeholders has been progressively
upgraded. the reserve bank has also
conducted several international
seminars often in collaboration with
international bodies, to upgrade the
skill levels in various developing
economies. the reserve bank will
continue such efforts.
