statement by dr. y. venugopal reddy,
governor, reserve bank of india on the
mid-term review of annual policy
for the year 2006-07
this statement consists of two parts: part i. review of
annual statement on monetary policy for the year 2006-07; and
part ii. review of annual statement on developmental and
regulatory policies for the year 2006-07. an analytical review
of macroeconomic and monetary developments was issued, a
day in advance as a supplement to part i of this statement,
providing the necessary information and technical analysis with
the help of charts and tables.

part i. mid-term review of annual statement on
monetary policy for the year 2006-07
2.
this part is divided into three sections: i. assessment of
macroeconomic and monetary developments during the first
half of 2006-07; ii. stance of monetary policy for the second
half of 2006-07; and iii. monetary measures.
i. assessment of macroeconomic and monetary
developments during the first half of 2006-07
domestic developments
3.
estimates released at the end of september 2006 by the
central statistical organisation (cso) point to an upswing in
domestic economic activity. real gdp growth during the first
quarter of 2006-07 is placed at 8.9 per cent as against 8.5 per cent
in the corresponding quarter a year ago. real gdp growth
originating in agriculture, industry and services sectors was
3.4 per cent, 9.7 per cent and 10.5 per cent, respectively, as
1

against 3.4 per cent, 9.5 per cent and 10.1 per cent in the first
quarter of 2005-06.
4.
available information indicates that this early acceleration
of growth has been sustained in the second quarter (julyseptember) of 2006-07. rainfall during the 2006
south-west monsoon season, i.e., june-september was at
99 per cent of its long period average for the country as
a whole. moisture distribution was reasonably even, with deficient
rainfall in 10 of the 36 meteorological subdivisions and excess
rainfall in 6 subdivisions. first estimates of the ministry of
agriculture place kharif foodgrains production conservatively at
105.22 million tonnes, below the target of 115.25 million tonnes
and also lower than 109.70 million tonnes recorded last year.
these early estimates are likely to be revised as the outcome
for the kharif season becomes clearer. as on october 19, 2006
live storage in 76 major reservoirs was 89 per cent of the full
reservoir level and 26 per cent higher than the last 10 years’
average level. while the improvement in water storage levels
strengthens the prospects for rabi production, it is necessary to
monitor further developments to make a realistic assessment.
5.
industrial output has picked up momentum, supported by
favourable demand conditions, resilient business confidence and
strong corporate profitability. the index of industrial production
(iip) increased by 10.6 per cent during april-august 2006 as
against 8.7 per cent a year ago. manufacturing has been the
engine of industrial growth, rising by 11.8 per cent (9.6 per cent
a year ago), the highest since 1996-97. mining and electricity
generation grew by 3.1 per cent (1.6 per cent) and 5.7 per cent
(6.0 per cent), respectively. the acceleration in manufacturing
activity was led by basic metals and alloys, non-metallic mineral
2

products, machinery and transport equipment, textile products
and basic chemicals and products. the use-based classification
indicates a firming up of investment demand as reflected in an
increase of 18.6 per cent (13.8 per cent) in capital goods
production. demand pressures were also reflected in a growth
of 8.3 per cent (6.9 per cent) in production of basic goods and
9.5 per cent (3.5 per cent) in intermediate goods. production of
consumer goods rose by 11.3 per cent (13.7 per cent), mainly
driven by consumer durables. demand-pull impulses seem to
be percolating into the consumer non-durables segment, too.
the six infrastructure industries, comprising nearly 27 per cent
of the iip, posted a growth of 6.7 per cent during april-august,
2006 as against 6.1 per cent a year ago. petroleum refinery
products registered double-digit growth and acceleration was
recorded in the production of crude petroleum. the growth of
cement production, electricity and finished steel decelerated while
the growth of coal production was the same as a year ago.
6.
private corporate sector performance seems to have
picked up after some moderation that set in during the
second half of 2005-06. sales of sample companies grew
by 25.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2006-07 – up from
18.5 per cent a year ago – resulting from robust domestic and
export demand conditions, excise duty reduction
(e.g., automobiles, information technology (it) industries), cost
saving initiatives ( e.g., automobiles, cement, fast moving
consumer goods i.e., fmcg), volume growth (e.g., auto, cement,
it) and higher sales realisations (e.g., non-ferrous metals, fmcg,
cement). net profits of the selected companies increased by
34.7 per cent on top of a growth of 54.2 per cent in the
corresponding quarter last year. early results for the second
quarter of 2006-07 indicate that the performance of the private
3

corporate sector continued to be impressive in terms of the
growth in sales and post-tax profits.
7.
the reserve bank’s industrial outlook survey indicates
cautious optimism on the growth outlook. the business
expectations index for july-september, 2006 and octoberdecember, 2006 is lower than in the preceding quarters but
higher than in corresponding quarters a year ago. there is an
improvement perceived in demand conditions as reflected in
order books. expectations of a rise in capacity utilisation and
employment are indicating higher working capital finance
requirements. a majority of the respondents reported increase
in raw material prices, with raw material and finished goods
inventories at around the average level. business expectation
surveys conducted by most other agencies also indicate
a cautiously optimistic outlook in terms of overall economic
conditions and investment climate. the business confidence index
for september-october, 2006 compiled by one agency has risen
by 7.6 per cent over the previous round on improved expectations
about the overall economic conditions, the investment climate,
financial position of firms and some improvement in capacity
utilisation which is at its peak level. seasonally adjusted
purchasing managers’ indices signal improvement in operating
conditions, driven by strong domestic and overseas demand.
8.
a contextual analysis of the co-movement between
macroeconomic performance and bank credit in the current phase
of the business cycle suggests that factors other than demand
may also be at work: financial deepening from a low base;
structural shifts in supply elasticities; rising efficiency of credit
markets; and competitive pressures augmenting the overall
supply of credit. credit extended by scheduled commercial banks
4

(scbs) increased by rs.1,36,643 crore (9.1 per cent) during the
current financial year up to october 13, 2006 as compared with
the increase of rs.1,19,168 crore (10.3 per cent) in the
corresponding period last year. food credit declined by rs.7,246
crore – as against a decline of rs.2,808 crore in the previous
year – reflecting lower procurement of foodgrains during the
current financial year. non-food credit registered an increase of
rs.1,43,889 crore (9.8 per cent) as compared with an increase
of rs.1,21,976 crore (11.0 per cent) in the corresponding period
of the previous year.
9.
on a year-on-year basis, non-food credit of scbs
exhibited a growth of rs.3,76,105 crore (30.5 per cent) as on
october 13, 2006 on top of an increase of rs.2,97,903 crore
(31.8 per cent) a year ago. provisional information available
from select scbs for june 2006 indicates that within the services
sector which currently absorbs about 49 per cent of non-food
bank credit, retail lending rose by 47 per cent on a year-on-year
basis with growth in housing loans being 54.3 per cent. as
a result, the share of retail credit in total bank credit increased
marginally from 26.8 per cent in june 2005 to 27.3 per cent in
june 2006. loans to commercial real estate almost doubled
during the period, increasing their share in total bank credit from
1.4 per cent to 2.0 per cent. the year-on-year growth in credit to
industry was of the order of 26.6 per cent by june 2006; however,
its share in total bank credit fell from 43.2 per cent in june 2005
to 37.8 per cent in june 2006. substantial increases
were observed in credit flow to industries like infrastructure
(28.3 per cent), metals (38.0 per cent), textiles (32.2 per cent),
engineering (23.0 per cent), vehicles (33.0 per cent), gems
and jewellery (46.3 per cent), food processing (25.8 per cent)
and construction (59.7 per cent). shares of bank credit to
5

infrastructure, metals and textile industries in total credit to
industry increased from 19.8 per cent, 11.1 per cent
and 10.8 per cent, respectively, in june 2005 to 20.1 per cent,
12.1 per cent and 11.3 per cent, respectively, in june 2006. the
year-on-year growth in bank credit to agriculture was of the
order of 37 per cent by june 2006. the share of agriculture in
total bank credit rose marginally from 13.1 per cent in march
2006 to 13.4 per cent in june 2006.
10.
banks’ investments in shares, bonds/debentures and
commercial paper increased by 1.8 per cent (rs.1,466 crore)
during the current year up to october 13, 2006 against a decline
of 10.5 per cent (rs.9,828 crore) in the corresponding period
last year. scbs’ investments in instruments issued by all-india
financial institutions and mutual funds, however, increased by
rs.11,602 crore as against a decline of rs.2,805 crore in the
corresponding period of the previous year. the total flow of
resources from scbs to the commercial sector increased by
9.4 per cent (rs.1,45,355 crore) during the current year so far
as compared with the increase of 9.3 per cent (rs.1,12,148
crore) in the corresponding period of the previous year. the
year-on-year growth in resource flow was 28.4 per cent over
and above the growth of 28.1 per cent a year ago.
11.
aggregate deposits of scbs increased by rs.1,85,244
crore (8.8 per cent) in the current fiscal year up to
october 13, 2006 as compared with an increase of rs.1,15,309
crore (6.5 per cent) in the corresponding period of the previous
year. on an annual basis, the growth in aggregate deposits at
rs.3,93,849 crore (20.7 per cent) was higher than that of
rs.2,98,229 crore (18.6 per cent) a year ago. aggregate deposit
growth during 2006-07 has to be viewed in the context of several
6

favourable developments during the period, namely, improvement
in corporates’ internally generated resources placed with the
banking system, the relative attractiveness of bank deposits
vis-à-vis small savings – owing to higher interest rates on banking
deposits and extension of tax incentives for longer term deposits
(five years and above) – as well as active deposit mobilisation
strategies mounted by banks to fund the expansion in credit. on
the other hand, demand deposits, which have exhibited close
correlation with stock market activity in the recent period, have
moderated since the equity market turbulence in mid-may and
june. overall, it is useful to note that the incremental non-food
credit-deposit ratio during the current year so far, has declined
to 77.7 per cent from 105.8 per cent a year ago.
12.
scbs’ investment in government and other approved
securities at rs.46,914 crore during the current financial year up
to october 13, 2006 was higher than that of rs.3,400 crore in
the corresponding period of the previous year. adjusted for banks’
repo/reverse repo with the reserve bank under the
liquidity adjustment facility (laf), their investment in statutory
liquidity ratio (slr) securities increased by rs.30,806 crore
during 2006-07 so far as against an increase of rs.33,578 crore
a year ago. banks’ net investment in government securities as
a proportion to their aggregate deposits has been decelerating
to accommodate the demand for non-food advances. there has
also been substantial support from non-bank entities for the
market borrowing programme of central and state governments.
consequently, commercial banks’ holdings of government
and other approved securities fell to 29.8 per cent of their net
demand and time liabilities (ndtl) as on october 13, 2006 from
34.7 per cent a year ago. while these investments exceeded
the required slr by rs.1,23,010 crore (rs. 2,07,903 crore
7

a year ago), the excess slr investment adjusted for
laf holdings amounted to rs.1,04,770 crore or 4.1 per cent
of ndtl.
13.
on a year-on-year basis, the growth in money supply
(m3) at 19.0 per cent was higher than 16.8 per cent a year ago.
on a financial year basis, m3 increased by rs.2,13,891 crore
(7.8 per cent) in 2006-07 up to october 13, 2006 which was
higher than the increase of rs.1,41,555 crore (6.1 per cent) in
the corresponding period of the previous year.
14.
the year-on-year increase in reserve money was
20.4 per cent as on october 20, 2006 as compared with
14.0 per cent a year ago. on a financial year basis, reserve
money increased by rs.43,884 crore (7.7 per cent) up to october
20, 2006 as compared with the increase of rs.23,320 crore
(4.8 per cent) in the corresponding period of the previous year.
while currency in circulation increased by rs.38,262 crore
(8.9 per cent) as compared with rs.21,877 crore (5.9 per cent),
bankers’ deposits with the reserve bank increased by rs.7,047
crore (5.2 per cent) as compared with rs.3,289 crore (2.9 per
cent). among the sources of reserve money, net reserve bank’s
credit to the central government increased by rs.15,029 crore
as compared with the increase of rs.5,073 crore in the
corresponding period last year. adjusted for transactions under
the laf, net reserve bank’s credit to the central government
showed an increase of rs.6,299 crore. the reserve bank’s net
foreign exchange assets (nfea) increased by rs.77,310 crore
as against an increase of rs.25,475 crore during the
corresponding period of the previous year. nfea, adjusted for
revaluation, increased by rs.42,544 crore as compared with an
increase of rs.30,077 crore during the corresponding period of
the previous year. the ratio of nfea to currency increased
8

from 156.3 per cent on march 31 to 160.0 per cent by
october 20, 2006.
15.
while daily injections under the laf averaged rs.11,686
crore during january-march, 2006, the reserve bank absorbed
rs.51,490 crore under the laf on a daily average basis during
april-june, 2006 and rs.36,857 crore in july-september, 2006
with the absorption moderating to rs.12,956 crore in october
(up to october 27, 2006). additional liquidity amounting to
rs.12,342 crore was absorbed under the market stabilisation
scheme (mss) during 2006-07 up to october 27, 2006.
the balances under the mss increased from rs.29,000 crore
on march 31, 2006 to rs.41,342 crore by october 27, 2006. on
the other hand, the cash balances of the centre with the reserve
bank declined from an average of rs.40,981 crore during
january-march, 2006 to rs.9,569 crore in april-june, 2006 before
picking up to rs.16,029 crore in july-september, 2006 and further
to rs.27,696 crore in october, 2006 (up to october 23, 2006).
the average liquidity overhang as reflected in outstandings
under the laf, mss and surplus cash balances of the
central government, taken together, increased from rs.74,334
crore in march, 2006 to rs.89,786 crore in april-june, 2006
and further to rs.92,354 crore in july-september, 2006
before declining to rs.85,196 crore in october, 2006
(up to october 23, 2006).
16.
inflation, measured by variations in the wholesale price
index (wpi) on a year-on-year basis, eased from its recent
peak of 5.5 per cent on june 17, 2006 to 5.3 per cent by
october 14, 2006. on an average basis, annual inflation based
on the wpi was 4.5 per cent as on october 14, 2006 as
compared with 5.3 per cent a year ago.
9

17.
disaggregating the movements in year-on-year inflation,
it is observed that prices of primary articles (weight: 22.0 per cent
in the wpi basket) increased by 7.3 per cent as on october 14,
2006 as compared with an increase of 4.1 per cent a year ago.
the rise in prices of primary articles was mainly under food
articles and minerals. prices of manufactured products (weight:
63.8 per cent) increased by 4.4 per cent as compared with
2.8 per cent a year ago. in the category of manufactured
products, deceleration/decline in the prices of wood and leather
products, chemicals, basic metals and alloys, machinery and
transport equipment softened the effects of sharp increases in
the prices of paper, non-metallic mineral products, food products,
rubber and plastic products.
18.
the annual increase in prices of the ‘fuel, power, light
and lubricants’ group (weight: 14.2 per cent) at 5.2 per cent as
on october 14, 2006 was lower than 10.9 per cent a year
ago. excluding the fuel group, inflation was at 5.3 per cent
(3.1 per cent a year ago), the same as headline inflation. the
average price of the indian ‘basket’ of international crude was at
around us $ 67.9 per barrel during july-september, 2006
comparable to us $ 67.3 in april-june, 2006 but much higher
than us $ 58.5 in july-september, 2005. in the recent period,
however, there has been some easing of crude oil prices in the
international markets and the average indian basket crude price
has come down to us $ 58.9 per barrel as on october 27, 2006.
19.
on a year-on-year basis, inflation based on the consumer
price index (cpi) for urban non-manual employees, agricultural
labourers and rural labourers showed sharp increase to 6.6 per cent,
7.3 per cent and 7.0 per cent in september 2006 from
4.8 per cent, 3.2 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively, a year ago.
10

the year-on-year cpi inflation for industrial workers was also
placed far higher at 6.3 per cent in august 2006 as against
3.5 per cent a year ago. the relatively higher increase in
consumer prices vis-à-vis wpi inflation needs to be viewed in
the context of the rise in prices of food articles which have
a relatively higher weight in the cpi than in the wpi.
20.
revenue receipts of the union government as a proportion
to the budget estimates (be) improved from 23.1 per cent in
april-august, 2005 to 26.4 per cent in april-august, 2006 reflecting
both higher tax and non-tax revenue receipts. total expenditure
at 35.5 per cent of the be was higher than 33.2 per cent of the
be in april-august, 2005. non-plan expenditure at 37.4 per cent
was higher mainly on account of food and fertiliser subsidy and
increased interest payments. accordingly, as a proportion to the
be, the gross fiscal deficit (gfd) and revenue deficit increased
to 61.0 per cent and 93.7 per cent, respectively, during
april-august, 2006 as compared with 57.1 per cent and
78.0 per cent in the corresponding period last year.
21.
the gross borrowings of the central government at
rs.98,000 crore (rs.84,000 crore a year ago) through dated
securities during 2006-07 so far (up to october 27, 2006)
constituted 63.2 per cent of the be while net market borrowings
at rs.62,986 crore (rs.51,370 crore a year ago) constituted
54.3 per cent of the be. the weighted average yield and weighted
average maturity of central government securities issued during
2006-07 so far (up to end-october 2006) were 7.92 per cent
and 14.09 years, as compared with 7.34 per cent and 16.90
years, respectively, for those issued during 2005-06. all issuances
during the current financial year, except three, were reissuances
reflecting efforts towards consolidation of public debt and
imparting liquidity to the government securities market. as against
11

the provisional net allocation of rs.17,277 crore (gross rs.23,828
crore) for their market borrowing programme, the state
governments have raised a net amount of rs.3,669 crore
(gross rs.8,595 crore) up to october 27, 2006.
22.
financial markets continued to remain stable and orderly
in the second quarter of 2006-07 although interest rates have
firmed up in almost all segments. from mid-september 2006,
reduction in liquidity with the banking system on account of
sizeable tax outflows and build-up of the centre’s cash
balances was reflected in a sharp drop in the daily volumes of
funds offered at the laf auctions and transient spikes in
overnight rates. liquidity conditions improved in the subsequent
weeks with the return flow of tax collections and drawdown of
cash balances. interest rates in the call, market repo and
collateralised borrowing and lending obligations (cblo) segments
of the money market averaged 6.73 per cent, 6.40 per cent and
6.26 per cent, respectively, in october (up to october 27, 2006)
as compared with 6.58 per cent, 6.17 per cent and 6.19 per cent
in march 2006.
23.
the primary yields on 91-day treasury bills increased to
6.65 per cent on october 27, 2006 from 5.41 per cent at
end-april, 2006. yields on 364-day treasury bills recorded
a rise to 6.99 per cent up to october 27, 2006 from 5.90 per cent
at end-april, 2006. the outstanding amount of cp was rs.24,419
crore by end-september, 2006 as compared with rs.12,718
crore at end-march, 2006. the weighted average discount rate
on cp declined to 7.70 per cent from 8.59 per cent over this
period. in the market for certificates of deposit (cds), the weighted
average discount rate declined from 8.62 per cent at the end of
march, 2006 to 7.74 per cent by mid-september, accompanied
12

by an increase of 46.6 per cent in the outstanding amount
(i.e., from rs.43,568 crore to rs.63,864 crore).
24.
in the foreign exchange market, there was improvement
in activity in the spot segment from the last week of july, 2006
with two-way movements in the spot exchange rate. forward
premia increased during the second quarter of 2006-07. the
average six-month forward premium increased from 1.04 per cent
in july, 2006 to 1.51 per cent in october, 2006 (up to october
26). the turnover in the inter-bank as well as merchant segments
of the foreign exchange market during the second quarter of
2006-07 was higher than in the corresponding period of
2005-06. while the inter-bank turnover increased from us $ 234
billion (monthly average) during the second quarter of 2005-06
to us $ 339 billion in the second quarter of 2006-07, the merchant
turnover increased from us $ 94 billion to us $ 131 billion. the
ratio of inter-bank to merchant turnover was 2.6 during the second
quarter of 2006-07, the same as a year ago.
25.
the yield on government securities with one-year residual
maturity moved up from 6.20 per cent at end-april, 2006 to
7.02 per cent as on october 27, 2006. the yield on government
securities with 10-year residual maturity also firmed up from
7.39 per cent at end-april, 2006 to 7.62 per cent as on october 27,
2006. the yield on government securities with 20-year residual
maturity rose from 7.80 per cent to 7.93 per cent during the
same period. the yield spread between 10-year and one-year
government securities narrowed down from 119 basis points to
60 basis points as on october 27, 2006. the yield spread
between 20-year and one-year government securities narrowed
down from 160 basis points to 91 basis points during the
same period.
13

26.
during april-october, 2006 public sector banks (psbs)
raised their deposit rates across various maturities by 50-75
basis points. interest rates offered by psbs for deposits up to
one year maturity increased from a range of 2.25-6.50 per cent
to 2.75-7.00 per cent. similarly, deposit rates for over one
to three years maturity increased from 5.75-6.75 per cent to
6.25-7.50 per cent and, for above three years maturity, they
increased from 6.00-7.25 per cent to 6.50-8.00 per cent over the
same period. the adjustments in rates on term deposits made
by private sector banks and foreign banks were somewhat mixed.
while their maximum deposit rates increased by 50-175 basis
points, their minimum deposit rates declined by 50-150 basis
points for some maturities.
27.
the benchmark prime lending rates (bplrs) of psbs
and private sector banks increased to a range of 11.00-12.00
per cent and 11.50-15.00 per cent from 10.25-11.25 per cent
and 11.00-14.00 per cent, respectively, during april-october,
2006. the range of bplr for foreign banks remained, however,
unchanged at 10.00-14.50 per cent. during the current year, the
weighted average bplr of psbs increased from 10.71 per cent
in march to 11.18 per cent in june and further to 11.33 per cent
in september. the weighted average bplrs of private sector
banks also increased from 12.37 per cent in march to 12.80 per
cent in june and 12.89 per cent in september. the weighted
average bplrs of foreign banks remained stable at around 12.66
per cent during the period.
28.
during the second quarter of 2006-07, equity market
activity recorded a pick-up in terms of issuances in the domestic
primary segment as well as in international stock exchanges.
the bse sensex rose from 11,280 in end-march, 2006 to reach
14

a peak of 12,612 on may 10, 2006 before receding to 8,929 on
june 14, 2006. thereafter, banking on robust macroeconomic
fundamentals and high private corporate profitability, it rallied
with intermittent corrections in the successive months to reach
12,907 on october 27, 2006.
developments in the external sector
29.
balance of payments data for the first quarter of 2006-07
released at the end of september, 2006 continue to reflect
vibrancy and strength in the external sector of the economy.
merchandise export growth at 17.0 per cent was led by
manufactures such as chemicals and related products,
engineering goods including machinery and instruments, transport
equipment, manufactures of metals and petroleum products.
merchandise imports increased by 23.8 per cent mainly on
account of a growth of 44.9 per cent in oil imports on the back of
a year-on-year rise of 35.5 per cent in average international
crude prices facing india. non-oil imports excluding gold and
silver rose by 17.3 per cent during april-june, 2006 led by imports
of industrial inputs and capital goods. accordingly, on a
payments basis, the merchandise trade deficit increased
to us $ 18.5 billion during april-june, 2006 from us $ 13.6
billion in the corresponding quarter last year. the buoyancy of
software exports, remittances from indians working overseas
and various professional and business services enabled an
increase in net invisible earnings to us $ 12.4 billion from
us $ 10.0 billion a year ago. invisible payments rose by
21.9 per cent and, coupled with the wider trade deficit, resulted
in a current account deficit (cad) of us $ 6.1 billion which was
higher than the cad of us $ 3.6 billion in the corresponding
quarter a year ago.
15

30.
net capital inflows during april-june, 2006 at us $ 11.9
billion were supported by both debt and non-debt inflows. foreign
direct investment flows increased to us $ 1.7 billion from
us $ 1.2 billion a year ago. debt flows (net) in the form of
external assistance, external commercial borrowings, non-resident
deposits and short-term credit increased to us $ 5.2 billion in
april-june, 2006 from us $ 1.0 billion a year ago. while net
external commercial borrowings amounted to us $ 3.6 billion as
compared with us $ 1.1 billion a year ago, non-resident indian
(nri) deposits increased by us $ 1.2 billion in contrast to an
outflow of us $ 0.1 billion a year ago. in the wake of stock
market turbulence in may, 2006 there was a marginal outflow of
us $ 0.5 billion in portfolio investment during april-june, 2006.
31.
net accretion to foreign exchange reserves, excluding
valuation changes, amounted to us $ 6.4 billion during
april-june, 2006. valuation gains, reflecting the appreciation of
major currencies against the us dollar, accounted for a rise of
us $ 4.9 billion in total reserves as against a valuation loss of
us $ 4.3 billion in the corresponding period last year. the foreign
exchange reserves, including valuation changes, thus recorded
an increase of us $ 11.3 billion during this period as against
a decline of us $ 3.1 billion a year ago.
32.
these early developments seem to have been extended
into the second quarter of 2006-07. according to the directorate
general of commercial intelligence and statistics (dgci&s),
exports increased by 22.9 per cent in us dollar terms during
april-september, 2006 as compared with 34.1 per cent in
the corresponding period of the previous year. imports rose by
19.0 per cent as against an increase of 46.6 per cent in the
corresponding period last year. while the oil import bill increased
by 36.8 per cent, reflecting the hardening of international crude
16

oil prices (prior to the recent softening), non-oil import growth
decelerated to 11.0 per cent from 48.5 per cent in the
corresponding period last year. the slowing down of non-oil
import growth mainly reflects a sharp decline of 30.3 per cent in
imports of gold and silver during the first quarter of 2006-07 as
against an increase of 52.1 per cent a year ago. available
information for subsequent months of 2006-07 indicate that the
decline in bullion imports has continued. the overall trade deficit
during april-september, 2006 widened to us $ 24.6 billion from
us $ 22.3 billion a year ago. net fii outflows of us $ 1.8 billion
in the first quarter of 2006-07 were recouped and net inflows
amounting to us $ 1.7 billion were recorded in the second
quarter. net inflows on account of fiis continued in october.
fdi inflows rose to us $ 4.0 billion during april-august, 2006 –
nearly 62 per cent higher than the inflow registered in the
corresponding period last year. net capital flows and resilient
invisibles financed the trade deficit resulting in the foreign
exchange reserves increasing to us $ 166.2 billion on october
20, 2006 up from us $ 151.6 billion at end-march, 2006 (including
valuation effects).
33.
the indian foreign exchange market has generally
witnessed orderly conditions during the current financial year so
far with the exchange rate exhibiting two-way movements. the
exchange rate of the rupee, which was rs.44.61 per us dollar
at end-march, 2006 depreciated to rs.46.95 per us dollar by
july 19, 2006 but strengthened to rs.45.22 per us dollar
by october 27, 2006. similarly, the rupee depreciated to
rs.59.88 per euro on august 7, 2006 from rs.54.20 at
end-march, 2006 but subsequently appreciated to rs.57.34 by
october 27, 2006. overall, the rupee depreciated by 1.4 per cent
against the us dollar, by 5.5 per cent against the euro, by
17

9.0 per cent against the pound sterling and by 0.5 per cent
against the japanese yen during the current financial year so
far (up to october 27, 2006).
34.
the exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided
by the broad principles of careful monitoring and management
of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or
a pre-announced target or a band, coupled with the ability to
intervene, if and when necessary. the overall approach to the
management of india’s foreign exchange reserves takes into
account the changing composition of the balance of payments
and endeavours to reflect the ‘liquidity risks’ associated with
different types of flows and other requirements.
developments in the global economy
35.
the global economy, now in its fourth successive year of
above-average growth, appears to have maintained the pace of
its expansion in the third quarter of 2006 on top of accelerated
growth in the first half of the year. the moderation in the us
economy seems offset by stronger growth in other parts of the
world. according to the world economic outlook of the
international monetary fund (imf) released in september 2006,
global real gdp growth on a purchasing power parity basis is
expected to pick up from 4.9 per cent in 2005 to 5.1 per cent in
2006 before easing back to 4.9 per cent in 2007. based on
market exchange rates, world real gdp growth is projected to
accelerate from 3.4 per cent in 2005 to 3.8 per cent in 2006
before decelerating to 3.5 per cent in 2007.
36.
in the us, real gdp growth was 1.6 per cent in the third
quarter (july-september) as compared with 5.6 per cent and
2.6 per cent in the first and second quarters, respectively, mainly
18

indicative of a downturn affecting residential investment and
inventories along with an acceleration in imports. the cooling of
the housing market was reflected in declines in housing starts
as also in new and existing home sales and, more recently,
a fall in median house prices for the first time since 1995. the
japanese economy has been experiencing a period of sustained
expansion in recent months. there has also been a gradual
improvement in conditions for growth in the euro area. rapid
growth appears to have continued in china (10.4 per cent in the
third quarter) and india (8.9 per cent in the second quarter). the
performance of the other asian economies has remained firm.
growth has been buoyant in russia and latin america, too.
37.
the strength of the global economy over recent years
has been accompanied by upward pressure on commodity prices
till the first half of 2006. higher demand, shortages in production
due to unfavourable weather conditions in the early part of 2006
and declining inventories have tightened the overall cereal and
sugar supply-demand situation. world cereal production is
projected to decline. global wheat stocks are at their lowest
level in 25 years owing to drought conditions in major producing
areas. higher agricultural product prices are expected to result
in an increase of over 2 per cent in the world food import bill
in 2006. metal prices have ruled firm since 2004, rising by
45.5 per cent during the first nine months of 2006 on top of an
increase of 36.2 per cent in 2005. in the wake of the slowdown
in the us, prices of these commodities have undergone some
correction in recent weeks. industrial metal prices have tended
to decline, but dwindling stockpiles and firm demand have
provided resistance.
38.
crude oil prices, which increased from around us $ 60
per barrel at the start of the year to reach record highs above
19

us $ 78 in july and august, eased in september and october
due to large us fuel inventories, signs of slowing us economic
growth, a calmer atlantic hurricane season and forecasts of
a mild winter. petroleum product prices have also undergone
some softening with nymex gasoline futures down by a third.
the international energy agency has revised down its forecast
for growth in world oil demand for 2006 and increased its
forecast for oil production for 2007. the west texas intermediate
(wti) crude oil spot price is projected to average around
$ 66 per barrel in 2007. gold prices have also witnessed a
correction of about 18 per cent from a 26-year peak reached in
the first half of 2006, due to a sharp fall in jewellery fabrication.
39.
in the us, consumer prices declined from 4.1 per cent in
july to 3.8 per cent in august and further to 2.1 per cent in
september, 2006. in the euro area, inflation declined
from 2.5 per cent during may-june to 1.8 per cent in september.
consumer prices increased moderately in japan, i.e., by
0.6 per cent in september. in the uk, though, inflation breached
the bank of england’s target of 2.0 per cent in may and rose
from 2.4 per cent in july to 2.5 per cent in august before
decelerating to 2.4 per cent in september.
40.
globally, financial markets have been re-pricing risks in
the aftermath of the sharp decline in several asset markets in
may-june including, in particular, emerging markets. there has
been a resilient recovery in global equity markets with the dow
jones industrial average having risen to an all-time high on
october 25, 2006. investor optimism seems to have returned to
most equity markets across the world, more significantly, to the
emerging markets. the us yield curve remains inverted, reflected
in a fall in 10-year bond yields from 5.22 per cent in early july to
20

4.88 per cent on october 27, 2006. in the eurozone, 10-year
bond yields have fallen from 4.19 per cent in early july to
4.0 per cent, even though the european central bank (ecb) is
widely expected to raise rates further before the end of the year.
japanese 10-year bond yields have declined from 1.97 per cent
in early july to 1.70 per cent. the us dollar depreciated against
most major currencies in july and august, but recovered to
appreciate marginally by october. in credit markets, spreads on
emerging-market and corporate debt, which had widened in
may-june, narrowed to all-time lows in september, following
several sovereign rating upgrades.
41.
the pass-through of international crude prices to domestic
retail prices has been varied across countries while inflation
expectations have remained firm. these factors have been
reflected in monetary policy responses. most central banks have
been increasing policy rates but there is, in some cases, evidence
of a pause, notably in the us. the federal reserve, which had
been increasing its target rate (by 25 basis points each on
seventeen occasions from june, 2004 to 5.25 per cent by june,
2006), paused in august-october, 2006. other central banks
that have kept their policy rates steady since july include the
bank of japan (uncollateralised overnight rate to 0.25 per cent
in july, 2006 after maintaining a zero interest rate policy since
2001); the bank of canada (by 50 basis points in april-may,
2006 to 4.25 per cent); bank negara malaysia (policy rate at
3.5 per cent since april, 2006); the bank of thailand (the 14-day
repurchase rate at 5.00 per cent since june, 2006); the monetary
authority of singapore; and the banco central de chile
(benchmark lending rate raised to 5.25 per cent in july, 2006);
the banco de mexico (benchmark overnight lending rate at
7.0 per cent since april, 2006). in turkey, policy rates which
21

were raised by 425–625 basis points in june-july, 2006 were
kept unchanged subsequently.
42.
the ecb raised its policy rates five times since december,
2005 by 25 basis points each to 3.25 per cent; the bank of
england (which had raised its policy rate in august, 2006 by 25
basis points to 4.75 per cent, for the first time since august,
2005); the reserve bank of australia (by 25 basis points in
august, 2006 to 6.0 per cent); the people’s bank of china
(lending rate raised by 0.27 percentage points to 6.12 per cent
on august 18, 2006; required reserve ratio by 50 basis points on
july 5 to 8.0 per cent and a further increase of 50 basis points
effective from august 15, 2006); and the bank of korea (by 25
basis points to 4.50 per cent on august 10).
43.
a few central banks have eased monetary policy in the
recent period such as bank indonesia (reduced its policy rate
from 12.50 per cent to 10.75 per cent on october 5, 2006); and
the banco central do brasil (cut selic rate target gradually from
september 2005 to 13.75 per cent by october 2006).
overall assessment
44.
in the indian economy, aggregate supply conditions appear
to have strengthened in the first half of 2006-07, invigorated by
the pick-up in activity in all constituent sectors of the economy.
while growth in agriculture in the first quarter seems to have
benefited mainly from the rabi season of 2005-06 (which came
to a close in june 2006), the prospects for agriculture in the rest
of 2006-07 seem to have improved. hence, a resumption of
trend growth in agriculture appears realisable for the current
year, despite some setbacks on account of floods in various
22

parts of the country and somewhat deficient rainfall in foodgrains
growing areas.
45.
industrial production appears to be performing better than
consensus expectations, propelled by growth in manufacturing
which touched a ten-year high in april-august, 2006.
the industrial climate is characterised by buoyant corporate
sales/profitability and record tax collections. this is supported
by the strength of domestic and export demand, resilient business
confidence and improvement in financing conditions, particularly
in sustained growth in bank credit. the momentum of industrial
activity, if sustained, is likely to impart an upside bias to
expectations of overall macroeconomic performance.
46.
lead indicators point to continued bright prospects for
growth in services. there has been a sustained improvement in
railway revenue earnings in freight traffic and in import/export
cargo handled by civil aviation. foreign tourist arrivals as well as
passengers handled at domestic air terminals have recorded
increases during the first half of 2006-07. furthermore, there
has been a noticeable addition to switching capacity under
both telephone and cell phone connections. accordingly, all
sub-sectors under services, which account for about 70 per cent
of overall gdp growth, display dynamism.
47.
turning to aggregate demand conditions, there seems to
be some evidence of pressures firming up in the form of high
growth in capital goods output, an upturn in investment in
infrastructure and a quickening of the capital expenditure cycle.
there are indications that strengthening investment demand is
beginning to drive the economy. more importantly, consumption
demand, which accounts for over two-thirds of aggregate
domestic demand, also seems to be gathering strength. this is
23

evident from high retail credit and double-digit growth in
the production of consumer durables in the first five months of
2006-07. consumer non-durables have shed their earlier
sluggishness and picked up in july and august. demand
pressures are also visible in the expansion of money supply and
reserve money which has been sizeably higher than anticipated.
48.
the demand for bank credit has been growing at above
30 per cent for the third year in succession. available information
points to high growth in credit extended by banks to fast growing
sectors such as housing, commercial real estate and retail loans.
asset prices remain at elevated levels and current levels of
commodity prices make an overall assessment a complex task.
49.
against this background, it is critical to be watchful for
early signs of overheating. an overheating economy is one which
is growing rapidly and its productive capacity cannot keep up
with resulting demand pressures. emergence of inflationary
pressures is usually seen as the first indication of overheating.
in this context, policy makers keenly analyse the behaviour of
the output gap, i.e., the excess of current output over potential
or full capacity output. in the context of setting monetary policy,
judging how close an economy is to operating at full capacity is
crucial. if the monetary authority senses that there is unutilised
capacity, the increase in demand generated by growth can be
accommodated without inflationary pressures and, therefore, the
need to act against overheating may not arise. on the other
hand, if demand is running ahead of full capacity, there is
a case for tightening of monetary policy with a view to slowing
down the economy and heading off overheating.
50.
globally, there seems to be increasing difficulty in
identifying the symptoms of overheating. there is some evidence
24

of a blurring of the relationship between output gaps and inflation.
moreover, the size and direction of an economy’s potential output
is becoming increasingly difficult to diagnose. in particular,
globalisation has expanded the supply potential of various
economies, especially emerging economies. in the recent period,
it appears that the current positive supply shock has made the
concept of potential output fuzzier than in the past. for
a developing economy like india, the concept of overheating is
less of a guide for monetary policy than in advanced economies
on account of the existence of large unemployment/
underemployment of resources and the absence of a clear
assessment of potential output. furthermore, it is difficult to obtain
a clear judgement of potential output in an economy that is
undergoing structural transformation. nevertheless, recent
developments, in particular, the combination of high growth and
consumer inflation coupled with escalating asset prices and
tightening infrastructural bottlenecks underscore the need to
reckon with dangers of overheating and the implications for the
timing and direction of monetary policy setting. while there is no
conclusive evidence of overheating in the indian economy at the
current juncture, the criticality of monitoring all available
indications that point to excess aggregate demand is perhaps
more relevant now than ever before.
51.
monetary policy operates with lags that can be long and
variable, depending on the specifics of the country situation. it is
in this context that the setting of monetary policy is required to
be forward looking with the full impact of current policy actions
coming into play 12 to 18 months later. in india, the key policy
signalling rates embodied in the laf repo/reverse repo rates
have been raised since october, 2004 by a cumulative 100/150
basis points, supported by a 50 basis points increase in the crr.
25

this calibrated withdrawal of accommodation is in the process
of working itself through the various sectors of the economy.
hence, in addition to current signs of demand pressures, the
evolution of demand conditions in the next few months is critical
for considering the possible emergence of overheating, if any,
with concurrent implications for both price and financial stability.
52.
in the domestic financial markets, there seems to be some
evidence of moderation in volatility in the second quarter of
2006-07 within an overall re-pricing of risks. money markets
continue to be characterised by conditions of excess liquidity,
interrupted by brief spells of temporary tightness in the second
half of september on account of advance direct tax outflows
and balance sheet requirements. short-term rates have generally
evolved in alignment with policy rates and have responded
favourably to the policy stance in june and july. in the foreign
exchange market, the exchange rate of the rupee has exhibited
two-way movements. since end-july, however, the market
sentiment has turned upbeat, mirrored in a modest nominal
appreciation. in the government securities market, yields have
come off mid-july highs and have corrected substantially.
53.
inflationary pressures, as exhibited in wholesale and
consumer prices warrant continued special focus. despite recent
easing, it will be prudent to presume that oil prices at current
levels may still contain some elements of a ‘permanent’
component which is yet to be matched by full pass-through.
hence, the possible risks for inflation in the months ahead need
to be viewed against this background. it is desirable to watch for
incipient pressures building up on prices of manufactures with
the quickening of domestic industrial activity and the elevated
levels of international commodity prices. it is also necessary to
26

monitor the seasonal movements in prices of food articles in the
remaining part of the year, given their criticality for inflation
perceptions and consequently, inflation expectations. in the
months ahead, it is difficult to assess whether productivity gains
and competitive conditions will be able to head off the squeeze
on margins that seems to be setting in. furthermore, it is possible
to hold that positive base effects that have couched the impact
of upside pressures on price changes so far would wear off
and this could amplify measured inflation towards the close
of 2006-07.
54.
fiscal spending has picked up in the first five months of
2006-07 and the centre’s gross fiscal deficit has been running
higher on an annual basis in relation to budget estimates. the
buoyancy in tax revenues may, however, mitigate the
expansionary impact if it gets entrenched in the remaining months
of the year. consumer prices for all categories have been rising
through the first half of 2006-07, reflecting the impact of
heightened primary product prices, including those of essential
commodities. the wedge between consumer prices and
wholesale prices remains larger than before. while a combination
of fiscal and monetary measures seems to have reinforced each
other and helped to mitigate the inflationary risks, there are
reasons to be vigilant on this front. in particular, looking ahead,
it may be appropriate to hold that the outlook for inflation in
india is more likely to be driven by demand conditions rather
than by the strong positive supply-side effects noticed in the
recent past.
55.
in an economy-wide sense, the faster growth of aggregate
demand relative to aggregate supply during 2006-07 has begun
to be manifested, to some extent, in the external sector.
27

the merchandise trade deficit and the current account deficit
have expanded despite buoyant export growth and some
moderation in the growth of non-oil imports. so far, the high
prices of international crude seem to have been driving the
widening of the trade deficit. softening of these prices in the
months ahead could offset such pressures. merchandise export
growth has remained reasonably strong. gross invisible earnings
have expanded rapidly in recent years and are poised to equal
merchandise exports. fast growth in earnings from travel,
software and other business service exports has complemented
the stable support from inward remittances which is being
increasingly regarded as a ‘permanent’ component of india’s
external balance sheet. capital flows seem to have recovered
from the turbulence of may-june and have resumed strongly
with debt flows in april-june, 2006 increasing to us $ 5.2 billion
from us 1.0 billion a year ago. on the whole, it is reasonable to
expect that, as in the recent past, capital flows will enable
financing of the current account deficit and some continuing
accretion to the level of foreign exchange reserves.
56.
in recent months, there are some indications of a shift in
the patterns of global growth. first, the us economy, which has
powered the recent phase of global expansion, seems to be
beginning to slow, driven down primarily by the contracting
housing market. second, activity appears to have gathered
momentum in the euro area and japan but it is unclear as to
whether or not this recovery is self-sustained. third, the onus for
sustaining global growth seems to be shifting to the emerging
economies, particularly low per capita income countries. financial
upheavals right up to may-june this year are a reminder that
market conditions in emerging economies have been relatively
volatile in response to exogenous developments. fourth, shifts
28

in the pattern of international trade are also discernible. china’s
rising importance has been paralleled by a reduced reliance of
major emerging economies on the us as an important export
destination.
57.
globally, inflation risks remain, though incipient at the
current juncture. while headline inflation rates are moderating,
core inflation, especially in the us, has remained firm, indicating
that upside pressures from oil and commodity prices persist
across advanced and emerging economies, especially at the
producer level. potential risks from the possible full indirect effects
of elevated and uncertain oil/commodity prices, some possible
tightening of global production capacities and the remaining
overhang of global liquidity continue to weigh upon the setting of
monetary policy worldwide. there are also signs of wage
pressures setting in. while some deceleration in economic activity
in recent months seems to have induced a pause in the policy
tightening cycle of several important central banks, the persistent
threats of inflation constrain monetary authorities from possible
moves towards a more neutral stance in an aggressive fashion.
58.
global imbalances have continued to widen during 2006.
with some central banks actively reassessing their stance now,
the potential drainage of global liquidity would test the resilience
of world financial markets and weigh upon the outlook on the
global economy. globally, the concerns are not about the
existence of current account deficits or surpluses per se, but the
persistence of large deficits and surpluses, particularly in large
and systemically important economies. it is in this context that
the imf’s projection of the u.s. current account deficit at about
7 per cent of gdp in 2007 with large surpluses continuing in
japan, emerging asia and oil-exporting countries is disturbing.
29

the sharp rise in the net foreign liability position of the us
raises the risks of abrupt and disorderly adjustment of major
currencies as the global imbalances unwind. however, there is
an interesting lull in the serious concerns expressed both by
policy makers and financial markets in regard to the global
imbalances, possibly on the assumption that universal recognition
of the problem would per se lead to harmonised actions that
would avoid hard landing.
59.
global financial markets have revised expectations in
response to the changes in the magnitude and pace of monetary
tightening between june and september, 2006. in the money
markets, there appear to be widening expectations that, at best,
interest rates are expected to rise only gradually from now on.
on the other hand, these revisions in expectations have coincided
with falling long-term interest rates in the us, the euro area and
japan leading to inversion/flattening of yield curves. global equity
markets have recovered some of the losses suffered in may and
june with those markets that recorded the largest losses gaining
the most. spreads in corporate credit markets have remained
tight, broadly unchanged from late june. a boom in global
mergers and acquisitions has been underway and has been
financed, to some extent, by increased leverage. changes in
expected short-term interest rate differentials have emerged as
important drivers of foreign exchange markets, enabling
a moderate strengthening of the euro. the yen’s role as a funding
currency for carry trades remains significant. the pound sterling
has strengthened in the wake of the increase in the policy rate
by the bank of england. currencies of emerging economies
have benefited from a reversal of may-june portfolio outflows.
renewed strength in commodity prices has also played a role in
foreign exchange markets. nevertheless, geopolitical risks remain
30

a key factor in determining the evolution of major currency
movements. it is also important to recognise the potential risks
emanating from the possible moderation of liquidity and oil
surpluses on account of the impact of monetary policy action as
well as the likelihood of the ebbing of oil prices.
60.
credit markets, particularly in developing countries, have
been experiencing heightened activity since 2004. during 2006,
there seems to be growing evidence that a synchronised upswing
in bank credit is taking hold across emerging economies in asia
and latin america in an environment of strong growth and excess
liquidity in banking systems. this recent surge is accompanied
by compositional shifts on the assets side of banks’ portfolios.
households, not corporates – historically the most important
borrowers from banks – have absorbed a significant portion of
the credit growth. there seem to be some risks to sustainability
of the recent rapid pace of bank credit growth to households.
first, households could become overextended as reflected in
credit card busts in several emerging economies. second, large
accumulation of debt could leave households prone to future
interest rate/exchange rate shocks since banks have, in effect,
transferred a large part of their market risks to households.
third, excessive reliance on debt-financed consumption could
turn out to be a serious problem if refinancing options dry up.
fourth, moral hazard and adverse selection is a constant
challenge facing banks. fifth, housing markets continue to remain
overheated and, therefore, a source of risk.
61.
in the overall assessment, while global growth has been
strong and broad-based, there seem to be some indications of
moderation in recent months. there are also perceptions of
risks to growth from the cooling of the housing market in the us
and the potential drainage of liquidity from financial markets.
31

while global inflation conditions have not worsened, concerns
relating to potential price pressures persist, particularly in the
context of the firming up of food and metal prices, the uncertainty
surrounding international crude prices and the monetary
overhang. while geopolitical risks continue to cast a shadow,
it is necessary to recognise that global risks have not changed
significantly from the time of the first quarter review of
july, 2006. domestic developments exhibit strength and resilience
with some downside risks. there is a pick-up in the momentum
of growth which also appears to be spreading across all
constituent sectors of the economy. domestic financial markets
have exhibited stable and orderly conditions. in the external
sector, there are signs of abiding strength and the current account
deficit has been well-managed so far. on the other hand, there
are indications of growing demand pressures and potential risks
from rapid credit growth and strains on credit quality. high levels
of monetary expansion and the evolution of the liquidity situation
will need to be continuously monitored for any signs of risks to
inflation. the elevated levels of asset prices also represent
a risk to the outlook for macroeconomic and financial stability. in
brief, at the current juncture, for policy purposes, the two major
issues that exert conflicting pulls are exploration of signs of
overheating firming up to warrant a policy response, and, the
impact of lagged effects of earlier policy action on the evolution
of macroeconomic developments.

32

ii. stance of monetary policy for the
second half of 2006-07
62.
the first quarter review of july, 2006 noted that the
global growth outlook has brightened and the prospects of
sustaining high growth in india appear favourable with inflationary
pressures contained. nevertheless, the first quarter review
pointed to demand pressures continuing to be in evidence within
the domestic economy and that it is critical that inflationary
expectations are anchored for supporting economic growth and
financial stability. accordingly, while reiterating the stance of the
annual policy statement for 2006-07 of being in readiness to
meet the challenges posed by the unfolding of various risks, the
first quarter review sought to ensure a monetary and interest
rate environment that enables continuation of the growth
momentum while emphasising price stability with a view to
anchoring inflation expectations. the focus on credit quality and
financial market conditions for maintaining macroeconomic and,
in particular, financial stability was reinforced while supporting
export and investment demand in the economy. in response to
the evolution of macroeconomic and overall monetary conditions,
a modest pre-emptive action was considered appropriate.
the fixed reverse repo/repo rates under the laf were
raised by 25 basis points each with immediate effect on
july 25, 2006 while retaining the spread between the reverse
repo rate and the repo rate at 100 basis points. the first quarter
review also committed the reserve bank to consider measures
as appropriate to the evolving global and domestic circumstances
impinging on inflation expectations and the growth momentum.
63.
the course of macroeconomic and financial developments
in the ensuing months has shown that the monetary policy stance
33

was appropriate. first, recent macroeconomic performance has
been impressive in terms of the first half-year growth record,
justifying the relatively higher weight assigned to sustaining the
growth momentum in the stance set out in the first quarter
review of july, 2006. this positive development seems to be
reviving expectations of a structural upward shift in the mediumterm growth path of the economy, as alluded to in the
annual policy statement of april, 2006. second, the acceleration
of growth and its widening ambit has been enabled by an
environment of moderate inflation and reasonable financial
stability. third, inflation expectations have remained
well-anchored around the policy threshold, drawing confidence
from the combination of fiscal and monetary measures recently
undertaken. fourth, financial markets have responded to
monetary policy signals. long-term rates, in particular, have
moderated sizeably, flattening the yield curve and a general
revival of positive sentiment seems to be pervading all segments
of the market continuum. fifth, trade and current account deficits
have been accommodated by continued net capital inflows.
64.
the annual policy statement for 2006-07 and
subsequently, the first quarter review emphasised the need to
ensure the quality of bank credit in the context of financial stability.
it is important to reiterate these concerns, particularly in the
context of preserving the recent gains in macroeconomic
performance and productivity. diligent monitoring of the health
of credit portfolios would lead to reduction in non-performing
assets, economy in the requirements of regulatory capital and,
therefore, a greater freeing up of resources resulting in
augmenting the ability of banks to expand lending further. banks
need to recognise this cycle in the monitoring of their loan
portfolios.
34

65.
as per current indications, real gdp originating in
agriculture is poised to maintain trend growth of 3.0 per cent.
the overall industrial outlook has improved in relation to the
assessment made in july and services sector growth is expected
to sustain its momentum. overall, for policy purposes, the forecast
for gdp growth may be placed at around 8.0 per cent during
2006-07 as compared with the range of 7.5-8.0 per cent projected
in the annual policy statement and the first quarter review.
66.
inflation conditions so far have been as per expectations.
globally, however, there are incipient pressures on prices of
cereals, sugar and pulses in addition to metals. crude prices
have moderated but remain at elevated levels with an uncertain
outlook. observers note the possible elevation of capacity
utilisation levels in industries globally. in the domestic economy,
the major source of pressure has been from prices of primary
products. while some seasonal correction in prices of food articles
is possible during the remaining part of the year, policy
intervention may be expected in terms of active supply
management such as enhanced procurement and effective
distribution through the public distribution system. on the demand
side also, there are some indications of pressures and
possible spillover into inflation expectations. accordingly,
containing the year-on-year inflation rate for 2006-07 in the range
of 5.0-5.5 per cent assumes policy priority in terms of watchful
monitoring and appropriate policy responses.
67.
monetary and credit aggregates seem to be mirroring the
accelerated pace of overall economic activity during the current
year. recognition of this pick-up in momentum is reflected in the
upward revision of the forecast for real gdp growth in 2006-07
relative to the projections made in the annual policy statement
of april 2006 and the first quarter review. the expansion in
35

money supply above indicative projections in the recent period
is, to some extent, being driven by the high growth in bank
credit. there seems to be anecdotal evidence of ongoing
expansion in productive capacity which is perhaps muting
inflationary pressures that are traditionally associated with high
monetary expansion. moreover, credit penetration in india
remains low, even by emerging economy standards, and the
growing financial intermediation is possibly being reflected in
monetary and credit aggregates in a manner that standard
approaches fail to capture. there is also empirical evidence of a
structural break in the evolution of the elasticity of bank credit
with respect to output, with an upward shift since the end of the
1990s. faster growth in credit demand is being supported by a
wider dispersal across sectors, and particularly towards
households. these factors complicate the assessment of the
extent of excess demand pressures.
68.
the expansion in m3 was projected at around 15.0 per cent
for 2006-07 in the annual policy statement. the growth in
aggregate deposits was projected at around rs.3,30,000 crore
in 2006-07. non-food bank credit including investments in
bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and
private corporate sector and cp was expected to increase by
around 20 per cent. by current indications, the growth in monetary
and credit aggregates is now expected to be somewhat higher
than the initial indicative projections. it is, however, important to
reiterate the concerns expressed in the first quarter review
and take careful note of the higher expansion in money supply,
deposits and credit while assessing liquidity conditions.
69.
in brief, recent global developments and the outlook
do not provide any definitive indication for further monetary policy
36

action. hence, the increasing importance of global factors, by
itself, would not warrant any change in the policy stance at this
stage, though the evolving monetary policy actions of major
economies need to be watched. in the domestic economy, there
are signs of demand pressures in addition to possible transient
supply constraints in respect of primary commodities. it is also
possible to argue that lagged effects of monetary policy actions
would influence the future path of output and prices in the desired
direction. while there is no conclusive evidence of overheating,
and though traditional indicators may overestimate demand
pressures, it will be risky to ignore the prevalence and relevance
of these factors. furthermore, containing inflation expectations
in the current environment and consolidating gains achieved
so far in regard to stability would warrant appropriate, immediate
measures and willingness to take recourse to all possible
measures in response to evolving circumstances promptly.
the objective is to continue to maintain conditions of stability
that contribute to sustaining the momentum of growth on an
enduring basis. towards this objective, the monetary policy
stance and measures will need to be in a process of careful
rebalancing and timely adjustment.
70.
the reserve bank will ensure that appropriate liquidity is
maintained in the system so that all legitimate requirements of
credit are met, particularly for productive purposes, consistent
with the objective of price and financial stability. towards this
end, the reserve bank will continue with its policy of active
demand management of liquidity through open market operations
(omo) including the mss, laf and crr, and using all the
policy instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the
situation warrants.
37

71.
in sum, barring the emergence of any adverse and
unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy
and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy
including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary
policy in the period ahead will be:
•

to ensure a monetary and interest rate environment
that supports export and investment demand in
the economy so as to enable continuation of the
growth momentum while reinforcing price stability
with a view to anchoring inflation expectations.

•

to maintain the emphasis on macroeconomic and,
in particular, financial stability.

•

to consider promptly all possible measures as
appropriate to the evolving global and domestic
situation.

38

iii. monetary measures
(a)
72.

bank rate

the bank rate has been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent.

(b)

reverse repo rate/repo rate

73.
it is considered desirable to keep the reverse repo rate
under the laf unchanged at 6.0 per cent.
74.
in view of the current macroeconomic and overall monetary
conditions, it has been decided to increase the fixed repo
rate under the laf by 25 basis points from 7.0 per cent to
7.25 per cent with immediate effect.
75.
the reserve bank retains the option to conduct overnight
repo or longer term repo under the laf depending on market
conditions and other relevant factors. the reserve bank will
continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or
reject tender(s) under the laf, wholly or partially, if deemed fit,
so as to make efficient use of the laf in daily liquidity
management.

(c)

cash reserve ratio

76.
the cash reserve ratio (crr) of scheduled banks is
currently at 5.0 per cent. on a review of the current liquidity
situation, it is felt desirable to keep the present level of
crr at 5.0 per cent unchanged.
third quarter review
77.
the third quarter review of the annual statement on
monetary policy will be undertaken on tuesday, january 30, 2007.
39

part ii. mid-term review of annual statement
on developmental and regulatory policies
for the year 2006-07
78.
financial stability has assumed priority in the hierarchy of
objectives of the reserve bank in the context of elevated asset
prices, rapid growth in bank credit and heightened appetite for
risk in an environment of ample liquidity despite sizeable
re-pricing of risks in more recent months. accordingly, the quality
of financial assets and the state of financial market conditions
have also become important concerns in the formulation and
setting of monetary policy. the annual policy statement of april
2006 emphasised financial stability in its stance and sought to
draw upon the strong complementarity between macroeconomic
and financial stability. it noted that separate coverage of
monetary, and developmental and regulatory policies enhances
clarity and transparency in communication; yet, it observed, it is
important to adopt a holistic approach that exploits the synergies
between the responsibility for price and financial stability and
regulatory policies in order to secure high growth with stability.
keeping in view the overall macroeconomic conditions and the
possibilities of global risk factors materialising, the annual policy
statement strengthened prudential norms in the sectors recording
high credit growth. banks were provided with additional avenues
for raising capital through innovative instruments to augment
their capital base. banks were also encouraged to undertake
sound stress testing practices for assessment of capital
adequacy. the first quarter review of july, 2006 urged banks
to focus on mobilisation of retail deposits, stricter credit appraisals
on sectoral basis, and to ensure the health of credit portfolios
on an enduring basis. it retained and reinforced the emphasis
on financial stability set out in the annual policy statement.
40

79.
it has been the endeavour of the reserve bank to develop
sound and efficient intermediaries and markets so as to provide
foundations for a robust, efficient and diversified financial system,
a key requisite for effective transmission of monetary policy.
efforts are being made to evolve a system that will detect sources
of vulnerability early and trigger corrective strategies. in this
context, the importance of communication has increased and
the reserve bank has adopted a participative and consultative
process in the conduct of its developmental and regulatory
policies. the process is becoming broad-based with wider
involvement of all stakeholders and emphasis on financial
inclusion as well as financial education. it is not just confined to
transparency but also encompasses financial education that
should foster a more informed evaluation of policies.
80.
the main focus of the mid-term review is on select areas.
first, it is proposed to further develop and integrate financial
markets with a view to enhancing allocative efficiency. second,
ongoing efforts to improve and expand credit delivery would be
oriented towards financial inclusion and extension of financial
services to the under-privileged segments of the population.
third, strengthening the capital base of banks with a view to
preparing them to migrate to basel ii norms, putting in place the
appropriate financial architecture for risk management and
implementing prudential measures in consonance with
international best practices in the financial sector continues to
assume high priority. fourth, consistent with the sweeping
changes in india and the global economy in the recent period,
the pace of gradual liberalisation of the external sector needs to
be kept up within the framework for fuller capital account
convertibility recommended by the committee appointed by the
reserve bank with the objectives of promoting economic growth,
41

improving financial sector efficiency and providing opportunities
for diversification of investments by residents.
81.
the mid-term review of developmental and regulatory
policies for the year 2006-07 is divided into four sections:
i. financial markets; ii. credit delivery mechanism and other
banking services; iii. prudential measures; and iv. institutional
developments.

i. financial markets
82.
the reserve bank continues its efforts to develop various
segments of financial markets in terms of operational flexibility,
transparency and institutional structure. concomitantly, orderly
functioning and preservation of soundness of the market
segments are ensured through effective monitoring and
regulation.
83.
the technical advisory committee (tac) on money,
foreign exchange and government securities markets has
provided valuable guidance to the reserve bank in the context
of its developmental role vis-à-vis financial markets. the reserve
bank reconstituted the tac on money, foreign exchange and
government securities markets in june, 2006. the tac would
meet as often as it is required but at least once in a quarter,
to review and recommend measures for deepening and widening
the money, foreign exchange and government securities markets
including those relating to participants, products, institutional and
infrastructural arrangements.
money market
84.
a number of measures have been undertaken in 2006-07
with a view to improving the functioning of various segments of
42

the money market and enhancing smooth flow of funds across
instruments and participants. these measures are intended to
fortify the institutional architecture for the smooth play of money
markets.

nds-call
85.
in pursuance of the announcement made in the annual
policy statement of april, 2006 a screen-based negotiated
quote-driven system for all dealings in call/notice and term money
market (nds-call) was operationalised with effect from
september 18, 2006. the system has been developed by the
clearing corporation of india ltd. (ccil) and is expected to
improve ease of transactions and bring about greater
transparency and efficient price discovery.
government securities market
86.
the implementation of the fiscal responsibility and
budget management (frbm) act has necessitated several
structural and developmental measures for the government
securities market to prepare it for the withdrawal of the reserve
bank from the primary segment.

(a) ‘when issued’ market for fresh issuance of
securities: extension
87.
as indicated in the annual policy statement of april, 2006
a ‘when issued’ (wi) market in government securities was
introduced and trading in this market has commenced from
august, 2006. to begin with, wi trading has been permitted in
reissuable securities. it is now proposed:
•

to extend ‘when issued’ trading in the case of
fresh issues of central government securities on a
selective basis.
43

(b) allowing short sale beyond intra-day
settlement cycle
88.
on the basis of the recommendations of the technical
group on the central government securities market, intra-day
short-selling in central government securities was permitted in
february, 2006. on an assessment of the market feedback, it is
now proposed:
•

to allow eligible participants, viz. , scheduled
commercial banks (scbs) and primary dealers (pds)
to cover their short positions within an extended period
of five trading days.

89.
as this arrangement may result in carrying short positions
across settlement cycles, the participants would be allowed
to deliver a shorted security by borrowing it through the
repo market.

(c) consolidation of central government securities
90.
the annual policy statement of april, 2006 stated that
there is a need to enlarge the number of actively traded central
government securities in order to enhance liquidity and improve
pricing in the market. the modalities of consolidation are being
worked out in consultation with the government of india.
foreign exchange market
91.
the reserve bank has taken several initiatives to liberalise
the conduct of foreign exchange business. a key consideration
has been the rationalisation and simplification of procedures
with a view to facilitating prompt and efficient customer service
in external transactions.
44

(a) follow-up of recommendations of the committee
on fuller capital account convertibility
92.
the reserve bank, in consultation with the government
of india, had appointed a committee on fuller capital account
convertibility (fcac) (chairman: shri s.s. tarapore) on march
20, 2006. the committee submitted its report to the reserve
bank in july, 2006 which has been placed on the reserve
bank’s website. keeping in view the recommendations of the
committee, the following measures are proposed:

(i)

setting up of internal task force for procedural
rationalisation and simplification

93.
the reserve bank has constituted an internal task force
to review the exchange and payments regime. the task force
has suggested some rationalisation and procedural simplifications
in areas related to trade and miscellaneous remittances and,
accordingly, a circular is being issued separately.

(ii) liberalised remittance scheme:
enhancement of limit
94.
resident individuals would henceforth be free to remit up
to us $ 50,000 per financial year for any current or capital
account transaction or a combination of both, as against the
earlier limit of us $ 25,000. the existing facilities for gifts,
donations and investment by resident individuals in overseas
companies would be subsumed under this revised limit.
the existing facility for private travel up to us $ 10,000 per
financial year will continue to be available on a self-declaration
basis.
45

(iii) exchange earners’ foreign currency
accounts: liberalisation
95.
all categories of foreign exchange earners may henceforth
retain up to 100 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings in
their exchange earners’ foreign currency (eefc) accounts
with a view to providing the facility uniformly to all eligible
residents.

(iv) project and service exports: liberalised
procedures
96.
with a view to facilitating project exporters and exporters
of services and providing greater flexibility in conducting their
overseas transactions, it is proposed that:
•

large turnkey/project exporters/service exporters with
satisfactory track record may operate one foreign
currency account with inter-project transferability of
funds/machinery in any country, subject to specified
reporting requirements;

•

large turnkey/project exporters/service exporters with
good track record may deploy their temporary cash
surpluses either in investments in short-term
bank deposits or aaa-rated short-term paper
abroad, subject to monitoring by the authorised dealer
bank(s); and

•

the stipulation regarding recovery of market value of
machinery from the transferee project is withdrawn;
however, such transfer of machinery should
be reported to and monitored by the authorised
dealer bank(s)/approving authority.
46

(v) banks’ borrowings from overseas: enhancement
97.
with a view to providing further flexibility to authorised
dealer banks in seeking access to funds overseas, the following
liberalisation is proposed:
•

authorised dealer banks may henceforth borrow funds
from their overseas branches and correspondent
banks (including borrowings for financing export credit,
ecbs and overdrafts from their head office/nostro
account) up to a limit of 50 per cent of their unimpaired
tier i capital or us $ 10 million, whichever is higher,
as against the earlier overall limit of 25 per cent
(excluding borrowings for financing export credit).
short-term borrowings up to a period of one year or
less, however, should not exceed 20 per cent of
unimpaired tier i capital within the overall limit of
50 per cent;

•

all borrowings in the form of subordinated debt placed
by head offices of foreign banks with their branches
in india as tier ii capital, capital funds raised/
augmented by issue of innovative perpetual debt
instruments (ipdi) and other overseas borrowing
with the specific approval of the reserve bank
would, however, continue to be outside the limit of
50 per cent; and

•

in order to phase in these limits in a non-disruptive
manner, banks whose overseas borrowings exceed
the revised prudential limit may approach the reserve
bank with a proposed road-map for complying with
these limits.
47

(vi) external commercial borrowings:
increased access
98.
borrowers currently eligible for accessing external
commercial borrowings (ecbs) can avail of an additional amount
of us $ 250 million with average maturity of more than 10 years
under the approval route, over and above the existing limit of
us $ 500 million under the automatic route, during a financial
year. other ecb criteria such as end-use, all-in-cost ceiling,
recognised lender and the like would continue to apply.
prepayment and call/put options, however, would not be
permissible for such ecbs up to a period of 10 years.
99.
with a view to providing greater flexibility to the corporates
in managing their liquidity and interest costs, prepayment
of ecb up to us $ 300 million, as against the earlier limit of
us $ 200 million, will now be allowed by authorised dealer
banks without prior approval of the reserve bank subject to
compliance with the stipulated minimum average maturity period
as applicable to the loan.

(vii) establishment of offices abroad
100. in order to provide greater flexibility to indian corporates
in establishing overseas offices, authorised dealer banks may
now allow remittances on behalf of their customers up to
15 per cent of the average annual sales/income or turnover
during the last two financial years or up to 25 per cent of their
net worth, whichever is higher, for initial expenses. for recurring
expenses, authorised dealer banks may allow remittances up to
10 per cent of the average annual sales/income or turnover
during the last two financial years. authorised dealer banks may
48

also permit remittances for acquisition of immovable property
for the overseas office, within these limits.

(viii) fiis’ investment in government securities
101. it is proposed to permit fiis to invest in securities issued
by the central and state governments by an incremental amount
of 5 per cent of total net issuance in the previous financial year.
this would be over and above the current stipulation of
investment up to us $ 2 billion. accordingly, the existing limit of
us $ 2 billion will be enhanced in phases to us $ 2.6 billion by
december 31, 2006 and further to us $ 3.2 billion by march 31,
2007. the extant limit of us $ 1.5 billion for investment in
corporate debt would, however, continue.

(ix) overseas investment by mutual funds:
enhancement of ceiling
102. the extant ceiling of overseas investment by mutual funds
of us $ 2 billion is enhanced to us $ 3 billion with a view to
providing greater opportunity to mutual funds to invest overseas.

(x) liberalisation of forward contract regulations
103. customs authorities use a fixed exchange rate for a month
for the purpose of levying import duty. in order to provide the
facility of hedging economic exposure, importers will henceforth
be permitted to book forward contracts for their customs duty
component of imports.
104. as per the extant guidelines, fiis are allowed to hedge
the market value of their entire investment in equity and/or debt
in india as on a particular date. furthermore, these forward
49

contracts, once cancelled, cannot be rebooked but may be rolled
over on or before maturity. it is proposed to allow fiis to rebook
a part, say, 25 per cent of the cancelled forward contracts,
provided such contracts are supported by underlying exposure.
the modalities would be finalised in consultation with market
participants.
105. authorised dealer banks are currently permitted to allow
importers and exporters to book forward contracts on the basis
of a declaration of an exposure and based on past performance
up to the average of the previous three financial years’ actual
import/export turnover or the previous year’s actual import/export
turnover, whichever is higher. furthermore, contracts booked in
excess of 25 per cent of the eligible limit have to be on deliverable
basis and cannot be cancelled. in order to provide greater
flexibility to exporters and importers, it is proposed to enhance
this limit to 50 per cent.

(xi) data collection and monitoring
106. the internal task force set up by the reserve bank
would review the data collection/compilation system in pursuance
of a recommendation of the committee on fcac. a ‘working
group on data related issues’ is also proposed to be set up.

(b) other measures
(i)

bank guarantees and/or letters of credit to cover
temporary trade related credits – delegation of
powers to authorised dealer banks

107. authorised dealer banks are permitted to allow advance
remittances for import of services up to us $ 100,000 without
50

the counter-guarantee of a bank of international repute situated
outside india. as a measure towards further liberalisation,
it is proposed to permit authorised dealer banks to
issue guarantees/letters of credit for import of services up to
us $ 100,000 where the guarantee is intended to secure
a direct contractual liability arising out of a contract between
a resident and a non-resident.

(ii) remittances out of nro accounts
108. the existing regulations permit nris and persons of indian
origin (pios) to remit up to us $ one million per calendar year
for any bonafide purpose out of the balances in their non-resident
ordinary (nro) accounts. the amounts credited to the nro
accounts would also represent the sale proceeds of immoveable
property acquired by the non-resident concerned out of her/his
resources in india, or proceeds of property received by way of
inheritance or gift. the sale proceeds of the immoveable property
are at present subject to a lock-in period. on a review, it is
proposed to eliminate the lock-in period, provided the amount
being remitted in any financial year does not exceed us $ one
million.

(c) advisory group on fema regulations
relating to services
109. an advisory group (chairman: shri mohandas pai)
was constituted, as indicated in the annual policy statement of
april, 2006 to review all foreign exchange regulations relating to
services and prepare a compendium of all foreign exchange
regulations that apply to the services sector. the group is
expected to submit its report shortly.
51

(d) working group on cost of nri remittances
110. the working group (chairman: shri p.k. pain) constituted
by the reserve bank to examine various cost aspects of nri
remittances submitted its report in august, 2006. this report
has been placed on the reserve bank’s website for wider
dissemination and comments. on the basis of the
recommendations of the group, it is proposed:
•

to dispense with the existing restrictions on
the number of tie-ups by banks with exchange
houses and the number of drawee branches for
rupee drawing arrangements in respect of those
banks having sound risk management systems.
guidelines in this regard would be issued separately;
and

•

to put in place an ‘awareness programme’ to sensitise
nris on options to minimise cost of remittances;
psbs to identify remittances as an independent
business segment and resort to latest technology for
handling large volume at lower cost and explore
tie-ups with more correspondent banks; to review
the existing scale of charges, both at the foreign and
domestic end; large psbs in india to examine the
feasibility of setting up centralised remittance
receiving centres for efficiency and better service;
improvements in infrastructure and extending the
scope of real time gross settlement (rtgs) for
inter-city settlement between the banks in india.
52

ii. credit delivery mechanisms and
other banking services
111. it has been the endeavour of the reserve bank to improve
credit delivery mechanisms and make available basic banking
services to the widest sections of the society without procedural
hassles. initiatives taken in this regard encompass a wide ambit
covering augmenting credit flow to agriculture and other priority
sectors as well as to distressed farmers and areas stricken by
natural calamities; institutional reform including revival of the
co-operative structure and regional rural banks (rrbs);
development of new avenues of credit dispensation such as
micro-finance institutions and legislation for regulating money
lending; financial inclusion and improvement in customer services.

(a) priority sector lending
112. as indicated in the annual policy statement of april, 2006
the revised draft technical paper of the internal working group
(chairman: shri c.s. murthy) set up by the reserve bank to
review the existing policy on priority sector lending was placed
on the reserve bank’s website for wider dissemination and
comments. based on the feedback, the draft circular will be put
in the public domain shortly.

(b) micro and small enterprises
113. consistent with the notification of the micro, small and
medium enterprises development act, 2006, it is proposed to
modify the definition of small-scale industry and micro and small
enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services for the
purpose of priority sector lending. guidelines to banks would be
issued separately.
53

(c) revival of rural co-operative credit structure
114. the recommendations of the task force (chairman:
prof. a. vaidyanathan) appointed by the government of india to
propose an action plan for reviving the short-term rural
co-operative credit structure have been accepted in principle.
the government of india, in consultation with the state
governments, has approved a revival package for the
short-term co-operative credit structure. the revival package
has been accepted by the states of maharashtra, rajasthan,
gujarat, orissa, madhya pradesh, andhra pradesh, sikkim, and
the union territory of dadra and nagar haveli.

(d) regional rural banks
115. in view of the importance of rrbs as an effective
instrument of credit delivery in the indian financial system,
sponsor banks have been encouraged to merge rrbs
state-wise. the amalgamation of 134 rrbs into 42 new rrbs
sponsored by 18 banks in 16 states has been implemented.
consequently, the total number of rrbs has come down from
196 to 104 by end-august, 2006.
116. a task force on empowering boards of regional rural
banks for improving their operational efficiency (chairman:
dr. k.g. karmakar) has been set up in september, 2006 in order
to empower the boards of rrbs in various functional areas.

(e) relief measures by banks in areas
affected by natural calamities
117. the reserve bank has issued guidelines to banks on
relief measures to be provided in areas affected by natural
54

calamities. these guidelines focus on various reliefs
and concessions that may be extended to existing borrowers,
mainly agriculturists. as announced in the annual policy
statement of april, 2006 the internal working group (chairman:
shri g. srinivasan) constituted to examine various issues in
respect of areas affected by natural calamities, submitted its
report in june, 2006. based on the recommendations of the
group, additional guidelines covering issuance of fresh loans
and restructuring of existing loans to non-farm borrowers, access
to bank accounts, currency management, know your customer
(kyc) norms, clearing and settlement system and business
continuity planning in the affected areas were issued to banks.
118. an empowered task force was constituted in the union
territory of andaman and nicobar islands to expedite relief
measures by banks for tsunami-affected borrowers. the
recommendations of the task force are being implemented.

(f) relief measures for distressed farmers
119. the working group (chairman: prof. s.s. johl), constituted
by the reserve bank to suggest measures for assisting distressed
farmers including provision of financial counselling services and
introduction of a specific credit guarantee scheme under the
deposit insurance and credit guarantee corporation (dicgc)
act for such farmers, submitted its interim report in october,
2006. in the light of the recommendations of the group and with
a view to ensuring transparency in implementation of the one
time settlement (ots) scheme, it is proposed that:
•

banks, with approval of their boards, may formulate
a transparent policy for providing ots facility to those
farmers whose accounts have been rescheduled/
55

restructured due to natural calamities as also those
who have defaulted on account of circumstances
beyond their control.

(g) technical group for review of legislations
on money lending
120. the reserve bank constituted a technical group
(chairman: shri s.c. gupta) to review the efficacy of the existing
legislative framework governing money lending and its
enforcement machinery in different states in the interest of rural
households. various state governments have shown interest in
the deliberations of the group. it has, therefore, been proposed
to co-opt them as special invitees from the state governments
on this group for wider representation.

(h) financial inclusion
121. the annual policy statement of april, 2006 urged all banks
to give effect to the measures announced by the reserve bank
from time to time on financial inclusion at all their branches.

(i)

pilot project of slbcs for 100 per cent
financial inclusion

122. state level/union territory bankers’ committee (slbc/
utlbc) convenor banks in all states/union territories were
advised to identify at least one suitable district in each state/
union territory for achieving 100 per cent financial inclusion by
providing “no frills” accounts as also general purpose credit cards
(gcc) on the lines of the initiative taken in the union territory of
pondicherry. all slbcs/utlbcs have since identified one or
56

more districts for 100 per cent financial inclusion. furthermore,
the slbcs/utlbcs were advised to allocate villages to banks
operating in the respective state/union territory for ensuring
100 per cent financial inclusion and for monitoring the progress
in the slbc/utlbc meetings.

(ii) improvement of banking services in uttaranchal
123. in consultation with the government of uttaranchal, a
working group (chairman: shri v.s. das) was constituted to
examine the problems/issues relating to banking services in
uttaranchal and to prepare an action plan for their improvement.
the report of the working group has been placed on the reserve
bank’s website for wider dissemination. the group’s
recommendations are being implemented.

(iii) improvement of banking services in chhattisgarh
124. in consultation with the government of chhattisgarh, a
working group (chairman: regional director for chhattisgarh
and madhya pradesh) has been constituted to draw up an action
plan for improvement of banking services in the state of
chhattisgarh. the group is expected to submit its report
by end-january, 2007.

(iv) report on problems faced by banks and
borrowers in bihar
125. as a sequel to the finance minister’s review of the working
of banks in the state of bihar, a working group was constituted
(chairman: shri v.s. das) to look into the problems faced by
banks and borrowers in the state of bihar. the group’s report is
under implementation.
57

(v) report of the committee on financial sector
plan for north-eastern region
126. a committee (chairperson: smt. usha thorat) was
constituted by the reserve bank to improve provisions of financial
services in the north-eastern region and prepare an appropriate
state-specific monitorable action plan for the region for achieving
greater financial inclusion. the report of the committee has
been placed on the reserve bank’s website for wider
dissemination. the action points that emerged from the
recommendations of the report have been forwarded to the
agencies concerned for implementation.

(vi) financial inclusion, small customers and
kyc requirements
127. in the context of financial inclusion, it is proposed to further
simplify the kyc procedure:

a.

small accounts: for opening small accounts, banks
need to seek only a photograph of the account holder
and self-certification of address. outstanding balances
in these accounts at any time will be limited to
rs.50,000 and the total transactions limited to
rs.200,000 in one year. as and when the balances
or total transactions exceed these limits, banks may
convert them into normal accounts and follow the
normal procedure of kyc.

b.

normal accounts: banks would continue with the kyc
procedure of obtaining documents of proof of identity
and address as hitherto. the reserve bank will issue
certain clarifications in respect of conduct of the kyc
58

procedure for normal accounts also so as to make it
more customer-friendly.

(i) customer service
128. the reserve bank of india has been taking measures on
an ongoing basis for protection of customers’ rights, enhancing
the quality of customer services and strengthening grievance
redressal mechanisms in the reserve bank as well as in banks.

(i)

banking codes and standards board of india

129. the banking codes and standards board of india
(bcsbi), which was set up as a society in february 2006,
released the code of banks’ commitment to customers (code)
in july, 2006 which sets out minimum standards for fair practices
on various banking transactions for individual customer. out of
84 scbs, 55 covering approximately 93 per cent of domestic
assets of scbs are committed to follow the code as members
of the bcsbi.

(ii) fair practices code: reasonableness of
bank charges
130. pursuant to the annual policy statement of april, 2006
the reserve bank constituted a working group comprising a
nominee of the indian banks’ association (iba) and
representatives of customers to formulate a scheme for ensuring
reasonableness of bank charges and to incorporate the same in
the fair practices code which would be monitored by the bcsbi.
the report of the working group has been placed on the reserve
bank’s website for wider dissemination and comments. the report
has enumerated 27 services of banks as basic services to
individuals and has indicated broad principles of reasonableness
59

for bank charges. furthermore, in regard to monitoring of
compliance with the code by banks, the group has
recommended that the bcsbi may collect from member banks
details of complaints relating to service charges and track the
changes in the levels of service charges to identify any abnormal
increases. the recommendations of the working group have
since been examined and operational guidelines to banks, in
this regard, would be issued shortly.

(iii) housing loans: fairness and transparency
131. it has been reported that some banks, while lending for
housing, are not fully transparent in indicating the circumstances
and factors governing the benchmark in respect of floating rates
as well as in regard to reset clauses. banks are urged to review
all practices which are less than fair or transparent. they are
also urged to afford an opportunity to borrowers to obtain fair
and transparent terms consistent with legal requirements and
fair practices.

(iv) pension payment services
132. the reserve bank continues to take initiatives to improve
services provided by agency banks to pensioners under various
schemes announced by the government of india. under the
‘scheme for payment of pension for central government civil
pensioners through authorised banks’, a pensioner receives
pension through her/his savings/current account operated
individually by her/him. since june, 2006 the central pension
accounting office of government of india has allowed crediting
of the pension amount to a joint account operated by pensioner
with her/his spouse where family pension has been authorised.
60

the reserve bank has issued suitable instructions to agency
banks in this regard.

(v) conduct of government business:
extending ecs facility
133. payment of income tax refund up to rs.25,000 to salaried
assessees are made through electronic clearing services (ecs)
in cities where banks offer this facility. the government of india
has allowed extending ecs for income tax refunds to all
categories of tax payers without monetary limits and, accordingly,
the reserve bank has extended ecs to additional thirteen cities
with effect from september 1, 2006. eleven more cities will be
covered shortly through the state bank of india.

iii. prudential measures
134. the reserve bank has been continuously sharpening its
regulatory and supervisory roles in order to establish a stable
financial system which contributes to public confidence and
accelerated economic growth. furthermore, the reserve bank
is committed to continuing the process of adopting international
best practices with regard to prudential norms and standards of
transparency and disclosure.

(a) new capital adequacy framework: status
135. commercial banks (excluding rrbs) had been advised
that they will be required to adopt the standardised approach for
credit risk and basic indicator approach for operational risk with
effect from march 31, 2007. under the standardised approach,
banks are required to use risk weights which are dependent on
credit ratings. these credit ratings are to be assigned by external
credit assessment institutions (ecais) which have been found
61

eligible by the reserve bank. an internal working group
constituted by the reserve bank for identifying eligible domestic
ecais has submitted its report and its recommendations are
being incorporated into the final guidelines.

(b) basel ii: schedule for compliance
136. the reserve bank is committed to the adoption of
basel ii by the banks and had indicated march 31, 2007 as the
intended date for adoption by all. taking into account the state
of preparedness of the banking system, however, it has been
decided to provide banks some more time to put in place
appropriate systems so as to ensure full compliance with basel ii.
foreign banks operating in india and indian banks having
presence outside india are to migrate to the standardised
approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for
operational risk under basel ii with effect from march 31, 2008.
all other scheduled commercial banks are encouraged to migrate
to these approaches under basel ii in alignment with them but
in any case not later than march 31, 2009. the steering
committee of banks will continue to interact with banks and the
reserve bank, and guide the smooth implementation of basel ii.

(c) comprehensive guidelines on derivatives
137. derivatives play a critical role in shaping the overall risk
profile of banks. over the years, banks have been increasingly
using derivatives for managing risks and have also been offering
these products to corporates. the reserve bank has issued
several guidelines to banks from time to time on various derivative
instruments. in view of the growing complexity, diversity and
volume of derivatives used by banks, an internal group has
been constituted by the reserve bank to review the existing
62

guidelines on derivatives and formulate comprehensive guidelines
on derivatives for banks. these guidelines are intended to cover
broad generic principles for undertaking derivative transactions,
management of risk and sound corporate governance
requirements. the draft guidelines would be placed on the
reserve bank’s website by end-november, 2006.
138. on the basis of the recommendations of an earlier internal
group, a ‘discussion paper on derivative and hedge accounting
by banks’ was prepared and placed on the reserve bank’s
website for wider dissemination. the feedback received from
market participants on the discussion paper is under
examination.

(d) credit information companies (regulation)
act, 2005: status
139. consequent upon the enactment of the credit information
companies (regulation) act, 2005 the reserve bank constituted
a working group (chairman: shri prashant saran) to frame
draft rules and regulations for implementation of the act. the
draft rules and regulations were prepared and placed on the
reserve bank’s website for wider dissemination and comments.
on the basis of the responses received, the draft rules and
regulations have been prepared and would be notified shortly in
consultation with the government of india.

(e) funded and non-funded limits by indian banks
to joint ventures/wholly owned subsidiaries of
indian corporates: enhancement
140. in april, 2003 indian banks were permitted to extend credit/
non-credit facilities to indian joint ventures (jvs)/wholly owned
subsidiaries (wos) abroad up to the extent of 10 per cent of
63

their unimpaired capital funds (tier i and tier ii), subject to
certain conditions. in order to facilitate the expansion of indian
corporates’ business abroad, it is proposed:
•

to enhance the prudential limit on credit and
non-credit facilities extended by banks from the
existing 10 per cent to 20 per cent of unimpaired
capital funds (tier i and tier ii capital) of the bank.

(f) banks’ exposures to systemically
important nbfcs
141. an internal group was constituted by the reserve bank
to study the issues of regulatory convergence, regulatory
arbitrage and to recommend a policy framework for level-playing
field in the financial sector. the report of the group was placed
on the reserve bank’s website for wider dissemination and
comments. in the light of the recommendations of the group
and the feedback received, and in view of the importance of this
segment of the financial sector, a draft circular will be put in the
public domain to invite further feedback by november 3, 2006.
after providing two weeks for comments, the final circular will be
issued before november 30, 2006.

iv. institutional developments
payment and settlement systems
142. the reserve bank continues to strengthen the framework
for payment and settlement systems and harness the full potential
of information technology (it) to improve operational efficiency.
during 2006-07 so far, the focus has been on security of
it systems, financial inclusion and development of electronic
payment products.
64

(a) information systems security and audit:
security of it-based delivery channels
143. the annual policy statement of april 2006 encouraged
banks to ensure compliance with the findings of information
systems audit on a time-bound basis in order to maintain
robustness of it systems. there have been, however, a few
instances of fraudulent attempts to extract customer information
by tampering with it-based delivery channels of banks.
banks are urged to ensure that adequate and appropriate
systems such as enhanced security measures and
customer education are put in place in order to prevent such
malpractices.

(b) it-facilitated financial inclusion
144. the reserve bank has been advocating the need for
financial inclusion which involves the provision of banking
services to all segments of the society. some of the challenges
which need to be addressed for increasing the scope and
coverage of financial inclusion include lack of adequate
infrastructure in rural areas, higher transaction costs and low
volumes of transactions. recognising that it-enabled services
have the potential for effectively addressing these issues, the
reserve bank has initiated action in this direction in the
north-east region, to begin with. the institute for development
and research in banking technology (idrbt) is providing
technological solutions to increase the extent of banking
facilities in this region. banks are urged to harmonise their
it-based initiatives to ensure that the objective of greater financial
inclusion is achieved.
65

(c) electronic payment products: status
and proposed action
145. the coverage of the rtgs system has increased
significantly. by october 23, 2006 rtgs connectivity was
available in 24,425 branches as against a target of 20,000
branches set for end-june, 2006. the number of monthly
transactions of the system has exceeded 300,000. the reserve
bank is committed to improving the quality of service and further
increasing the number of customer transactions through the
rtgs on a priority basis.
146. the national electronic funds transfer (neft) system
for electronic transfer of funds, which was operationalised on
november 1, 2005 is now available at 9,096 branches. the
reserve bank is currently engaged in informing the public about
the benefits of the system in order to ensure increased rural
coverage.
147. the pilot project for cheque truncation system, which aims
at enhancing efficiency in the retail cheque clearing sector, is
expected to be implemented in new delhi by end-december,
2006.
148. it was indicated in the annual policy statement of
april, 2006 that the national settlement system (nss) which
aims at settling clearing positions of various clearing houses
centrally would be introduced by end-december, 2006.
accordingly, to begin with, integration of the integrated
accounting system (ias) with the rtgs was initiated to facilitate
settlement of various ccil-operated clearings (inter-bank
government securities, inter-bank forex, cblo and national
financial switch) through multilateral net settlement batch
66

(mnsb) mode in the rtgs in mumbai. on stabilisation of mnsb
in mumbai, settlements at other centres under the nss would
be taken up in a phased manner.
urban co-operative banks

(a) vision document for ucbs
149. pursuant to the draft vision document for urban
co-operative banks (ucbs), the reserve bank has been entering
into memoranda of understanding (mou) with state governments
with a view to putting in place a structured arrangement for coordination between the state government and the reserve bank
to address the problem of dual control. the reserve bank has
signed mou with four state governments, namely, uttaranchal,
rajasthan, chhattisgarh and goa in addition to the earlier mou
signed with four state governments, viz., andhra pradesh,
gujarat, karnataka and madhya pradesh. task forces for urban
co-operative banks (tafcubs) in these states have been
constituted by the reserve bank and consultative processes
are in operation.

(b) conversion of extension counters into
full-fledged branches
150. in view of the regulatory co-ordination brought about
through signing mou with state governments and based on the
positive experience of the tafcubs, it is proposed:
•

to allow financially sound ucbs registered in states
that have signed mou with the reserve bank and
those registered under the multi-state co-operative
societies act, 2002 to convert existing extension
67

counters into full-fledged branches subject to certain
conditions. guidelines in this regard would be issued
separately.

(c) innovative options for augmenting
capital of ucbs
151. as indicated in the annual policy statement of april, 2006
a working group (chairman: shri n.s. vishwanathan) comprising
representatives of the reserve bank, state governments and
the ucb sector was constituted to explore various options for
raising regulatory capital funds of ucbs and identify alternate
instruments/avenues for augmenting the capital funds. the group
has since submitted its report which would be placed in the
public domain for feedback.

(d) fair practices codes for lenders
152. ucbs play an important role in meeting the credit needs
of small and medium enterprises and retail traders. they also
cater to housing loan requirements predominantly under the
priority sector. the ucbs are also eligible institutions for
applicability of sarfaesi act. in this context, it is important for
ucbs to draw up and implement a fair practices code for
lenders with a view to putting in place a fair and transparent
mechanism for sanction, disbursal and recovery of loans.
accordingly, it is proposed that:
•

the reserve bank, taking into consideration the state
specific environment and needs, would place a model
draft fair practices code for consideration of
tafcubs set up in the states that have signed mous
for deliberation and adoption.
68

non-banking financial companies
153. non-banking financial companies (nbfcs) play a critical
role as an instrument of credit delivery, particularly in the small
scale and retail sectors. the reserve bank has been continuously
emphasising on developing nbfcs into financially strong entities
with skill levels necessary to cater to the needs of the common
people. in order to strengthen the nbfc sector by diversifying
their area of business, it is proposed to allow nbfcs:
•

to issue co-branded credit cards with banks without
risk sharing; and

•

to market and distribute mutual fund products as
agents of mutual funds.

non-banking financial companies: classification
154. a request had been received from the representatives of
the nbfc sector to provide a separate classification for nbfcs
engaged in financing tangible assets. companies engaged in
financing real/physical assets supporting economic activity such
as automobiles, general purpose industrial machinery and the
like would generally correspond to the classification as asset
financing companies. accordingly, it is proposed to re-group
them as asset financing companies. detailed operational
instructions in this regard would be issued separately.
committee on financial sector assessment
155. the world bank and the imf have jointly brought out a
handbook on financial sector assessment in september, 2005
on the basis of their experience in the conduct of the financial
sector assessment programme (fsap) in member countries.
the handbook is designed for use in financial sector
69

assessments and intended to serve as a reference book on the
techniques of such assessments. india has been a forerunner in
comprehensive self-assessment of various international financial
standards and codes, besides being one of the earliest member
countries participating voluntarily in the fsap.
156. in this context, the reserve bank had released a synthesis
report on financial sector assessment in may, 2002 and a
progress report on the assessment in december, 2004.
consistent with this approach, the government of india, in
consultation with the reserve bank, has constituted a committee
on financial sector assessment to undertake a self-assessment
of financial sector stability and development using the handbook
as the base. the committee is chaired by dr. rakesh mohan,
deputy governor, reserve bank of india, with shri ashok jha,
secretary, economic affairs, ministry of finance, government
of india as co-chairman. the committee would report the
progress to the government of india/reserve bank within a
period of six months. the reserve bank would provide the
secretariat to the committee.
