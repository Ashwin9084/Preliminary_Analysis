first bi-monthly monetary policy statement, 2016-17
by dr. raghuram g. rajan, governor
part a: monetary policy
monetary and liquidity measures
on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic
situation, it has been decided to:
•

reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (laf) by 25
basis points from 6.75 per cent to 6.5 per cent;

•

reduce the minimum daily maintenance of the cash reserve ratio (crr) from
95 per cent of the requirement to 90 per cent with effect from the fortnight
beginning april 16, 2016, while keeping the crr unchanged at 4.0 per cent of
net demand and time liabilities (ndtl);

•

continue to provide liquidity as required but progressively lower the average ex
ante liquidity deficit in the system from one per cent of ndtl to a position
closer to neutrality; and

•

narrow the policy rate corridor from +/-100 basis points (bps) to +/- 50 bps by
reducing the msf rate by 75 basis points and increasing the reverse repo rate
by 25 basis points, with a view to ensuring finer alignment of the weighted
average call rate (wacr) with the repo rate;

consequently, the reverse repo rate under the laf stands adjusted to 6.0 per
cent, and the marginal standing facility (msf) rate to 7.0 per cent. the bank rate
which is aligned to the msf rate also stands adjusted to 7.0 per cent.
assessment
2.
since the sixth bi-monthly statement of february 2016, global economic
activity has been quiescent. perceptions of downside risks to recovery in some
advanced economies (aes) at the beginning of 2016 have eased, while major
emerging market economies (emes) continue to contend with weak growth and still
elevated inflation amidst tighter financial conditions. world trade remains subdued
due to falling import demand from emes and stress in mining and extractive
industries. in the us, consumer spending was underpinned by a strengthening labour
market, but flagging exports proved to be a drag on growth in q4 and cloud the nearterm outlook. in the euro area, tailwinds in the form of aggressive monetary policy
accommodation and still low energy prices have supported activity in an environment
beset with uncertainties from the migrant crisis, intensifying stress in the banking
sector, and possible brexit. while japan escaped recession in q4 of 2015, a

2
combination of weak consumer spending, business investment and exports has
slowed the economy in q1 of 2016. in china, sluggish industrial production,
contracting exports, capital outflows and substantial excess capacity in factories and
the property market remain formidable headwinds, notwithstanding significant
monetary and fiscal policy stimulus. eme commodity exporters have benefited
recently from the firming up of commodity prices and risk-on investor sentiment has
appreciated their currencies. across emes, however, weak domestic fundamentals,
lacklustre external demand and country-specific constraints continue to restrain
growth.
3.
global financial markets have recouped the losses suffered in the turbulence
at the beginning of the year. from mid-february, a firming up of crude prices buoyed
market sentiment, allaying fears of global recessionary risks. with china reducing
reserve requirements, the ecb expanding accommodation and the fed providing
dovish guidance while staying on hold, equity markets rallied. in bond markets across
aes and emes, yields gradually eased, with country-specific variations. the us
dollar has retreated from january peak and has eased further in the aftermath of the
fomc’s march meeting. on the other hand, the euro and the yen have appreciated,
reacting perversely to exceptional accommodation. currencies across emes have
also appreciated as portfolio flows returned cautiously to local debt and equity
markets. gold prices have jumped 16 per cent in q1 of 2016 on safe haven demand.
commodity prices, including oil, have picked up recently, though they still remain
soft. however, the uneasy calm that prevails in financial markets could be dispelled
easily by a sudden return of risk-off investor sentiment on incoming data, especially
pertaining to china or to us inflation.
4.
on the domestic front, gross value added (gva) in agriculture and allied
activities moderated in h2 of 2015-16, pulled down by the contraction in q3 due to
the year-on-year decline in kharif production. turning to q4, second advance
estimates of the ministry of agriculture indicate that despite acutely low reservoir
levels and a deficient north-east monsoon, rabi foodgrains production increased over
its level a year ago – mainly in wheat and pulses – and compensated partly for the
shortfall in kharif output. unseasonal rains and hail in march are likely to have
damaged some winter crops, particularly wheat, although full estimates of the crop
loss await advance estimates. on the other hand, fertiliser production has picked up,
and horticulture as well as allied activities have remained resilient, suggesting that
the implicit estimate of gva for agricultural and allied activities in q4 in the cso’s
advance estimates is likely to be achieved, if not revised upwards.
5.
value added in industry accelerated in h2, led by manufacturing which
benefited from the sustained softness in input costs. by contrast, industrial production
remained flat with manufacturing output shrinking since november. robust
expansion in coal output has buoyed both mining activity and electricity generation
and stemmed the weakening of industrial output. however, capital goods production
fell into deep contraction since november, even after excluding lumpy and volatile
items like rubber insulated cable. weak demand and competition from imports have
muted the capex cycle. consumer non-durables production has been shrinking, with
a pronounced decline in q4. this reflects the continuing slack in rural demand. on
the other hand, consumer durables remained strong, even after abstracting from
favourable base effects, which suggests that urban demand is holding up. with
improved perceptions on overall economic conditions and income, the reserve
bank’s consumer confidence survey of march 2016 shows marginal improvement in
consumer sentiments. the march manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (pmi)
continued in expansionary mode on the back of new orders, including exports. the

3
reserve bank’s industrial outlook survey suggests that business expectations for q1
of 2016-17 continue to be positive.

6.
services sector activity expanded steadily through the year, with trade, hotels,
transport, communication and public administration, defence and related services
turning out to be the main drivers in h2. the construction sector continues to be
overburdened by unsold inventory in the residential space, although commercial real
estate is being boosted by demand from information technology (it) and it-enabled
services. road construction has accelerated, including in terms of new awards.
cement production appears to have gained traction during h2, while steel
consumption has increased at a steady pace. various lead and coincident indicators
such as air passenger traffic, air cargo volumes, foreign tourist arrivals and auto
sales increased, while railway freight traffic marginally contracted. the services pmi
remained in expansion mode during h2 on new business and expectations. the
outlook for services in surveys is upbeat for q1 of 2016-17.
7.
retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (cpi) dropped sharply
in february after rising for six consecutive months. this favourable development was
due to a larger than anticipated decline in vegetable prices, helped by prices of
pulses starting to come off the surge that began in august, and effective supply
management that helped limit cereal price increases. accordingly, food inflation
eased for the first time in the second half of 2015-16. notably, this occurred on a
decline in prices rather than favourable base effects, which were at work in the first
half of the year. inflation in the fuel group moderated across electricity, kerosene,
cooking gas and firewood, the latter easing pressures on rural inflation. three months
ahead household inflation expectations declined to a single digit for the second
consecutive round of the survey in response to these dynamics.
8.
cpi inflation excluding food and fuel edged up in february, mainly under
housing, education, personal care and transport and communication, suggesting
capacity constraints in the services sector. excluding petrol and diesel from this
category, inflation stayed elevated and persistent at or above 5 per cent, indicating a
possible resistance level for further downward movements in the headline. the
stubborn underlying inflation momentum is unlikely to be helped by the 7th pay
commission award and the effects of the one-rank-one-pension (orop) award, or
by the cost-push effect of the increase in the service tax rate. however, rural wage
growth as well as the rate of increase in corporate staff costs was moderate. also,
input and output prices polled in purchasing managers’ surveys rose modestly for
manufacturing and services.
9.
liquidity conditions, which had tightened since mid-december, were stretched
further by the larger-than-usual accumulation of cash balances by the government,
unusually heightened and persistent demand for currency, a pick-up in bank credit
and flatter deposit mobilisation at this time relative to past years. the reserve bank
undertook liquidity operations to quell these pressures and supplemented normal
operations with large amounts of liquidity injected through fine-tuning variable rate
repo auctions in tenors ranging between overnight and 56 days. the average daily
liquidity injection (including variable rate overnight and term repos) increased from
1,345 billion in january to
1,935 billion in march. besides, durable liquidity was
also provided through open market operations (omos) of the order of
514 billion
and 375 billion through buy-back operations in february and march. the reserve
bank also started conducting reverse repo and msf operations on holidays in
mumbai to enable the frictionless functioning of the payment and settlement system.

4

10.
effective april 2, 2016 the statutory liquidity ratio (slr) of scheduled
commercial banks was reduced by 25 basis points from 21.5 per cent to 21.25 per
cent of their ndtl. also, from february 2016, banks were allowed to reckon
additional government securities held by them up to 3 per cent of their ndtl within
the mandatory slr requirement as level 1 high quality liquid assets (hqla) for the
purpose of computing their liquidity coverage ratio (lcr), thereby taking the total
carve-out from slr available to banks equivalent to 10 per cent of their ndtl. these
measures will create space for banks to increase their lending to productive sectors
on competitive terms so as to support investment and growth.
11.
fcnr(b) deposits and associated swaps undertaken in september 2013 are
expected to mature starting september this year. it is important to note that these
swaps are fully covered by the reserve bank’s forward purchases. moreover, the
reserve bank will monitor developments closely to contain any unanticipated market
volatility associated with the repayment.
12.
while exports declined in february in us dollar terms for the fifteenth
successive month, the rate of contraction narrowed to a single digit for the first time in
this period and volume growth turned positive. the decline in non-pol exports was
even smaller, with gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronics and
chemicals driving the upturn. the prolonged contraction in imports also slowed
significantly, and non-pol non-gold import growth turned positive for the first time
after seven months. this reflected a sizable upsurge in imports of machinery,
supported by a pick-up in imports of pearls and precious stones and electronic
goods. with gold imports falling in february and march, the continuing softness in
crude prices working favourably in terms of conserving the pol import bill and some
gains in terms of trade, the trade deficit narrowed to its lowest monthly level since
september 2013. in turn, this has likely lowered the current account deficit (cad) in
q4 below 1.3 per cent of gdp recorded in q3, despite a moderation in net receipts
from services exports and remittances. net inflows in the form of foreign direct
investment (fdi) were robust in q4 (up to january), more than sufficient to fund the
external financing requirement. foreign portfolio investors (fpis), who were net
sellers in the domestic capital market up to february, became net buyers in march in
both equity and debt segments.
policy stance and rationale
13.
inflation has evolved along the projected trajectory and the target set for
january 2016 was met with a marginal undershoot. going forward, cpi inflation is
expected to decelerate modestly and remain around 5 per cent during 2016-17 with
small inter-quarter variations (chart 1). there are uncertainties surrounding this
inflation path emanating from recent unseasonal rains, the likely spatial and temporal
distribution of monsoon, the low reservoir levels by historical averages, and the
strength of the recent upturn in commodity prices, especially oil. the persistence of
inflation in certain services warrants watching, while the implementation of the 7th
central pay commission awards will impart an upside to the baseline through direct
and indirect effects. on the other hand, there will be some offsetting downside
pressures stemming from tepid demand in the global economy, government’s
effective supply side measures keeping a check on food prices, and the central
government’s commendable commitment to fiscal consolidation.

5

14.
the uneven recovery in growth in 2015-16 is likely to strengthen gradually into
2016-17, assuming a normal monsoon, the likely boost to consumption demand from
the implementation of the 7th pay commission recommendations and orop, and
continuing monetary policy accommodation. after two consecutive years of deficient
monsoon, a normal monsoon would work as a favourable supply shock,
strengthening rural demand and augmenting the supply of farm products that also
influence inflation. on the other hand, the fading impact of lower input costs on value
addition in manufacturing, persisting corporate sector stress and risk aversion in the
banking system, and the weaker global growth and trade outlook could impart a
downside to growth outcomes going forward. the gva growth projection for 2016-17
is accordingly retained at 7.6 per cent, with risks evenly balanced around it (chart 2).

15.
in its bi-monthly monetary policy statement of february 2, 2016, the reserve
bank indicated that it awaits further data on inflation as well as on structural reforms
in the union budget that boost growth while controlling spending. given recent data,
forecasts in chart 1 indicate that inflation will trend towards the 5 per cent target in
march 2017 under reasonable assumptions. the changes to the rbi act to create a

6
monetary policy committee will further strengthen monetary policy credibility. in the
union budget for 2016-17, the government has adhered to the path of fiscal
consolidation and this will support the disinflation process going forward. the
government has also set out a comprehensive strategy for reinvigorating demand in
the rural economy, enhancing the economy’s social and physical infrastructure, and
improving the environment for doing business and deepening institutional reform. the
implementation of these measures should improve supply conditions and allow
efficiency and productivity gains to accrue. given weak private investment in the face
of low capacity utilisation, a reduction in the policy rate by 25 bps will help strengthen
activity and aid the government’s initiatives.
16.
perhaps more important at this juncture is to ensure that current and past
policy rate cuts transmit to lending rates. the reduction in small savings rates
announced in march 2016, the substantial refinements in the liquidity management
framework announced in this policy review and the introduction of the marginal cost
of funds based lending rate (mclr) should improve transmission and magnify the
effects of the current policy rate cut. the stance of monetary policy will remain
accommodative. the reserve bank will continue to watch macroeconomic and
financial developments in the months ahead with a view to responding with further
policy action as space opens up.
part b: developmental and regulatory policies
17.
this part of the statement reviews the progress on various developmental and
regulatory policy measures announced by the reserve bank in recent policy
statements and also sets out new measures to be taken for further refining the
liquidity management framework; strengthening the banking structure; broadening
and deepening financial markets and extending the reach of financial services to all.
i. liquidity framework for monetary policy operations
18.
the reserve bank’s liquidity framework was changed significantly in
september 2014 in order to implement key recommendations of the expert
committee to revise and strengthen the monetary policy framework (chairman: dr.
urjit r patel). with over six quarters of implementation history, it is appropriate to
review the experience, with a view to making necessary adjustments as well as to
more fully implement the report of the expert committee.
19.
liquidity management is driven by two objectives: first, the need to supply or
withdraw short term liquidity from the market so as to accommodate seasonal and
frictional liquidity needs such as the build-up of government balances and demand
for cash; and second, the need to supply durable liquidity in the economy so as to
facilitate growth, while ensuring that the monetary policy stance is supported.
20.
the reserve bank has kept the system in an ex ante deficit mode on average,
with a liquidity shortfall equivalent to one per cent of banks’ ndtl. the rationale has
been that the banking system would borrow from the reserve bank’s liquidity
facilities, ensuring that the repo rate guided short term money market rates and
thereby was effective as the policy rate.
21.
the first objective of meeting short term liquidity needs has been
accomplished through the provision of liquidity by the reserve bank under its regular
facilities - variable rate 14-day/7-day repo auctions equivalent to 0.75 per cent of
banking system ndtl, supplemented by daily overnight fixed rate repos (at the repo
rate) equivalent to 0.25 per cent of bank-wise ndtl. frictional and seasonal
mismatches that move the system away from normal liquidity provision are

7
addressed through fine-tuning operations, including variable rate repo/reverse repo
auctions of varying tenors. the weighted average call money rate has tracked the
policy rate more closely than in the past, suggesting that short term liquidity needs
have been adequately met.
22.
the reserve bank aims to meet the second objective by modulating net
foreign assets (nfa) and net domestic assets (nda) growth over the course of the
year, broadly consistent with the demand for liquid assets to meet transaction needs
of the economy. this will ensure adequate availability of durable liquidity, regardless
of short term seasonal and frictional fluctuations. the reserve bank tries to smooth
this growth over the year. so, for example, in periods when the reserve bank
purchases significant quantities of nfa, the growth of nda may have to be
commensurately lower and may even have to be negative through the open market
sale of domestic bonds.
23.
experience suggests that the provision of short term liquidity does not
substitute fully for needed durable liquidity, though durable liquidity can substitute for
short term liquidity needs. going forward, the reserve bank intends to first meet
requirements of durable liquidity, and then use its fine-tuning operations to make
short term liquidity conditions consistent with the intended policy stance. this may
result in seemingly anomalous situations in which the reserve bank injects durable
liquidity even when it is using short term instruments to withdraw excess short term
liquidity, but such actions will be consistent with our dual objectives of liquidity
management.
24.
finally, given that new instruments such as variable rate reverse repo auctions
allow the reserve bank to suck out excess short term liquidity from the system
without the excess liquidity being deposited with the reserve bank through overnight
fixed rate reverse repo, it is possible for the reserve bank to keep the system closer
to balance on average without the operational rate falling significantly. thus, the past
rationale for keeping the system in significant average liquidity deficit no longer is as
compelling, especially when the policy stance is intended to be accommodative.
moreover, given that the reserve bank’s market operations rather than depositing or
borrowing at standing facilities determine the operational interest rate, the policy rate
corridor can be narrowed, as suggested by the expert committee.
25.

therefore, it has been decided to:
i) smooth the supply of durable liquidity over the year using asset purchases and
sales as needed;
ii) progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system to a
position closer to neutrality;
iii) narrow the policy rate corridor from +/-100 bps to +/- 50 bps, with a view to
ensuring finer alignment of the wacr with the repo rate;
iv) ease liquidity management for banks without abandoning liquidity discipline by
reducing the minimum daily maintenance of crr from 95 per cent of the
requirement to 90 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning april 16,
2016;
v) allow substitution of securities in market repo transactions in order to facilitate
development of the term money market; and

8
vi) consult with the government on how to moderate the build-up of cash
balances with the reserve bank.
detailed guidelines are being issued separately. the reserve bank will
monitor the consequences of these changes as it modernises the country’s liquidity
framework.
ii. banking structure
26.
large exposures: taking into account the views and suggestions received
from stakeholders on the discussion paper on ‘large exposures framework and
enhancing credit supply through market mechanism’, a fresh discussion paper will
be issued by april 30, 2016 on large borrowers meeting a part of their funding
requirements from markets. a draft circular on the large exposures framework will
be issued for public comments in june 2016 (to be implemented by january 1, 2019).
27.
revision of regulatory framework: the basel committee on banking
supervision (bcbs) has issued final standards on the standardised approach for
measuring counterparty credit risk (sa-ccr), a revised framework for the capital
treatment of bank exposures to central counterparties (ccps) and final rules on
revised pillar 3 disclosure requirements. these standards will be implemented by
january 1, 2017 by bcbs member jurisdictions. the reserve bank proposes to
issue draft guidelines on these standards by may 31, 2016. the reserve bank will
also undertake revision of the guidelines on the securitisation framework in the light
of the bcbs revisions to the securitisation framework which is to be implemented by
january 2018. it is proposed to issue draft guidelines on the revised securitisation
framework by june 2016.
28.
rationalisation of branch authorisation policy: currently, banks provide
services through a variety of business outlets – branches; extension counters;
satellite offices; mobile branches; ultra small branches and the like. the current
policy approach is to facilitate adequate outreach of banking outlets in unbanked
areas while at the same time providing autonomy to banks to decide their business
strategy. given that regulations are written in terms of branches, with a view to
facilitating financial inclusion and providing flexibility on the choice of delivery
channel, it is proposed to redefine branches and permissible methods of outreach
keeping in mind the various attributes of the banks and the types of services that are
sought to be provided.
29.
differentiated licensing of banks: in addition to recently licensed
differentiated banks such as payments banks and small finance banks, the reserve
bank will explore the possibilities of licensing other differentiated banks such as
custodian banks and banks concentrating on whole-sale and long-term financing. a
paper in this regard will be put out for comments by september 2016.
30.
margin requirements for over the counter (otc) derivatives: in march
2015, the bcbs and the international organisation of securities commissions
(iosco) finalised a framework on margin requirements for non-centrally cleared
derivatives. a consultative paper outlining the reserve bank’s approach to
implementation of these requirements will be issued by end-april 2016 with a target
of finalising the framework by end-july 2016.
31.
countercyclical capital buffers (cccb): a review and empirical testing of
cccb indicators was carried out by the reserve bank to assess whether activation
of the cccb is warranted and it has been decided that it is not necessary to activate
cccb at this point in time.

9
32.
supervisory enforcement framework: changes in the domestic and
international financial sector environment necessitate formalisation of an improved
supervisory framework for taking enforcement action against scheduled commercial
banks for non-compliance of instructions and guidelines issued by the reserve bank.
the framework, which is intended to meet the principles of natural justice and global
standards of transparency, predictability, standardisation, consistency, severity and
timeliness of action, will be formalised by june 2016.
33.
cyber risks - supervisory assessment of preparedness of banks: the
reserve bank has commenced detailed examination of it used by banks on a pilot
basis during the current year. it examination reports are being issued separately so
as to strengthen the information security preparedness of banks as well as to assess
the effectiveness of it adoption by banks. moving forward, it is planned to cover
major banks in 2016-17 and all banks from 2017-18. the reserve bank has
constituted an expert panel (chairperson: smt. meena hemachandra) on it
examination and cyber security to provide broad guidance on its approach.
34.
technology support to urban cooperative banks (ucbs): as a part of the
memorandum of understanding with the state governments/central government on
ucbs, the reserve bank had agreed to provide technology support to ucbs with the
objective of financial inclusion and ensuring implementation of standardised core
banking solutions (cbs). it has been decided to prescribe standards and
benchmarks for cbs in ucbs and provide financial assistance and technical support
through the institute for development and research in banking technology (idrbt).
the initial set-up cost in this regard will be borne by the reserve bank while the
recurring cost will be borne by the ucbs. a circular in this regard is being issued
separately.
iii. financial markets
35.
introduction of money market futures: the working group on enhancing
liquidity in the government securities and interest rate derivatives (chairman: shri
r. gandhi) had recommended introduction of interest rate futures based on the
overnight call money borrowing rate. it is important to develop such market
segments which could signal expectations of market participants, while allowing
hedging of asset-liability mismatches. it has been decided to allow futures on an
appropriate money market rate. the contract specifications will be decided in
consultation with market participants and the securities and exchange board of india
(sebi) by end-september 2016.
36.
easier market access to gilt account holders: with a view to easing the
process of investment by gilt account holders, it will be made incumbent on
custodians to provide all gilt account holders access to the nds-om web facility to
enable them to trade directly on the platform. a similar facility is also proposed to be
extended to foreign portfolio investors (fpis). detailed guidelines in this regard will be
issued by end-june 2016.
37.
broadening market participation - electronic trading platforms: in order
to broaden participation in otc derivatives and to provide a safe trading
environment, it is proposed to put in place a policy framework for authorisation of
electronic platforms with linkage to an approved central counterparty for settlement.
the framework will also cover forex platforms to facilitate hedging by small and retail
customers. the draft framework will be placed on the website for wider feedback by
end-september 2016. furthermore, in order to make participation in otc derivative

10
markets through electronic platforms more broad-based, it is proposed to review the
existing guidelines on otc derivatives. guidelines will be issued by end-may 2016.
38.
tripartite repo in government securities market: the working group on
enhancing liquidity in the government securities and interest rate derivatives
(chairman: shri r. gandhi) had recommended introduction of tripartite repo to
develop a term repo market. in this context, it has been decided to undertake a
comprehensive review of collateralised money market segments, including
introduction of tripartite repo, in consultation with market participants. the review will
be placed on the reserve bank’s website by september 2016 for wider feedback.
39.
review of guidelines for commercial paper (cp): with a spurt in the
issuance of cps, market participants and the fixed income money market and
derivatives association (fimmda) have expressed the need for greater transparency
and better dissemination of information. accordingly, it is proposed to undertake a
comprehensive review of guidelines with the objective of, inter alia, strengthening
disclosure requirements by issuers of cps, reviewing the role of issuing and paying
agents (ipas) and putting in place an information dissemination mechanism. draft
guidelines in this regard will be issued by end-july 2016 for wider feedback.
40.
guidelines for accounting of repo/reverse repo transactions with the
reserve bank: it is proposed to align the accounting norms to be followed by market
participants for repo/reverse repo transactions under the liquidity adjustment facility
(laf) and the marginal standing facility (msf) with the accounting guidelines
prescribed for market repo transactions. guidelines in this regard will be issued by
end-may 2016.
41.
easing of restrictions on plain vanilla forex options: currently, plain
vanilla currency options require adherence to stringent suitability and
appropriateness norms although they are considered a generic product, while
forward contracts are exempt from the same. it is proposed to bring plain vanilla
forex options bought by bank clients at par with forex forwards on regulatory
requirements. detailed guidelines will be issued by end-september 2016.
42.
forex benchmark-rbi reference rate: the reserve bank calculates and
notifies the reference rate of the rupee (inr) against the us dollar and also publishes
inr rates against the euro, the pound sterling and the yen every day around 1:30
p.m. these rates are based on quotes polled from a select list of contributing banks.
as recommended by the committee on financial benchmarks (chairman: shri p.
vijaya bhaskar), it has been decided to move over to a process of determining the
reference rate based on actual market transactions on volume weighted basis with
effect from may 2, 2016.
43.
allowing non-resident indians (nris) to participate in the exchange
traded currency derivatives (etcd) market: it has been decided to permit nris
to participate in the etcds, subject to limits and other conditions that are stipulated
by the exchanges recognised by the sebi. guidelines in this regard will be issued by
the reserve bank in consultation with the sebi by end-june 2016.
44.
initiatives for start-ups: in the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement
for 2015-16 and the press release dated february 2, 2016 the reserve bank had
highlighted the steps being taken with respect to the government’s initiatives to
promote ease of doing business for start-ups. guidelines/clarifications have already
been issued in areas such as online submission of form a2 for outward remittances
up to certain thresholds, issue of shares without cash payments and acceptance of

11
payments by the indian start-ups on behalf of their overseas subsidiaries. in addition,
guidelines in respect of deferred payment through escrow/ indemnity arrangement for
transfer of shares, enabling investment by foreign venture capital investors (fvcis) in
start-ups and overseas investment operations for start-ups will be issued soon in
consultation with the government. furthermore, the simplification of process for
dealing with delayed reporting of fdi transactions and provisions for an enabling
external commercial borrowing regime for start-ups are being examined by the
government and the reserve bank.
iv. non-banking financial sector, financial inclusion and payment and
settlement
45.
simplification of process of registration of new non-banking financial
companies (nbfcs): in order to make the process of registration of new nbfcs
smoother and hassle free, it has been decided to simplify and rationalise the process
of registering new nbfcs. the new application forms will be simpler and the number
of documents required to be submitted will be reduced to a minimum.
46.
peer to peer lending (p2p): p2p lending has shown accelerated growth
over the last one year. while encouraging innovations, the reserve bank cannot be
oblivious to the risks posed by such institutions to the system. a concept note on
p2p lending will be put up on the reserve bank’s website for public comments by
april 30, 2016 and based on the feedback, the contours of regulating p2p lending will
be decided in consultation with the sebi.
47.
strengthening business correspondent (bc) infrastructure: the bc
model offers significant scope for further strengthening. accordingly, the following
initiatives are proposed:
i) in order to ensure the competence of bcs and to promote quality delivery of
financial services, a graded certification/training programme for bcs is
proposed to be introduced. this would enable bcs with a good track record
and advanced training to be entrusted with more complex tasks such as
handling/delivery of financial products that go beyond deposit and remittance.
the reserve bank will issue the necessary framework for establishing a
certification programme for bcs by end-june 2016. based on the framework,
the indian banks’ association (iba) will be requested to put in place a system
