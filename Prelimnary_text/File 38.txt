first quarter review of monetary policy 2011-12
by
dr. d. subbarao
governor
introduction
the reserve bank’s annual
policy statement of may 3, 2011
highlighted several risk factors to the
growth-inflation outlook. many of these
risks have materialised. on the global
front, the sovereign debt problems that
have beset the euro area over the past
year now threaten larger economies in
the region. in the us, concerns over a
sovereign default loom over financial
markets, with potentially disruptive
consequences for global capital flows.
japan is dealing with the challenges
of recovering from the impact of the
tsunami amidst deeper recessionary
tendencies.

prices of many commodities, including
that of crude oil, have shown signs of
softening, reflecting weakening demand
in advanced economies. had this trend
consolidated, it would have provided
some welcome relief from inflationary
pressures. however, one quarter later,
the downtrend has not yet proved to be
very strong. prices are generally still
high compared with last year. with
no immediate prospects of monetary
tightening in the advanced economies,
the impact of weakening demand
appears to be offset by that of abundant
liquidity.

2.
in striking contrast to advanced
economies, emerging market economies
(emes) have generally been dealing
with rising inflation, caused by a
combination of elevated commodity
prices and robust domestic demand.
while the two-speed recovery has been
spoken about for some time, its very
different impact on advanced economies
and emes is now clearly visible.

4.
on the domestic front, a
revised and rebased index of industrial
production (iip) suggested that earlier
signals of a growth deceleration in
the second half of 2010-11 were
exaggerated. in fact, the growth
momentum remained strong throughout
the year. however, data for april-may
2011 suggest that some moderation
might be under way, reflecting in part
a lagged response to the monetary
tightening that has been effected since
october 2009.

3.
from the perspective of india's
macroeconomic policy imperatives,
a critical consideration is the effect that
global conditions will have on commodity
prices. since the may 3 statement, the

5.
notwithstanding
signs
of
moderation, inflationary pressures are
clearly very strong. importantly, the
softening of commodity prices over the
past three months did not translate into

1

a decline in either headline wholesale
price index (wpi) inflation or non-food
manufacturing inflation. if the softening
reverses, commodity prices are likely
to exert inflationary pressures for some
time, making moderation in demand
necessary to bring inflation down.
6.
overall, the current balance of
global and domestic factors suggests
that monetary policy needs to persist
with a firm anti-inflationary stance.
moreover, moderating domestic growth
will certainly help ease inflationary
pressures, which may be reinforced by
possible softening in global commodity
prices.

7.
this policy review is set in the
context of the above uncertain global
and domestic economic environment.
it should be read and understood
together with the detailed review
in macroeconomic and monetary
developments released yesterday by
the reserve bank. this statement is
organised in four sections: section i
provides an overview of the global
and
domestic
macroeconomic
developments; section ii sets out the
outlook and projections for growth,
inflation and monetary aggregates;
section iii explains the stance of
monetary policy; and section iv specifies
the monetary policy measures.

i. the state of the economy
global economy
8.
the pace of global expansion
moderated in q2 of 2011. several
factors contributed to this - high oil and
other commodity prices, supply chain
disruptions from japan, sovereign debt
concerns in the euro area, and continued
weakness in the us housing and labour
markets.
9.
concerns over the euro area
sovereign debt problem re-emerged on
the back of greece’s deteriorating fiscal
position, downgrading of portugal’s
sovereign debt rating, and most
significantly, signs of stress in italy's
sovereign debt. there is heightened
anxiety about whether the euro area
will be able to agree on an economically
viable,
fiscally
sustainable
and
politically feasible solution to the vexing
sovereign debt problem. in this regard,
2

the agreement reached by the euro zone
leaders in their meeting on july 21, 2011
is a positive development. however, its
effective implementation remains to be
seen.
10.
medium-term sovereign debt
sustainability issues are also under
debate in the us, although the nearterm focus is on the constraints posed
by the existing debt ceiling. the
unemployment rate edged up in the us
and showed no improvement in other
major advanced economies. the us
national home price index declined
further in q1 of 2011.
11.
international prices of oil and
other commodities softened in the
weeks after the may 3 policy statement
on the back of a slowdown in economic
activity, but they remain at elevated
levels. crude prices, which moderated

in june 2011 on account of the decision of
the international energy agency (iea)
members to release 60 million barrels
of crude from their strategic reserves to
offset supply disruptions, have edged up
again. brent crude price has ruled above
us$ 110 a barrel in july 2011 so far. on a
year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, the world
bank’s index of energy prices was up
by 39 per cent in june 2011. also, the
food and agriculture organisation’s
(fao) food price index in june 2011 was
39 per cent higher than in june 2010.
12.
despite
sluggish
economic
activity, inflationary pressures also
emerged in advanced economies under
the impact of high commodity prices.
core inflation has picked up in the us
and the euro area. in view of headline
inflation remaining above its target, the
european central bank (ecb) raised
its policy rate in july 2011, its second
rate hike since it began to exit from
its expansionary monetary stance in
april 2011.

moderation in economic activity. the
increase in the iip by 5.7 per cent in
april-may 2011 was lower as compared
with the increase of 10.8 per cent in
the corresponding period of last year.
merchandise trade, however, registered
strong growth with exports expanding
by 46 per cent during q1 of 2011-12.
15.
according to the reserve bank’s
order books, inventories and capacity
utilisation survey (obicus), capacity
utilisation in q4 of 2010-11 increased
significantly to 77.4 per cent. however,
the forward-looking industrial outlook
survey (ios), conducted during june
2011, showed a decline in the overall
business sentiment in q1 of 2011-12
and further slippage for the following
quarter. the hsbc purchasing managers’
index (pmi) for june 2011 showed
moderation in the growth of manufacturing
activity, although the pmi for services
moved up marginally.

domestic economy

16.
the south-west monsoon has
been one per cent below normal so far
(july 20, 2011). however, the reserve
bank’s production weighted rainfall
index at 104 shows an above normal
trend so far. area-wise, 88 per cent of
the country received excess/normal
rainfall. significantly, kharif sowing this
season (up to july 22, 2011) in respect
of pulses, coarse cereals, oilseeds and
cotton has been lower compared with
the same period of last year.

14.
gdp grew by 8.5 per cent during
2010-11. this estimate could undergo
some upward revision since the new
iip series (base: 2004-05) shows that
industrial growth did not moderate
in the second half of 2010-11 as
earlier thought. latest available data
for 2011-12, however, suggest some

17.
inflation continues to be the
dominant macroeconomic concern.
the headline wpi inflation rate was 9.7
per cent in april 2011. the provisional
inflation figure was 9.1 per cent in may
2011 and 9.4 per cent in june. given
the recent pattern, these numbers are
likely to be revised upwards. thus, the

13.
reflecting high commodity
prices as well as strong demand,
headline as well as core inflation in
emes remained elevated in the first half
of 2011. inflation in china reached a
3-year high of 6.4 per cent in june 2011.
many emes persisted with monetary
tightening in q2 of 2011.

3

headline wpi inflation rate for q1 of
2011-12 remained stubbornly close to
double digits and inflationary pressures
continued to remain broad-based. both
the level and the persistence of wpi
inflation are a cause for concern.
18.
non-food manufactured products
inflation was 7.0 per cent in april 2011.
according to provisional data, it rose
to 7.3 per cent in may and remained
high at 7.2 per cent in june. this
should be seen in comparison with
the average non-food manufactured
product inflation of 4 per cent over
the last six years. the persistence of
high non-food manufactured products
inflation suggests that producers,
operating at high levels of capacity
utilisation, are able to pass on rising
commodity input prices and wage costs
to consumers. early corporate results for
q1 of 2011-12 suggest some moderation
in margins. however, such moderation
so far has been modest, implying that
pricing power persists.
19.
fuel group inflation increased
in june 2011 due, in part, to the impact
of the administered price increases on
june 25, 2011, even though nonadministered fuel prices, especially that
of aviation turbine fuel, declined.
20.
inflation in respect of protein
rich items such as egg, fish, meat and
milk remains elevated. according to the
66th round of consumer expenditure
survey of the national sample survey
office (nsso), the share of food
items in total consumer expenditure
declined between 2004-05 and 2009-10.
however, during the same period,
the share of protein-rich items in total
consumer expenditure increased both
in rural and urban areas.
4

21.
inflation, as measured by the
consumer price indices (cpi), has been
declining but remains high. reflecting
the moderation in food inflation,
cpi inflation for industrial workers
(cpi - iw) dropped from 9.4 per cent in
april to 8.7 per cent in may 2011. with
the latest reading of 108.8 in june 2011
(base: 2010=100), the new all-india
cpi too suggests persistence of price
pressures.
22.
in response to the monetary
policy measures initiated by the
reserve bank, scheduled commercial
banks (scbs) have been raising
their domestic deposit rates. during
2010-11, the modal term deposit rate of
all scbs rose by 165 basis points (bps).
it rose further by about 60 bps during
april-july, 2011.
23.
as scbs raised their deposit
rates, they saw response by way of
an acceleration in growth of deposits
from 17.4 per cent, y-o-y, in early
april 2011 to 18.4 per cent in early
july 2011. simultaneously, currency
growth decelerated from 18.4 per cent
to 15.0 per cent in the corresponding
period. on the back of good deposit
growth, y-o-y broad money supply
(m3) increased by 17.1 per cent in
early july 2011 outpacing the reserve
bank’s indicative trajectory of 16
per cent. though a decline in the
currency-deposit ratio is desirable
for efficient financial intermediation,
paradoxically, its immediate impact
in terms of a higher money multiplier
may be in the form of increased
inflationary pressure.
24.
year-on-year non-food credit
growth decelerated from 21.3 per cent
in march 2011 to 19.5 per cent

as on july 1, 2011, but it was
still above the may 3 statement
indicative projection of 19 per cent.
non-food credit growth was broadbased with credit to industry, services
and personal categories registering
higher growth. disaggregated data
suggest that credit to the industrial sector
continued to be led by infrastructure.
25.
the reserve bank’s estimates
show that the total flow of financial
resources from banks, domestic
non-bank and external sources to
the commercial sector during q1 of
2011-12 was lower at ` 2,40,000 crore as
compared with ` 2,63,000 crore during
the corresponding period of last year.
26.
the base rate system, introduced
since july 1, 2010, has improved the
transparency in lending rates and also
enabled a more informed assessment
of the transmission of monetary policy
impulses to banks’ lending rates. since
july 2010, the modal base rate of
banks has increased by 225 basis points.
the base rate system of loan pricing
coupled with deficit liquidity conditions
has increased both the strength and
the transparency of the monetary
transmission process.
27.
consistent with the policy
stance, liquidity conditions have
generally remained in deficit mode
so far in 2011-12. the average daily
net injection of liquidity through the
liquidity adjustment facility (laf)
window during this period till july 22
was around ` 48,000 crore, which was
within one per cent of ndtl.
28.
the 10-year government security
yield increased from 8.1 per cent at
end-april 2011 to 8.3 per cent in july
2011. however, short-term yields rose
5

faster in response to policy rate hikes
and increased issuance of short-term
paper, resulting in flattening of the
yield curve. one interpretation of the
relatively stable long-term yields is
that inflationary expectations over the
longer-term horizon remain anchored.
29.
the real estate market remained
firm. the reserve bank’s quarterly
house price index suggests that
housing prices rose in most cities
in q4 of 2010-11. the volume of
house transactions also picked up in
q4 of 2010-11 in most of the seven
cities for which the index is compiled.
30.
during april-may 2011, the
central government’s revenue deficit
and fiscal deficit turned out to be higher
than the levels during the corresponding
period of the previous year reflecting
lower revenue receipts and higher
expenditure. up to july 18, 2011,
the central government completed
34 per cent of its budgeted net market
borrowing programme, as compared
with 37 per cent in the corresponding
period of last year.
31.
the exchange rate moved in both
directions in the range of ` 44.05–45.38
per us$ during q1 of 2011-12. on an
average basis, while the 6-currency
real effective exchange rate (reer)
appreciated by 1.5 per cent, both the
30-currency reer and the 36-currency
reer depreciated marginally by
around 0.6 per cent.
32.
as regards the external sector,
the current account deficit (cad)
moderated to 2.6 per cent of gdp in
2010-11 from 2.8 per cent of gdp in
the previous year. apart from sustained
invisible receipts, this was due to robust
export growth in the second half of

2010-11. in q1 of 2011-12, export
growth remained strong, expanding by
46 per cent over the corresponding
quarter of the previous year; imports
grew by 31 per cent during the
quarter.
33.
in q1 of 2011-12, major
components of capital inflows showed
an increase. in particular, fdi inflows
were us$ 7.8 billion in april-may 2011

compared with us$ 4.4 billion in the
corresponding period of last year. ecb
approvals were higher at us$ 8.1 billion
in april-june 2011 compared with us$
5.3 billion in the corresponding period
of last year. foreign exchange reserves
were at us$ 314.5 billion as on july
15, 2011, up from us$ 304.8 billion at
end-march 2011, largely reflecting
normal accruals and valuation effects.

ii. outlook and projections
global outlook
growth
34.
taking into account the loss
of momentum of recovery during
q2 of 2011, the imf, in its june, 2011
update of world economic outlook
(weo),
revised
downwards
its
estimates for global growth in 2011 to
4.3 per cent from its april 2011 estimate
of 4.4 per cent. more importantly,
according to the imf, downside risks
to global growth have increased on
account of continuing sluggishness in
major advanced economies due to the
weak labour and housing markets, and
lingering sovereign debt concerns.
inflation
35.
globally, while growth is set
to decelerate, inflation is expected
to edge up in 2011 reflecting higher
commodity prices and strong demand
in emes. although prices of cotton,
rubber and metals have softened in the
recent period, crude oil prices continue
to be volatile and the outlook on this
front remains uncertain. the imf’s
projection is that consumer price
inflation is likely to increase from
6

1.6 per cent in 2010 to 2.6 per cent in
2011 in advanced economies, and from
6.1 per cent to 6.9 per cent in emerging
and developing economies.
domestic outlook
growth
36.
the may 3 policy statement
projected baseline real gdp growth
for 2011-12 at around 8.0 per cent. this
estimate, made for policy purposes,
was based on the assumption of a
normal monsoon and crude oil prices
averaging us$ 110 a barrel. subsequent
information suggests that this projection
remains valid. the baseline scenario
envisages some moderation in growth
partly as a result of the monetary stance,
but this is consistent with the objective
of controlling inflation. however, the
extent of moderation will be limited by
the overall buoyancy in consumption,
in part an outcome of overall increases
in real wages. exports performance, if
persists, will also help contain the growth
moderation. as regards the monsoon,
its performance till the third week of
july 2011 was close to normal, which
bodes well for overall production.
however, its spatial distribution

indicates possible pressure on yields
of coarse grains, pulses, oilseeds
and cotton. a firmer assessment of
agricultural performance will be made
in the mid-quarter review to be released
in september 2011.
37.
against this backdrop, the
baseline projection of real gdp growth
is retained at 8.0 per cent, as set out in
the may 3 policy statement (chart 1).
38.
it is important to recognise that
in the absence of appropriate actions for
addressing supply bottlenecks, especially
in food and infrastructure, questions about
the ability of the economy to sustain the
current growth rate without significant
inflationary pressures come to the fore.
the economy's ability to grow rapidly
for any length of time without provoking
inflation is dependent on implementing
policies, with corresponding resource
allocations, which will allow the supply
of various products and services to keep
pace with demand.
7

inflation
39.
in its may 3 policy statement, the
reserve bank made a baseline projection
for wpi inflation for march 2012 at 6.0
per cent with an upside bias. some of the
upside risks have subsequently materialised
and added to inflation pressures.
40.
first, prices of petroleum
products such as petrol, diesel, kerosene
and lpg were raised in may/june 2011.
the increase in administered petroleum
product prices in june 2011 will add
about 70 basis points to wpi inflation as
a direct impact. in addition, there will be
an indirect impact which will play out
during the course of the year. there will
be further upward pressure on inflation
due to another one-off factor. the sharp
upward revision in domestic crude
prices under the minerals category,
with a weight of 0.9 per cent in wpi,
added about 40 bps to wpi inflation in
april 2011. a similar impact may be
felt in march 2012 unless crude prices
moderate significantly.

41.
second,
minimum
support
prices (msps) for some agricultural
commodities, particularly rice and
pulses, were increased significantly.
this is likely to exert upward pressure
on food inflation even if the harvest is
good.
42.
third, non-food manufacturing
inflation persists at elevated levels,
reflecting underlying demand pressures.
while early corporate results for q1 of
2011-12 indicate some moderation in
margins, suggesting reduced pricing
power, the pass-through of higher
commodity prices into more generalised
inflation remains significant.
43.
going forward, the inflation
outlook will be shaped by the following
factors. first, it will depend on the
overall performance of the south-west
monsoon. even if there is no major
deficiency at the aggregate level,
an appropriate spatial and temporal
distribution of rainfall during the
whole season is crucial. as price
pressures in respect of protein-rich
items persist, any shortfall in rainfall
or its pattern could pose significant
risks to food inflation.
44.
second, the outlook for crude oil
prices in the near future is uncertain.
the price of the indian crude basket rose
to us$ 114 per barrel as on july 21, 2011
after declining to us$ 110 per barrel in
may from us$ 118 per barrel in april.
going by the recent trend, the price of oil
could remain volatile as a consequence
of the pace of global recovery, liquidity
conditions and, importantly, the overall
oil supply situation.
45.
third, there is still an element
of suppressed inflation in the
economy. despite the recent increase
8

in administered fuel prices, underrecoveries on account of subsidised fuel
are estimated at over `1,00,000 crore
(1.0 per cent of gdp) of which a major
portion may have to be borne by
the government. regardless of how
this issue is handled, there will be
implications for inflation. if the
government
raises
administered
prices, the inflation implications are
straightforward. if the government
absorbs this in the fiscal accounts, the
resultant expansionary impact will add
to inflation pressures. notwithstanding
the inflationary impact, if the
crude prices do not moderate in the
near-term, it will be desirable to pass
on the increase, both from the
perspective of energy conservation and
containing demand.
46.
fourth, there are administered
items in the wpi basket, whose prices
might be increased in the coming
months. for instance, coal prices were
increased significantly in february 2011.
since coal is an input into electricity
generation, administered electricity
prices might also increase. but the
timing of changes in administered
prices is uncertain, which will have a
bearing on the inflation path.
47.
keeping in view the domestic
demand-supply balance, the global
trends in commodity prices and the
likely demand scenario, the baseline
projection for wpi inflation for
march 2012 is revised upward from 6.0
per cent with an upside bias, as indicated
in the may 3 policy statement, to 7.0
per cent (chart 2). as indicated in the
may 3 policy statement, inflation is
expected to remain at an elevated level for
a few more months, before moderating
towards the later part of the year.

48.
notwithstanding the current
inflation scenario, it is important to
recognise that in the last decade, the
average inflation rate, measured in terms
of both wpi and cpi, had moderated
to around 5.5 per cent. as mentioned
in the may 3 policy statement, the
reserve bank is strongly of the view that
controlling inflation is imperative both
for sustaining growth over the mediumterm and for increasing the potential
growth rate. this is a critical attribute of a
favourable investment climate, on which
the economy's potential growth depends.
fiscal consolidation can contribute to a
sustainable growth path by rebalancing
demand
away
from
government
consumption and towards investment.
49.
monetary policy will, therefore,
condition and contain perceptions of
inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent,
with particular focus on the behaviour
of
the
non-food
manufacturing
component. this will be in line with the
medium-term objective of 3.0 per cent
9

inflation consistent with india’s broader
integration into the global economy.
the achievement of this objective will
be helped by concerted policy actions
and resource allocations to address
domestic supply bottlenecks, particularly
on the food and infrastructure fronts.
monetary aggregates
50.
the current trends in money
supply (m3) and credit growth remain
above the indicative trajectory of the
reserve bank. keeping in view the
evolving growth-inflation dynamics,
the indicative projection of m3 growth
for 2011-12 is revised downwards
from 16.0 per cent, as set out in the
may 3 policy statement, to 15.5 per cent.
non-food bank credit growth projection
is also revised downwards from 19.0
per cent to 18.0 per cent.
risk factors
51.
the indicative projections of
growth and inflation for 2011-12 are

subject to several risks as detailed
below.
i)

notwithstanding some moderation,
global commodity prices, especially
that of oil, continue to weigh on
both domestic growth and inflation.
the future path of crude oil prices
is uncertain. should the recovery
in advanced economies pick up,
there may be upward pressure on
prices. on the other hand, should
the recovery stall, the easy liquidity
conditions will continue to prevail
leading to continued speculative
positions which may prevent prices
from softening.

ii) the uncertain global macroeconomic environment poses a
challenge for the domestic economy
from the perspective of financing
the current account deficit. in this
context, the composition of capital
flows remains a concern. in recent
months, some shift in composition
of capital flows towards fdi has
been observed. this trend needs to
be reinforced through policy actions
to improve the quality of financing
of the current account deficit.
iii) there are risks to the food
inflation outlook. first, although
the monsoon has been close to
normal so far, deficient rainfall
in august coupled with higher
msp could result in an upward
movement in cereals and pulses
price inflation. second, inadequate
supply response could keep price

10

inflation of protein-rich items such
as egg, meat, fish, milk and pulses
high.
iv) the central government budgeted
a fiscal deficit of 4.6 per cent
of gdp for 2011-12. subsequent
developments have made the
achievement of this target much
more of a challenge. on the
expenditure side, the subsidy
burden will, in all likelihood,
overshoot the budgeted amount
in 2011-12 significantly, despite
the recent revision in petroleum
product prices. on the revenue
side, while the tax cuts announced
in june 2011, as part of the upward
price adjustment of petroleum
products, will primarily help in
bringing down the magnitude of
under-recoveries of oil marketing
companies (omcs), the revenue
loss to the central government
from such tax cuts (about 0.3
per cent of gdp) will impact both
the fiscal and revenue deficits.
the large fiscal deficit has been a
key source of demand pressures.
fiscal consolidation is, therefore,
critical to managing inflation.
while
meeting
quantitative
targets, the government also
needs to focus on the quality of
expenditure to sustain the fiscal
consolidation process, which, in
turn, will help contain aggregate
demand and raise potential
output.

iii. the policy stance
52.
since october 2009, when the
reserve bank signalled the reversal of
its crisis driven expansionary monetary
policy stance, it has raised the cash
reserve ratio (crr) by 100 bps. it has
also raised the policy rate (the repo
rate) ten times by a cumulative 275 bps.
as the liquidity in the system transited
from surplus to deficit, the effective
tightening has been of the order of
425 bps.
53.
the monetary policy response
in 2010-11 was calibrated on the basis
of india specific growth-inflation
dynamics in the broader context of
global uncertainties and perceived
slowdown in the second half of the year.
however, considering the persistence
of inflation above the comfort level of
the reserve bank, and based on the
premise that high inflation is inimical
to long-term growth, the reserve bank
has persevered with its anti-inflationary
stance in 2011-12.
54.
against the backdrop of
global and domestic macroeconomic
conditions, outlook and risks, our
policy stance for 2011-12 has been
conditioned by the following major
considerations.
55.
first, demand pressures have
remained strong. as indicated in the
may 3 policy statement, inflation was
expected to remain elevated in the first
half of 2011-12. actual inflation so far
has been even higher than expected.
the sharp revision in non-food
manufactured products inflation during
february-april 2011 confirms the

11

assessment of strong demand pressures.
crude oil prices remain volatile and
are a major risk. the recent increase in
domestic administered fuel prices and
the minimum support price for certain
food items will keep inflation under
pressure.
56.
second, there are signs that
growth is beginning to moderate,
particularly in respect of some interest
sensitive sectors. however, there is
no evidence of a sharp or broad-based
slowdown as yet. several indicators
such as exports and imports, indirect
tax collections, corporate sales and
earnings and demand for bank credit
suggest that demand is moderating,
but only gradually. as such demand
side inf lationary pressures continue
to prevail. although the impact of
past monetary policy actions is still
getting transmitted, considering the
overall growth and inf lation scenario,
there is a need to persevere with the
anti-inf lationary stance.
57.
against the above backdrop, the
stance of the monetary policy of the
reserve bank will be as follows:


maintain
an
interest
rate
environment
that
moderates
inflation and anchors inflation
expectations.



manage the risk of growth falling
significantly below trend.



manage liquidity to ensure that
monetary transmission remains
effective, without exerting undue
stress on the financial system.

iv. monetary measures
58.
on the basis of current assessment
and in line with the policy stance outlined
in section iii, the reserve bank announces
the following policy measures:



reinforce the cumulative impact of
past actions on demand;



maintain the credibility of the
commitment of monetary policy
to controlling inflation, thereby
keeping medium-term inflation
expectations anchored; and



reinforce the point that in the
absence of complementary policy
responses on both demand and
supply sides, stronger monetary
policy actions are required.

59.


it has been decided to:

liquidity adjustment facility (laf) by

the laf, determined with a spread of

automatically adjusts to 7.0 per cent
with immediate effect.

(msf) rate
61.
the marginal standing facility
(msf) rate, determined with a spread
of 100 basis points above the repo rate,

guidance
65.
going forward, the monetary
policy stance will depend on the evolving
inflation trajectory, which, in turn, will
be determined by trends in domestic
growth and global commodity prices.
a change in stance will be motivated
by signs of a sustainable downturn in
inflation.
