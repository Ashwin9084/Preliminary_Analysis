monetary policy statement 2011-12
by
dr. d. subbarao
governor
introduction

pass-through of input price increases.
significantly, this is happening even as there
are visible signs of moderating growth,
particularly in capital goods production
and investment spending, suggesting that
cumulative monetary actions are beginning
to have an impact on demand.

the annual policy for 2011-12 is
set in conditions significantly different than
they were a year ago. last year’s policy
was made in an environment of incipient
domestic recovery amidst uncertainty about
the state of the global economy, a perception
that was reinforced with the precipitation
of the greek sovereign debt crisis a few
weeks later. while signs of inflation were
visible, they were driven primarily by food.
however, food price pressure spilling over
into more generalised inflation was clearly
a risk as the recovery consolidated and
domestic resource utilisation rose to levels
which stretched capacities. throughout the
year, the goal of monetary policy was to
nurture the recovery in the face of persistent
global uncertainty while trying to contain
the spillover of supply-side inflation.

3.
thus, three factors have shaped the
outlook and monetary strategy for 2011-12.
first, global commodity prices, which have
surged in recent months, are likely to, at best,
remain firm and may well increase further
over the course of the year. second, headline
and core inflation have significantly overshot
even the most pessimistic projections over
the past few months. in terms of the likely
trajectory of inflation over the year, the first
suggests that high inflation will persist and
may get worse. the second raises concerns
about inflationary expectations becoming
unhinged.

2.
the trend of moderating inflation
and consolidating growth in the second
and third quarters of 2010-11 justified the
calibrated policy approach of the reserve
bank. however, the resurgence of inflation
in the last quarter of 2010-11 was a matter of
concern. although the trigger was the sharp
uptrend in international commodity prices,
the fact that these were quickly passing
through into the entire range of domestic
manufactured goods indicated that pricing
power is significant. in other words, demand
has been strong enough to allow significant

4.
the third factor, countering these
forces, is the likely moderation in demand,
which should help reduce pricing power and
the extent of pass-through of commodity
prices. this cannot be ignored in the policy
calculation. however, a significant factor
influencing aggregate demand during the
year will be the fiscal situation. while
the budget estimates offered reassurance
of a rollback, the critical assumption that
petroleum and fertiliser subsidies would
be capped is bound to be seriously tested
1

at prevailing crude oil prices. even though
adjustment of administered retail prices may
add to inflation in the short run, the reserve
bank believes that this needs to be done as
soon as possible. otherwise, the consequent
increase in the fiscal deficit will counter the
moderating trend in aggregate demand.

ii sets out the outlook and projections for
growth, inflation and monetary aggregates.
section iii explains the stance of monetary
policy. section iv specifies the monetary
and liquidity measures, including the
modified operating procedures in the light
of the recommendations of the working
group on operating procedure of monetary
policy (chairman: shri deepak mohanty)
and the feedback received thereon.

5.
the monetary policy trajectory that
is being initiated in this annual statement
is based on the following premise. over
the long run, high inflation is inimical to
sustained growth as it harms investment by
creating uncertainty. current elevated rates
of inflation pose significant risks to future
growth. bringing them down, therefore,
even at the cost of some growth in the
short-run, should take precedence.

7.
part b covers developmental and
regulatory policies and is divided into six
sections: financial stability (section i),
interest rate policy (section ii), financial
markets (section iii), credit delivery and
financial inclusion (section iv), regulatory
and supervisory measures for commercial
banks (section v) and institutional
developments (section vi).

6.
against this backdrop, this
statement sets out the reserve bank’s
assessment of the current macroeconomic
situation and projections. it is organised in
two parts. part a covers monetary policy
and is divided into four sections. section i
provides an overview of global and domestic
macroeconomic developments. section

8.
part a of this statement should
be read and understood together with the
detailed review in macroeconomic and
monetary developments released yesterday
by the reserve bank.

global economy

2011, moderated in march 2011 on the back
of higher oil prices.

9.
the global economy during the
first quater of 2011 continued with the
momentum of late 2010. the global
manufacturing purchasing managers’ index
(pmi) for february 2011 was close to a
record high, while the global services pmi
recorded its fastest pace of expansion in
almost five years. although these indices
slipped somewhat in march 2011, they
signalled continuing expansion. however,
consumer confidence in major countries,
which improved during january-february

10.
gdp growth in the us, which was
strong at 3.1 per cent (q-o-q seasonally
adjusted annualised rate) in q4 of 2010,
slipped to 1.8 per cent reflecting a decline
in government spending, deceleration in
private consumption and increase in imports.
clearly, a number of weaknesses persist.
the us housing market remains weak. more
generally, unemployment rates continue
to remain elevated in major advanced
economies, albeit with some improvement
2

in the us. concerns about sovereign debt in
the euro area have now been reinforced by
developments in the us. finally, and most
importantly, commodity price increases
have accelerated, engendering global
inflationary fears and posing downside risks
to growth.

a direct impact on inflation in advanced
economies, despite substantial negative
output gaps. they have also accentuated
inflationary pressures in emes, which
were already experiencing strong revival
in demand. while major emes have been
tightening monetary policies for more than
a year now, the european central bank
has recently raised its policy rate - the first
central bank to do so among the major
advanced economies - after maintaining
them at historically low levels for almost
two years. central banks in other advanced
economies are also under pressure to
withdraw monetary accommodation. the
above trend poses appreciable downside
risks to global economic activity.

11.
the brent crude price surged
from an average of us$ 75 a barrel during
may-september 2010 to us$ 123 a barrel
by april 2011. the international monetary
fund's (imf) in its april 2011 world
economic outlook (weo) has assumed
us$ 107 a barrel for the full year 2011.
initially, oil prices were buoyed by strong
global demand and excessive liquidity.
since february 2011, oil prices have come
under further pressure on account of
apprehensions about supply disruptions
due to political developments in the middle
east and north african (mena) region.
the demand for oil is expected to increase
with the possibility of japan substituting
some of its shut-in nuclear power capacity
with oil-based generation, combined with
higher energy usage once reconstruction
gets underway.

domestic economy
14.
the indian economy is estimated
to have grown by 8.6 per cent during
2010-11. agricultural growth was above
trend, following a good monsoon. the
index of industrial production (iip), which
grew by 10.4 per cent during the first half of
2010-11, moderated subsequently, bringing
down the overall growth for april-february
2010-11 to 7.8 per cent. the main contributor
to this decline was a deceleration in the
capital goods sector. however, other
indicators, such as the manufacturing
pmi, tax collections, corporate sales and
earnings growth, credit off-take by industry
(other than infrastructure) and export
performance, suggested that economic
activity was strong.

12.
in the recent period, commodity
prices have been under pressure due to
strong demand from emerging market
economies (emes) and the financialisation
of commodity markets. global consumption
of most base metals is estimated to have
reached new highs in 2010. according to
the food and agriculture organisation
(fao), international food prices rose by
37 per cent (y-o-y) in march 2011, reflecting
both higher demand and weather related
supply disruptions. the increase in global
food prices was led by the prices of cereals
(60 per cent), edible oils (49 per cent) and
sugar (41 per cent).
13.

15.
according to the reserve bank’s
order books, inventories and capacity
utilisation survey (obicus), the order
books of manufacturing companies grew
by 7 per cent in october-december 2010 as
against 9 per cent in the previous quarter
indicating sustained demand albeit with
some moderation. the reserve bank’s

commodity prices are now exerting

march 2011 from 13.3-15.0 per cent in
april
2010.
over
the
same
period,
wpi
inflation
remained
elevated
reflecting
increases
in
non-food primary articles prices and
importantly, non-food manufactured product
prices. this led to a broad convergence
of wpi and cpi inflation by the end of
2010-11.

16.
leading indicators of services sector
suggest continuing growth momentum.
credit to the services sector grew by 24
per cent in 2010-11 as compared with 12.5
per cent in the previous year. other indicators
such as commercial vehicles production
and foreign tourist arrivals also showed an
acceleration. however, the services pmi for
march 2011 showed some moderation as
compared with the previous month.

19.
broad money supply (m3) growth at
15.9 per cent (year-on-year) during 2010-11
was lower than the reserve bank’s indicative
trajectory of 17 per cent due to slow deposit
growth and acceleration in currency
growth. the higher currency demand
slowed the money multiplier. consequently,
m3 growth slowed despite a significant
increase in reserve money. this suggests
that money supply growth was not a
contributing factor to inflation.

17.
inflation
was
the
primary
macroeconomic
concern
throughout
2010-11. it was driven by a combination
of factors, both structural and transitory.
based on drivers of inflation, the year
2010-11 can be broadly divided into three
periods. in the first period from april to july
2010, the increase in wholesale price index
(wpi) by 3.5 per cent was driven largely by
food items and the fuel and power group,
which together contributed more than 60
per cent of the increase in wpi. during the
second period from august to november
2010, while wpi showed a lower increase
of 1.8 per cent, more than 70 per cent of
the increase was contributed by food and
non-food primary articles and minerals.
in the third period from december 2010
to march 2011, wpi increased sharply by
3.4 per cent, driven mainly by fuel and
power group and non-food manufactured
products, which together contributed over
80 per cent of the increase in wpi. thus,
the inflationary pressures, which emanated
from food, clearly became generalised as
the year progressed.

20.
non-food credit growth, which had
been trending upwards from the beginning
of the year, reached an intra-year high of
24.2 per cent (year-on-year) in december
2010. it slowed down subsequently to
21.2 per cent by march 2011, which was
marginally higher than the reserve bank’s
indicative projection of 20 per cent.
21.
the reserve bank’s estimates show
that the total flow of financial resources from
banks, domestic non-bank and external
sources to the commercial sector during
2010-11, at `12,00,000 crore, was 12.3 per
cent higher than that in the previous year.
there was a decline in non-bank sources
of funds in 2010-11 as compared with
that in the previous year. the decline was
particularly noticeable in foreign direct
investment. however, this was more than
offset by the higher flow of funds from the
banking sector.

18.
as food price inflation moderated,
consumer price index (cpi) measures of
inflation declined to 8.8-9.1 per cent in

22.
data on sectoral deployment of
bank credit show significant increases in
4

credit flow to industry and services. within
industry, credit growth to infrastructure
was robust. credit flows improved in
respect of metals, textiles, engineering, food
processing, and gems and jewellery, among
others. within services, credit growth
accelerated to commercial real estate and
non-banking financial companies. housing
and vehicle loans recovered in 2010-11.

outpacing deposit growth contributed to tight
liquidity conditions. although a systemic
liquidity deficit was consistent with the
anti-inflationary stance of monetary policy,
the extent of tightness since october 2010
was outside the comfort level of (+)/(-) one
per cent of net demand and time liabilities
(ndtl) of scbs.
25.
the reserve bank initiated several
measures to ease the liquidity situation.
these were: (i) additional liquidity support
under the liquidity adjustment facility
(laf) to scbs up to one per cent of their
ndtl by temporary waiver of penal
interest for any shortfall in maintenance of
statutory liquidity ratio (slr) - for a brief
period the limit was two per cent of ndtl,
which was reduced to one per cent following
the permanent reduction in the slr;
(ii) reduction in the slr by one per cent;
(iii) conducting open market operations;
and (iv) conducting the second laf (slaf)
on a daily basis.

23.
the base rate system replaced the
benchmark prime lending rate (bplr)
system with effect from july 1, 2010. major
scheduled commercial banks (scbs),
constituting about 81 per cent of total banking
business, raised their base rates by 50-165
basis points between october 2010 and
march 2011. base rates of 64 major banks
with a share of around 98 per cent in
the total bank credit were in the range of
8.00-9.50 per cent (march 2011), reflecting
greater convergence in base rates
announced by major banks. the weighted
average lending rate in the banking system
was 10.5 per cent as at end-march 2010.
data from select banks indicate that the
weighted average yield on advances,
which is a proxy measure for effective
lending rates, is projected to increase from
9.7 per cent in 2010-11 to 10.3 per cent in
2011-12. this suggests that the base rate
system has improved the transmission from
the policy rates to banks’ lending rates.

26.
liquidity conditions have eased
significantly in recent weeks, following
a sharp reduction in government cash
balances and moderation in the creditdeposit ratio of banks. consequently, net
liquidity injected by the reserve bank
through its repo operations declined from a
daily average of around `1,20,000 crore in
december 2010 to around `81,000 crore in
march 2011. the average daily net liquidity
injected by the reserve bank fell sharply to
`19,000 crore in april 2011 as government
balances moved from positive to negative.

24.
after remaining in surplus for 18
months, liquidity conditions transited to a
deficit mode towards end-may 2010. this
was the consequence of a large build-up
in government cash balances as a result
of higher than expected proceeds from
spectrum auctions. beginning october
2010, liquidity conditions became even
tighter. both frictional factors such as the
above-normal build up in government cash
balances and structural factors such as high
currency demand growth and credit growth

27.
in order to facilitate better liquidity
management, the reserve bank extended
the two liquidity easing measures, viz.,
additional liquidity support under the laf
to scbs up to one per cent of their ndtl
and the slaf on a daily basis up to may 6,
2011.
5

28.
yields on government securities
eased during the first quarter of 2010-11 in
expectation of an improved fiscal position
due to higher than anticipated revenues
in spectrum auctions. yields hardened
thereafter till january 2011 on account of
increase in inflation and consequent rate
hike expectations as well as tight liquidity
conditions. yields, however, moderated in
february and march 2011 on the back of
improvement in liquidity conditions, lower
than expected budgeted fiscal deficit and
the projected market borrowing programme
for the first half of 2011-12. significantly,
the stability of long-term yields, despite the
current high rates of inflation, suggests that
inflationary expectations remain anchored.

in the range of `44.03-47.58 per us dollar.
on an average basis, the 6-currency
real effective exchange rate (reer)
appreciated by 12.7 per cent in 2010-11,
the 30-currency reer by 4.5 per cent and
the 36-currency reer by 7.7 per cent.
31.
the current account deficit (cad)
during april-december 2010 was us$ 38.9
billion, up from us$ 25.5 billion during the
corresponding period of 2009. during the
fourth quarter of 2010-11, exports grew at a
robust pace of 46.6 per cent, while growth
in imports decelerated to 22.8 per cent.
consequently, the cad, which was 3.1 per
cent during april-december 2010, is now
estimated to moderate to around 2.5 per cent
of gdp for 2010-11 as against 2.8 per cent
during 2009-10.

29.
the union budget for 2011-12 has
emphasised the government’s commitment
to carry on the process of fiscal
consolidation by budgeting a lower fiscal
deficit (4.6 per cent of gdp in 2011-12 as
compared with 5.1 per cent in 2010-11).
the revenue deficit to gdp ratio is estimated
to remain unchanged at 3.4 per cent
in 2011-12.

32.
although net capital inflows
increased significantly to us$ 52.7 billion
during april-december 2010 (us$ 37.6
billion a year ago), the composition
shifted towards volatile flows such as
fii investments and trade credits. net
inflows under fdi were lower. as the cad
is expected to be significant in 2011-12,
the sustainability of financing it becomes
important.

30.
during 2010-11, the rupee dollar
exchange rate showed two-way movements

ii. outlook and projections
global outlook

in emes is also expected to decelerate on
account of monetary tightening and rising
commodity prices.

growth
33.
the global recovery is expected
to sustain in 2011, although growth will
slow down marginally from its pace
in 2010. according to the imf weo
(april 2011), global growth is likely to
moderate from 5.0 per cent in 2010 to
4.4 per cent in 2011. growth is projected to
decelerate in advanced economies due to
waning of impact of   fiscal stimulus, and
high oil and other commodity prices. growth

inflation
34.
the imf weo (april 2011)
projects global cpi inflation to rise from
3.7 per cent in 2010 to 4.5 per cent in 2011.
while advanced economies face inflationary
pressures from high commodity prices,
emes face pressures from both strong
domestic demand and high commodity
prices. cpi inflation in the advanced
6

economies is projected to increase from
1.6 per cent in 2010 to 2.2 per cent in 2011,
and in the emes from 6.2 per cent to 6.9
per cent.

of a normal monsoon by the india
meteorological department (imd) during
2011, agriculture growth is likely to revert
to its trend growth from the higher base
of last year. second, the pace of industrial
activity has been slowing mainly due to the
impact of past monetary policy actions and
high input prices. external demand too may
slow if global recovery slackens.

domestic outlook
growth
35.
real gdp growth for 2010-11 was
estimated at 8.6 per cent. signs of moderation,
however, emerged in the second half of
the year. particularly significant were the
slowdown in capital goods production and
investment spending. going forward, high oil
and other commodity prices and the impact
of the anti-inflationary monetary stance will
weigh on growth. most business confidence
surveys conducted by various agencies
show a decline in business confidence.
the reserve bank’s ios conducted during
march 2011, as mentioned earlier, indicates
some moderation in business expectations
for the quarter ended june 2011.

37.
based on the assumption of a
normal monsoon and crude oil prices
averaging us$ 110 a barrel over 2011-12, the
baseline projection of real gdp growth for
2011-12 for policy purposes is placed at
around 8 per cent. the growth is projected
to be in the range of 7.4 per cent and 8.5
per cent in 2011-12 with 90 per cent
probability (chart 1).
inflation
38.
the reserve bank's forecasts
systematically under-predicted year-end
inflation during 2010-11. even after a
significant upward revision from 5.5
per cent to 7 per cent in the third quarter
policy review in january 2011 and then to

36.
growth is expected to moderate
in 2011-12 from its pace in 2010-11. first,
notwithstanding the preliminary indication

7

8 per cent in the mid-quarter review in
march 2011, the forecasts remained below
the provisional number of 9 per cent for
march 2011. the analysis in the previous
section reveals that the surge in headline
inflation, despite an overall moderation
in food inflation, was the combination of
two factors: an unanticipated increase in
oil and commodity prices, including the
large upward revision in administered coal
prices in march 2011, and demand pressures
reflected in significant increase in inflation
in non-food manufactured products.

42.
fourth, there have been sharp
increases in the prices of several important
industrial raw materials, such as minerals,
fibres, especially cotton, rubber, besides
coal and crude oil. in addition, there is also
upward pressure on wages. the extent to
which the increase in input prices translates
into output prices will have an influence on
the inflation path.
43.
fifth, while the south-west monsoon
2011 is expected to be normal, its impact
on moderation in food inflation may be
less than commensurate, given a strong
structural component in food inflation and
elevated global food price situation.

39.
against this backdrop, several
factors will play a role in the inflation
outlook, going forward. first, there is
a significant suppressed component of
inflation as the increase in crude oil prices
has not been passed on completely. the
last increase in administered mineral oil
prices was effected in june 2010 when the
indian basket of crude oil was us$ 74.3 per
barrel. subsequently, it increased to us$
110.7 per barrel in march 2011. similarly,
administered electricity prices have not gone
up even as input prices, particularly those
of coal, have increased significantly. hence,
the timing of changes in administered prices
as indicated above will have a significant
influence on the inflation path.

44.
sixth, even though demand pressures
were evidently strong enough to induce the
generalisation of commodity price increases in
recent months, signs of moderation in growth
suggest that this driver of inflation will ease
in the coming months. the cumulative impact
of monetary actions over the past 15 months
will continue to be felt over the course of 201112, contributing to moderation in both growth
and inflation rates.
45.
keeping in view the domestic
demand-supply balance and the global trends
in commodity prices and the likely demand
scenario, the baseline projection for wpi
inflation for march 2012 is placed at 6 per
cent with an upward bias (chart 2). inflation
is expected to remain at an elevated level
in the first half of the year due to expected
pass-through of increase in international
petroleum product prices to domestic prices
and continued pass-through of high input
prices into manufactured products.

40.
second, the outlook for crude oil
prices in the near future is uncertain, given
the geo-political situation in the mena
region. in any case, the likelihood of oil
prices moderating significantly is low. the
imf weo (april 2011) has assumed a
baseline average crude oil price of us$ 107
per barrel for 2011 and us$ 108 per barrel
for 2012.

46.
notwithstanding
the
current
inflation scenario, it is important to
recognise that in the last decade, the average
inflation rate, measured in terms of wpi and
cpi, had moderated to around 5.5 per cent.
more specifically, non-food manufacturing

inflation, which the reserve bank uses as
an indicator of demand pressures and is
the most responsive to monetary actions,
averaged 4.0 per cent over this period.
a period of low inflation preceded the
high-growth phase in 2003-08, which was
in turn characterised by high investmentgdp and declining fiscal deficit-gdp ratios.
inflation remained moderate in the early part
of the high-growth phase, but increased in
the period immediately preceding the global
financial crisis, reflecting the emergence of
domestic bottlenecks.

behaviour of the non-food manufacturing
component. this will be in line with the
medium-term objective of 3.0 per cent
inflation consistent with india’s broader
integration into the global economy. the
achievement of this objective will be helped
by concerted policy actions and resource
allocations to address domestic bottlenecks,
particularly on the food and infrastructure
fronts.
monetary aggregates
48.
keeping in view the need to balance
the resource requirements of the private
sector and the budgeted government
borrowings, m3 growth for 2011-12, for
policy purposes, is placed at 16.0 per cent.
consistent with this, aggregate deposits
of scbs are projected to grow by 17.0
per cent. growth in non-food credit of
scbs is projected at 19.0 per cent. these
monetary projections are consistent with
the growth and inflation outlook. as always,
the numbers are provided as indicative
projections and not as targets.

47.
based on cross-country as well as
domestic experience, the reserve bank
is strongly of the view that controlling
inflation is imperative to sustaining growth
over the medium-term. this is a critical
attribute of a favourable investment climate,
on which growth sustainability depends.
fiscal consolidation will also contribute
to improving the investment climate.
accordingly, the conduct of monetary
policy will continue to condition and contain
perceptions of inflation in the range of
4.0-4.5 per cent, with particular focus on the
9

risk factors

challenge, given the subsidy burden arising
out of high international prices, the effect of
which has not been completely passed on.
the government, therefore, needs to focus
on the quality of expenditure to sustain the
fiscal consolidation process, which, in turn,
will help contain aggregate demand.

49.
the indicative projections of growth
and inflation for 2011-12 are subject to
several risks as detailed below:
i)
there are several downside risks
to global growth at this stage such as
(a) sovereign debt problem in the euro area
periphery intensifying and spreading to the
core; (b) high commodity prices, especially
oil, impacting the global recovery;
(c) abrupt rise in long-term interest rates
in highly indebted advanced economies
with implications for fiscal path; and
(d) accentuation of inflationary pressures
in emes. should global recovery slacken
significantly, it will impact the indian
economy through the trade, finance and
confidence channels.

iv)
food inflation, after remaining
in double digits for more than two years,
declined to a single digit rate in november
2010. however, despite normal monsoon
in 2010, food price inflation did not show
the usual moderation. furthermore,
vegetable prices also did not exhibit the
usual seasonal pattern in 2010-11. this
suggests that supply is not able to keep
pace with the growing demand. given the
spike in international food prices even in
significantly traded food items, imports do
not provide an option to cushion domestic
prices. persistently high food prices are
likely to exert sustained upward pressure
on wages, thus transmitting through to
wider cost pressure on prices.

ii)
global commodity prices are a
significant risk factor for both domestic
growth and inflation. the future path of
crude oil prices is uncertain. brent crude
crossed us$ 120 per barrel in april 2011.
metal prices, which witnessed some decline
around mid-march 2011, reflecting the
weakening of investor confidence due to
the japanese disaster, have resumed their
upward trend.

v)
if oil and commodity prices remain
elevated, the cad will remain significant.
financing of cad is going to be a challenge
as advanced countries begin exiting from
their accommodative monetary policy
stance. this could slow down capital inflows
to emes, including india, as investors
rebalance their portfolios.

iii)
the budgeted fiscal deficit for
2011-12 gives some comfort on the demand
front. however, achieving the fiscal
consolidation targets for 2011-12 could be a

iii. the policy stance
50.
the reserve bank began exiting
from the crisis driven accommodative
policy in october 2009. since then, the cash
reserve ratio (crr) has been raised by 100
basis points. policy rates have been raised
eight times - the repo rate under the laf by
200 basis points and the reverse repo rate by
250 basis points. the effective tightening in

policy rates has been of 350 basis points as
the liquidity in the system transited from a
surplus to a deficit mode.
51.
the monetary policy stance in
2010-11 was calibrated on the basis of the
domestic growth-inflation dynamics amidst
persistent global uncertainties. against
the backdrop of global and domestic
10

macroeconomic
conditions,
outlook
and risks, the policy stance for 2011-12
has been guided by the following major
considerations.

respect to capital goods and investment
activity. growth is expected to decelerate
from 8.6 per cent in 2010-11 to around 8 per
cent in 2011-12, which should contribute to
some easing of demand-side inflationary
pressures, particularly in the second half,
as the full impact of monetary tightening
is realised. however, even as this trend
unfolds, persistently high rates of inflation
raise the risks of inflationary expectations
becoming unhinged.

52.
first,
notwithstanding
some
moderation in the second half of the year,
inflation has persistently remained much
above the comfort level of the reserve
bank. the sharp increase in non-food
manufactured product inflation towards
the latter part of the year suggests strong
underlying demand pressures, which are
helping producers to pass through input
price increases. the uncertainty in global
commodity prices poses a major risk to
domestic inflation as the significant increase
in global crude prices that has already taken
place, is yet to be passed through to domestic
prices. the impact of monetary tightening
already undertaken by the reserve bank is
still unfolding. however, considering the
overall inflation scenario, there is a clear
need to persist with the anti-inflationary
stance.

54.
against this backdrop, the stance of
monetary policy of the reserve bank will
be as follows:

53.
second,
while
the
growth
momentum remained relatively firm during
2010-11, signs of moderation emerged in
the latter half of the year, particularly with

•

maintain an interest rate environment
that moderates inflation and anchors
inflation expectations.

•

foster an environment of price stability
that is conducive to sustaining growth
in the medium-term coupled with
financial stability.

•

manage liquidity to ensure that it
remains broadly in balance, with neither
a large surplus diluting monetary
transmission nor a large deficit choking
off fund flows.

iv. monetary measures
report of the working group on
operating procedure of monetary policy

feedback received, it has been decided to
make the following changes in the extant
operating procedures of monetary policy:

55.
following the first quarter review
of monetary policy for 2010-11 (july 2010),
the reserve bank constituted a working
group to review the operating procedure
of monetary policy in india (chairman:
shri deepak mohanty). the report of the
group was placed in public domain on march
15, 2011 for feedback and comments.

(i) the weighted average overnight call
money rate will be the operating target
of monetary policy of the reserve
bank.
(ii) there will henceforth be only one
independently varying policy rate
and that will be the repo rate. the
transition to a single independently
varying policy rate is expected to more

56.
based
on
the
group’s
recommendations and in the light of the
11

accurately signal the monetary policy
stance.

operating procedures as set out above, the
reserve bank announces the following
policy measures:

(iii) the reverse repo rate will continue to
be operative but it will be pegged at a
fixed 100 basis points below the repo
rate. hence, it will no longer be an
independent rate.

repo rate
59.
l

(iv) a new marginal standing facility
(msf) will be instituted from which
scbs can borrow overnight up to
one per cent of their respective
ndtl. the rate of interest on amount
accessed from this facility will be 100
basis points above the repo rate. a
notification is being issued separately
providing for a general waiver of
default from slr compliance, freeing
banks from the obligation of seeking
a specific waiver of default as is the
case now. this facility is expected
to contain volatility in the overnight
inter-bank market.

it has been decided to:
increase the repo rate under the liquidity
adjustment facility (laf) by 50 basis
points from 6.75 per cent to 7.25 per
cent with immediate effect.

reverse repo rate
60.
the reverse repo rate under the laf,
determined with a spread of 100 basis point
below the repo rate, automatically adjusts to
6.25 per cent with immediate effect.
marginal standing facility (msf) rate
61.
the marginal standing facility
(msf) rate, determined with a spread of
100 basis points above the repo rate, stands
calibrated at 8.25 per cent. this rate will
come into effect on operationalisation of the
msf.

(v) as per the above scheme, the revised
corridor will have a fixed width of 200
basis points. the repo rate will be in the
middle. the reverse repo rate will be
100 basis points below it and the msf
rate 100 basis points above it.

bank rate
62.
the bank rate has been retained at
6.0 per cent.

(vi) while the width of the corridor is fixed
at 200 basis points, the reserve bank
will have the flexibility to change the
corridor, should monetary conditions
so warrant.

cash reserve ratio
63.
the cash reserve ratio (crr) of
scheduled banks has been retained at 6.0
per cent of their ndtl.

57.
the above changes in the operating
framework other than at (iv) above will
come into force with immediate effect.
change under (iv) will come into effect
from the fortnight beginning may 7, 2011.
detailed guidelines in this regard are being
issued separately.

savings bank deposit interest rate
64.
as indicated in the second quarter
review of monetary policy 2010-11, the
discussion paper delineating the pros and
cons of deregulating the savings bank
deposit interest rate was placed on the
reserve bank’s website on april 28, 2011
for feedback from the general public.

58.
on the basis of the policy stance
as outlined in section iii, and changes in
12

guidance

65.
in the recent period, the spread
between the savings deposit and term
deposit rates has widened significantly.
therefore, pending a final decision on
the issue of deregulation of savings
bank deposit interest rate, it has been
decided to :
•

68.
the bank's baseline inflation
projections, as indicated in chart 2 (page 9),
are that the inflation rate will remain close
to the march 2011 level over the first half of
2011-12, before declining. these projections
factor in an upward revision of petrol and
diesel prices. while the persistence of
inflation over the next few months has been  
incorporated in this policy, the reserve
bank will continue to persevere with its
anti-inflationary stance.

increase the savings bank deposit
interest rate from the present 3.5
per cent to 4.0 per cent with immediate
effect.

66.
detailed instructions in this regard
to banks are being issued separately.

mid-quarter review of monetary policy
69.
the next mid-quarter review
of monetary policy for 2011-12 will be
announced through a press release on
thursday, june 16, 2011.

expected outcomes
67.
the monetary policy actions in this
review are expected to:
i)

contain inflation by reining in demand
side pressures, and anchor inflationary
expectations; and

policy 2011-12

the first quarter review of
monetary policy for 2011-12 is scheduled

part b. developmental and regulatory policies
71.
this part of the statement reviews
the progress in various developmental and
regulatory policy measures announced
by the reserve bank in the recent policy
statements and also sets out new measures.

(bcbs) and financial stability board (fsb),
which are engaged in setting standards and
formulating policies for safeguarding the
financial system.
73.
the reserve bank has already
indicated that it would implement the reform
measures under basel iii framework, which
are applicable to banks in india. apart from
reforms in the banking sector, the reserve
bank has also been pursuing reforms in
several other areas. it has been actively
pursuing the development of various
segments of the financial market. in the
recent period, financial inclusion has also
been recognised as a key objective of policy.
in addition, greater emphasis is being
placed on the quality of service rendered
by banks to their customers. information
technology and payment and settlement
services have a crucial role in ensuring not
only efficient banking services but also in
financial stability, financial inclusion and
customer service. it has, therefore, been the
endeavour of the reserve bank to promote
the use of information technology in banks
and provide secure and efficient payment
and settlement services in the country.

72.
the global financial crisis has
exposed areas of vulnerability in the financial
sector and policy initiatives are underway to
strengthen financial stability. some of the
key issues that have arisen in the banking
sector are inadequate loss-absorbing capital;
insufficient liquidity buffers; excessive
build-up of leverage; procyclicality of
financial markets; focus on firm-specific
supervision and neglect of macro-prudential
supervision of system-wide risks; moral
hazard from too-big-to-fail institutions; weak
governance practices; poor understanding of
complex products; and shortcomings in risk
management. with a view to addressing these
issues, various international bodies, national
supervisors and policymakers are engaged
in instituting various reform measures at
the global and at the national levels. the
reserve bank has been playing an active role
in various international fora, including g-20,
basel committee on banking supervision

healthy. the stress testing on credit, market
and liquidity risks indicated a reasonable
degree of resilience of the banking sector
in india. the report also pointed to some
discernible soft spots such as volatile capital
flows, stretched fiscal conditions, persisting
inflationary pressure, deterioration in asset
quality of banks, regulatory gaps in the nonbanking financial sector, and underscored
the need for setting up a robust macroprudential framework for identification of
systemic risks.

74.
it was announced in the second
quarter review of monetary policy of
november 2010 that the financial stability
report (fsr) would be regularly published in
june and december every year. accordingly,
the second fsr was released by the reserve
bank in december 2010. the report brought
out that the financial sector remained stressfree notwithstanding intermittent volatility,
especially in the equity and foreign exchange
markets. financial institutions remained

some banks requested for extension of
time. accordingly, banks were permitted
to change the benchmark and methodology
used in the computation of their base rates
for a further period of six months, i.e., up to
june 30, 2011.

75.
the reserve bank introduced the
base rate system from july 2010, which
replaced the benchmark prime lending rate
(bplr) system. banks were given time till
end-december 2010 to select the appropriate
benchmark and other cost parameters for

in february 2011 for public comments.
the guidelines are being finalised, based
on feedback from the public, extensive
consultations with the stakeholders and
deliberations in the technical advisory
committee
on
financial
markets.
accordingly, it is proposed:

interest rate futures
76.
it was indicated in the second
quarter review of november 2010 that
exchange traded interest rate futures (irfs)
on 5-year and 2-year notional coupon
bearing central government securities and
91-day treasury bills would be introduced
after taking into account the experiences of
cash-settled irf regimes in other countries.
the irf trading on 91-day treasury bills
with cash settlement in indian rupees was
permitted by the reserve bank in march
2011. the guidelines for 5-year and 2-year
irfs are being finalised in consultation
with the securities and exchange board of
india (sebi).

•

to issue the final guidelines on plain
vanilla single-name cds for corporate
bonds for resident entities, after taking
into consideration the feedback/
suggestions received from market
participants, by end-may 2011.

78.
the product will be launched once the
necessary market infrastructure is in place.
review of short sale in government
securities

introduction of credit default swaps

79.
based on the recommendations of the
technical group on the central government
securities market, intra-day short selling in
central government securities was permitted
in february 2006. subsequently, based on
the feedback received, the period of short
sale was extended to five days in january
2007. with a view to providing a fillip to the
irf market and the term repo market, it is
proposed:

77.
it was announced in the second
quarter review of
october 2009 to
introduce plain vanilla over-the-counter
(otc) single-name credit default swap
(cds) for corporate bonds for resident
entities, subject to appropriate safeguards.
consequently, an internal working group
was constituted to finalise the operational
framework in consultation with market
participants. the final report of the internal
working group and draft guidelines on cds
were placed on the reserve bank’s website

•

15

to extend the period of short sale from
the existing five days to a maximum
period of three months.

(ii) permitting use of cost reduction
structures, both under the contracted
exposures and past performance routes,
subject to certain safeguards.

extension of dvp iii facility to
gilt account holders
80.
consequent upon the announcement
made in the mid-term review of monetary
and credit policy for the year 2003-04, the
settlement of transactions in government
securities through clearing corporation
of india ltd. (ccil) was switched over to
delivery versus payment (dvp) iii mode
with effect from april 2, 2004. however, the
dvp iii mode of settlement was not extended
to gilt account holders who maintained their
balances with the custodian bank/primary
dealer who, in turn, held these securities
in its constituent subsidiary general ledger
(csgl) account with the reserve bank.
with the stabilisation of the transaction
and settlement infrastructure, it is now
proposed:
•

cancellation and rebooking under the
portfolio investment scheme by fiis
83.
currently, foreign institutional
investors (fiis) are permitted to cancel and
rebook 2 per cent of the market value of the
portfolio as at the beginning of the financial
year. in view of the large positions held by
the fiis and considering the increased depth
of the indian forex market to absorb the
impact on the exchange rate, it is proposed:
•

to allow fiis to cancel and rebook up
to 10 per cent of the market value of
the portfolio as at the beginning of the
financial year.

84.
detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued separately.

to extend dvp iii facility to transactions
by the gilt account holders (excluding
transactions between the gilt account
holders of the same custodian) so that
the gilt account holders get the benefit
of efficient use of funds and securities.

facilitating rupee trade –
hedging facilities for non-resident entities
85.
the provisions under the foreign
exchange management act (fema),
1999 do not permit non-residents to hedge
their currency exposure with authorised
dealer (ad) banks in india, in respect of
exports and imports invoiced in indian
rupees. in order to facilitate greater use
of indian rupee in trade transactions, it is
proposed:

81.
detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued shortly.
guidelines on over-the-counter
forex derivatives
82.
it was proposed in the second
quarter review of november 2010 to issue
final guidelines on otc foreign exchange
derivatives by end-november 2010.
accordingly, comprehensive guidelines
on otc foreign exchange derivatives
and overseas hedging of commodity
price and freight risks were issued in
december 2010. the important elements
of the revised guidelines, which became
effective february 1, 2011, are (i) allowing
embedded cross currency option in the
case of foreign currency-rupee swaps; and

•

that in respect of exports and imports
invoiced in indian rupees, non-resident
importers and exporters can hedge their
currency risk with ad banks in india
through their bankers having rupee
vostro accounts in india. the contracts
would be on a deliverable basis.

86.
the operational details will be
finalised and notified in consultation with
the stakeholders.
16

financial market infrastructure

fema. keeping this in view, a committee
(chairperson: smt. k.j. udeshi) comprising
the representatives of various stakeholders
has been set up. the committee will identify
areas for streamlining and simplifying the
procedure so as to remove the operational
impediments, and assess the level of
efficiency in the functioning of authorised
persons, including the infrastructure created
by them. the committee is expected to
submit its report within three months.

committee for review of procedures
relating to facilities to individuals –
residents/nris and pios
87.
the reserve bank recognises
the need for facilitating genuine foreign
exchange transactions by individuals –
residents/non-resident indians (nris) and
persons of indian origin (pios) – under
the current regulatory framework of

iv. credit delivery and financial inclusion
credit flow to the micro, small and
medium enterprises sector

rural credit institutions
licensing of co-operatives

high level task force on msmes

89.
in terms of the recommendations
of the committee on financial sector
assessment (chairman: dr. rakesh mohan
and co-chairman: shri ashok chawla)
and as proposed in the annual policy
statement of april 2009, the work relating
to licensing of unlicensed state and central
co-operative banks in a non-disruptive
manner, in consultation with national bank
for agriculture and rural development
(nabard), was initiated. subsequent to the
issuance of revised guidelines on licensing
of state co-operative banks (stcbs)/district
central co-operative banks (dccbs),
10 stcbs and 144 dccbs were licensed,
bringing down the number of unlicensed
stcbs from 17 to 7 and unlicensed dccbs
from 296 to 152 as on march 31, 2011.

88.
as indicated in the second quarter
review of november 2010, the reserve
bank, based on the recommendations of
the high level task force on micro, small
and medium enterprises (msmes), issued
guidelines in june 2010, advising scheduled
commercial banks that the allocation of
60 per cent of micro and small enterprises
(mses) advances to the micro enterprises
was to be achieved in stages, viz., 50 per cent
in the year 2010-11, 55 per cent in the year
2011-12 and 60 per cent in the year 2012-13.
further, banks were mandated to achieve
a 10 per cent annual growth in the number
of micro enterprise accounts and a 20 per
cent year-on-year growth in credit to the
mse sector. the reserve bank is closely
monitoring the achievement of targets by
banks on a half-yearly basis, i.e., march
and september each year. a suitable format
has been devised by the reserve bank to
capture and monitor the achievement of the
targets by banks and the same are regularly
reviewed at the highest level. banks, which
lag behind in achieving the targets, have
been mandated to submit an action plan to
achieve the prescribed targets.

revival of the rural co-operative
credit structure
90.
the government of india, based
on the recommendations of the task
force on revival of rural co-operative
credit institutions (chairman: prof. a.
vaidyanathan) and in consultation with
the state governments, had approved a
package for revival of the short-term rural
17

co-operative credit structure. as envisaged
in the package, 25 states have entered into
memorandum of understanding (mou) with
the government of india and nabard
and 20 states have amended their respective
state co-operative societies acts. as on
february 28, 2011, an aggregate amount
of `8,460 crore was released by nabard
for recapitalisation of primary agricultural
credit societies (pacs) in 16 states as the
government of india’s share under the
revival package.

the reserve bank (chairman: shri y. h.
malegam) was constituted to study issues
and concerns in the mfi sector. the
committee submitted its report in january
2011, which was placed in public domain.
the committee, inter alia, recommended
(i) creation of a separate category of
nbfc-mfis; (ii) a margin cap and
an interest rate cap on individual
loans; (iii) transparency in interest
charges; (iv) lending by not more than
two mfis to individual borrowers;
(v) creation of one or more credit
information bureaus; (vi) establishment
of a proper system of grievance redressal
procedure by mfis; (vii) creation of one
or more “social capital funds”; and (viii)
continuation of categorisation of bank loans
to mfis, complying with the regulation
laid down for nbfc-mfis, under the
priority sector. the recommendations of
the committee were discussed with all
stakeholders, including the government
of india, select state governments,
major nbfcs working as mfis, industry
associations of mfis working in the
country, other smaller mfis, and major
banks. in the light of the feedback received,
it has been decided:

financial inclusion through
grass-root co-operatives
91.
it was proposed in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010 to constitute a
committee comprising representatives from
the reserve bank, nabard and a few state
governments to study the functioning of
well-run pacs, large adivasi multi-purpose
co-operative societies (lamps), farmers
service societies (fss) and thrift and credit
co-operative societies set up under the
parallel self-reliant co-operative societies
acts to gather information on their working
and assess their potential to contribute to
financial inclusion. the regional offices of
the reserve bank have since given their
inputs. analysis, consolidation of data and
preparation of state-wise reports are in
progress and are expected to be completed
by end-july 2011.
malegam committee recommendations
92.
in the wake of the andhra pradesh
micro finance crisis in 2010, concerns were
expressed by various stakeholders and the
need was felt for more rigorous regulation
of non-banking financial companies
(nbfcs) functioning as micro finance
institutions (mfis). as indicated in the
second quarter review of november 2010,
a sub-committee of the central board of

nbfcs working as mfis on or after
april 1, 2011, will be eligible for
classification as priority sector loans
under respective category of indirect
finance only if the prescribed percentage
of their total assets are in the nature of
"qualifying assets" and they adhere to
the "pricing of interest" guidelines to be
issued in this regard;

•

that a “qualifying asset’’ is required

to satisfy the criteria of (i) loan
disbursed by an mfi to a borrower
with a rural household annual income
not exceeding `60,000 or urban and
semi-urban household income not
exceeding `1,20,000; (ii) loan amount
not to exceed `35,000 in the first cycle
and `50,000 in subsequent cycles;
(iii) total indebtedness of the borrower
not to exceed `50,000; (iv) tenure
of loan not to be less than 24 months
for loan amount in excess of `15,000
without prepayment penalty; (iv) loan
to be extended without collateral;
(v) aggregate amount of loan, given
for income generation, not to be less
than 75 per cent of the total loans
given by the mfis; and (vi) loan to
be repayable by weekly, fortnightly or
monthly instalments at the choice of
the borrower;
•

that banks should ensure a margin cap
of 12 per cent and an interest rate cap
of 26 per cent for their lending to be
eligible to be classified as priority
sector loans;

•

that loans by mfis can also be extended
to individuals outside the self-help
group (shg)/joint liability group (jlg)
mechanism; and

•

that bank loans to other nbfcs would
not be reckoned as priority sector loans
with effect from april 1, 2011.

to relook at the definition of the priority
sector, especially when bank finance was
being routed through other agencies. it is,
therefore, proposed:
•

to appoint a committee to re-examine
the existing classification and suggest
revised guidelines with regard to
priority sector lending classification.

financial inclusion plan for banks
95.
as indicated in the second quarter
review of november 2010, all public and
private sector banks were advised to put in
place a board approved three-year financial
inclusion plans (fips) and submit them to
the reserve bank by march 2010. these
banks have since prepared and submitted
their fips containing targets for march
2011, 2012 and 2013, to the reserve bank.
these plans broadly include self-set targets
in respect of rural brick and mortar branches
opened; business correspondents (bcs)
employed; coverage of unbanked villages
with population above 2,000 as also other
unbanked villages with population below
2,000 through branches/bcs/other modes;
no-frill accounts opened including through
bc-ict; kisan credit cards (kccs) and
general credit cards (gccs) issued; and
other specific products designed by them to
cater to the financially excluded segments.
96.
the implementation of these plans
is being closely monitored by the reserve
bank on a quarterly basis. the analysis of
progress reports of above plans received from
all public and private sector banks shows
that during the period april 2010 to march
2011, banks opened 5,214 new branches,
deployed 25,403 bcs/customer service
providers (csps) and provided banking
services in 43,337 villages. out of these,
525 villages were covered through rural
brick and mortar branches, 42,506 villages

93.
detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued separately.
redefining the priority sector
94.
the
malegam
committee
recommended that the existing guidelines
on bank lending to the priority sector be
revisited. requests were also received
from various quarters in the recent past
19

through bcs and 306 villages through other
modes such as atms and mobile vans. it is
important to note that banks covered 24,066
villages with population above 2,000, in
addition to covering 19,271 villages with
population below 2,000.

domestic scbs are being mandated:
•

to allocate at least 25 per cent of the
total number of branches to be opened
during a year to unbanked rural (tier 5
and tier 6) centres.

urban co-operative banks

branch authorisation policy

licenses for setting up new urban
co-operative banks

97.
domestic scheduled commercial
banks (excluding regional rural banks
[rrbs]) were permitted in december
2009 to open branches in tier 3 to tier
6 centres (with population up to 49,999)
without prior permission of the reserve
bank. however, prior authorisation from
the reserve bank was required for opening
of branches in tier 1 and tier 2 centres
which was granted based, inter alia, on the
(i) number of branches opened in tier 3 to
tier 6 centres under general permission;
(ii) branches proposed to be opened in underbanked districts in under-banked states;
and (iii) bank's performance in areas of
financial inclusion and customer service. it
was observed that on an average scheduled
commercial banks (scbs) opened about
20 per cent of the total number of new
branches in rural centres (tier 5 and tier
6) in the last two years.

99.
as announced in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010, an
expert committee (chairman: shri y. h.
malegam) was constituted in october 2010
with representations from all stakeholders
for studying the advisability of granting
licenses for setting up new urban
co-operative banks (ucbs) under section
22 of the banking regulation act, 1949
[as applicable to co-operative societies
(aacs)]. the committee will also look into
the feasibility of an umbrella organisation for
the ucb sector. the committee is expected
to submit its report by end-june 2011.
financing of self-help group/joint
liability group by ucbs
100. with a view to further expanding
the outreach of ucbs and opening an
additional channel for promoting financial
inclusion, which would also help the ucbs
in achieving the sub-target of lending to
weaker sections, it is proposed:

98.
there is a need to step up the
opening of branches in rural areas so as to
improve banking penetration and financial
inclusion rapidly and meet the targets
set out for providing banking services in
villages with population over 2,000. the
fips submitted by banks indicate that
banks propose to use bcs in a big way to
reach out to unbanked villages. keeping in
view the goal of bringing banking services
to identified 72,800 villages by march 2012
and thereafter progressively to all villages
over a period of time, there is a need for
opening of more brick and mortar branches,
besides the use of bcs. accordingly,

•

to permit ucbs to lend to shgs/jlgs;
and

•

to keep lending to shgs out of the
norm on unsecured advances.

exposure of ucbs to housing,
real estate and commercial real estate
101.
pursuant to the announcements
made in the second quarter review of
november 2010, ucbs were permitted to
lend up to 10 per cent of their total assets
20

to housing, real estate and commercial real
estate and an additional 5 per cent of total
assets for purchase and construction of
dwelling units costing up to `10 lakh.
keeping in view the representations received
from ucbs and their associations that they
are finding it difficult to use the additional
limit of 5 per cent of total assets due to the
high cost of dwelling units, it is proposed:
•

ucbs were allowed the facility of
indian financial network (infinet)
membership, current and subsidiary
general ledger (sgl) accounts with
the reserve bank and real time gross
settlement (rtgs) membership to well
managed and financially sound ucbs
having a minimum net worth of `25 crore.
in order to further enable ucbs to serve
their customers better, it is now proposed:

to permit ucbs to utilise the
additional 5 per cent of their total
assets permitted earlier, for housing
loans up to `15 lakh.

•

internet banking facility

105. detailed guidelines are being issued
separately.

102. with increasing expectation of
customers of ucbs for better products and
services on par with commercial banks,
the opening up of internet banking channel
to ucbs will enable them to retain their
customer base. it is, therefore, proposed:
•

to permit well managed and financially
sound ucbs to become members of the
negotiated dealing system (nds).

customer service
106. pursuant to the announcement made
in the monetary policy statement of april
2010, a committee on customer service
(chairman: shri m. damodaran) was
constituted to look into banking services
rendered to retail and small customers,
including pensioners. apart from formal
meetings, the committee members
have conducted meetings with various
stakeholders across the length and breadth
of the country. the report is in the process
of being finalised.

to permit scheduled ucbs satisfying
certain criteria to provide internet
banking facility to their customers.

103. detailed guidelines will be issued
separately.

review of november 2010, all licensed

v. regulatory and supervisory measures for commercial banks

banking sector

had issued certain enhancements to basel
ii framework, including amendments to the
market risk framework in july 2009, which
were implemented by the reserve bank with
effect from march 31, 2010. in december
2010, the bcbs released a comprehensive
package of further reforms which, together
with the july 2009 enhancements, is known
as the basel iii framework. this reform
package aims at (i) increasing the quality and

107. after the financial crisis, the bcbs
has taken a number of initiatives with a view
to improving the banking sector’s ability to
absorb shocks arising from financial and
economic stress and to reduce the risk of
spillover from the financial sector to the real
economy. it may be recalled that the bcbs

quantity of the capital with greater emphasis
on common equity; (ii) increasing the risk
coverage; (iii) introducing a leverage ratio
as a back stop to the risk-based capital ratio;
and (iv) introducing capital conservation
and counter-cyclical capital buffers to
ensure build up of additional capital in
good times, thereby protecting banks from
the dangers of excessive credit growth.
besides, the committee has also introduced
liquidity ratios with a view to ensuring that
banks maintain adequate liquidity buffers
and reduce maturity mismatches.

110.
in pursuance of the announcement
made in the second quarter review of
october 2009, banks were advised in
december 2009 to achieve a provisioning
coverage ratio (pcr) of 70 per cent
for their non-performing advances by
end-september 2010. this coverage ratio
was intended to achieve a counter-cyclical
objective by ensuring that banks build up
a good cushion of provisions to protect
them from any macroeconomic shock in
future. in april 2011, banks were advised
to segregate the surplus of provisions
under the pcr vis-a-vis as required as per
prudential norms as on september 30, 2010,
into an account styled as “counter-cyclical
buffer”. while the “counter-cyclical buffer”
so created would be available to banks for
making specific provisions during economic
downturns, there is a need for banks to
make higher specific provisions also as part
of the prudential provisioning framework.
accordingly, it is proposed to enhance
the provisioning requirements on certain
categories of non-performing advances and
restructured advances as under:

108. the reserve bank would adhere
to
internationally
agreed
phase-in
period (beginning january 1, 2013) for
implementation of the basel iii framework.
the reserve bank is studying the basel iii
reform measures for preparing appropriate
guidelines for implementation. it is taking
steps to disseminate information on basel
iii and help banks prepare for smooth
implementation of the framework.
implementation of advanced approaches
under basel ii framework
109. the reserve bank had announced
timeline for implementation of advanced
approaches for computation of regulatory
capital under the basel ii framework
in india in july 2009. the guidelines
for the standardised approach (tsa)/
alternate standardised approach (asa) for
operational risk were issued in march 2010
and those for internal models approach
(ima) for market risk in april 2010. draft
guidelines for advanced measurement
approach (ama) for operational risk were
issued in january 2011 for public comments/
feedback, and final guidelines were issued
in april 2011. guidelines for internal rating
based (irb) approach for credit risk are
under preparation.

•

advances classified as “sub-standard”
will attract a provision of 15 per cent
as against the existing 10 per cent
(the “unsecured exposures” classified
as sub-standard assets will attract an
additional provision of 10 per cent,
i.e., a total of 25 per cent as against the
existing 20 per cent);

•

the secured portion of advances which
have remained in “doubtful” category
up to one year will attract a provision
of 25 per cent (as against the existing
20 per cent);

•

the secured portion of advances which
have remained in “doubtful” category

for more than one year but upto 3 years
will attract a provision of 40 per cent (as
against the existing 30 per cent);
•

restructured accounts classified as
standard advances will attract a
provision of 2 per cent in the first
2 years from the date of restructuring,
or in cases of moratorium on payment
of interest/principal after restructuring,
for the period covering moratorium
and 2 years thereafter (as against
existing provision of 0.25-1.00
per cent, depending upon the category
of advances); and

•

restructured accounts classified as
non-performing
advances,
when
upgraded to standard category will
attract a provision of 2 per cent in the
first year from the date of upgradation
(as against existing provision of
0.25-1.00 per cent, depending upon the
category of advances).

thus, banks could potentially face a large
liquidity risk. it is, therefore, felt prudent to
place certain limits on banks’ investments
in domfs. accordingly, it is proposed:
•

that the investment in liquid
schemes of domfs by banks will
be subject to a prudential cap of
10 per cent of their net worth as on march
31 of the previous year. however, with
a view to ensuring a smooth transition,
banks which are already having
investments in domfs in excess of
the 10 per cent limit, will be allowed
to comply with this requirement in six
months’ time.

presence of foreign banks in india
113.
it was indicated in the monetary
policy statement of april 2010 that drawing
lessons from the crisis, a discussion paper
on the mode of presence of foreign banks
through branch or wholly owned subsidiary
(wos) would be prepared by september
2010. accordingly, a discussion paper on
presence of foreign banks in india was
placed on the reserve bank’s website in
january 2011 soliciting views/comments
from all stakeholders, including banks,
non-banking financial institutions, and
the public at large by march 7, 2011. the
comprehensive guidelines on the mode of
presence of foreign banks in india are being
formulated, keeping in view the suggestions/
comments on the discussion paper, received
from all concerned.

111.
detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued separately.
investments in debt oriented
mutual funds
112. it has been observed that banks’
investments in liquid schemes of debt
oriented mutual funds (domfs) have grown
manifold. the liquid schemes continue to
rely heavily on institutional investors such
as commercial banks whose redemption
requirements are likely to be large and
simultaneous. domfs, on the other hand,
are large lenders in the over-night markets
such as collateralised borrowing and lending
obligation (cblo) and market repo, where
banks are large borrowers. domfs invest
heavily in certificates of deposit (cds) of
banks. such circular flow of funds between
banks and domfs could lead to systemic
risk in times of stress/liquidity crunch.

licensing of new banks in the
private sector
114.
following the announcement made
by the hon’ble finance minister in the
union budget 2010-11 and as indicated in the
monetary policy statement of april 2010, the
reserve bank released a discussion paper
23

on licensing of new banks on its website
in august 2010, seeking views/comments
of banks, nbfcs, industrial houses, other
institutions, and the public at large. the
discussion paper reviewed the international
and indian experience on various issues and
also indicated possible approaches with the
pros and cons of each of the approaches.
detailed discussions were held with various
associations of stakeholders from the
industry, banks, nbfcs, and mfis and some
consultants in october, 2010. in addition,
diverse comments, including relating to
granting of banking license to industrial
houses/business houses have been received
from a large number of respondents, which
include parties interested in setting up
new banks, industry associations, banks,
academia, eminent personalities associated
with banking and finance, and the members
of the general public. certain issues, which
would require amendments to the banking
regulation act, 1949, have also been
brought to the notice of the government of
india. a gist of comments on various issues
received from important stakeholders and
eminent people on the discussion paper was
placed on the reserve bank’s website in
december 2010. all these comments have
been examined and the draft guidelines on
the entry of new banks are being finalised in
consultation with the government of india.

which would cover, among others, effective
governance of compensation, alignment of
compensation with prudent risk-taking and
disclosures for whole time directors/chief
executive officers as well as risk takers of
banks. accordingly, draft guidelines on
sound compensation policy were framed
and placed on the reserve bank’s website
in july 2010 for public comments. a large
number of comments/suggestions were
received on the draft guidelines and it was
proposed in the second quarter review
of monetary policy for 2010-11 to issue
final guidelines on compensation practices
by end-december 2010. however, in
october 2010, the bcbs brought out
a consultative paper titled ‘range of
methodologies for risk and performance
alignment of remuneration’, for public
comments. as the paper provides guidance
on important methodological issues, it has
been decided to await the final version of
this paper for formulating our guidelines.
accordingly, the implementation of the
reserve bank guidelines on compensation
policy has been deferred till 2012-13.
this will also give sufficient time to
banks to formulate their policies. banks,
in the meantime, should refer to the
bcbs consultative paper on ‘range of
methodologies for risk and performance
alignment of remuneration’ of october
2010, and begin the preparatory work.

compensation practices

convergence of indian accounting
standards with international financial
reporting standards

115. it was indicated in the second
quarter review of october 2009 that in
line with the steps taken by the global
community, particularly the initiatives taken
by g-20 nations, the reserve bank would
issue guidelines to private sector banks
and foreign banks with regard to sound
compensation policy. it was proposed to issue
comprehensive guidelines based on the fsb
principles on sound compensation practices,

116.
as indicated in the second quarter
review of november 2010, a working
group (chairman: shri p. r. ravi mohan)
was constituted in july 2010 to address
the implementation issues and facilitate
formulation of operational guidelines
in the context of convergence of indian
24

accounting standards with the international
financial reporting standards (ifrss). six
sub-groups, constituted under the aegis of
this working group, are closely monitoring
the developments at the international
level, especially the progress made by
the international accounting standard
board (iasb) in finalising the accounting
standards relating to financial instruments,
and fair value accounting, among others,
and attempting to prepare operational
guidelines within the framework of ifrs
for the indian banking sector. the ministry
of corporate affairs placed on its website
35 indian accounting standards (ind as),
converged with ifrs in february 2011. it
also stated that it would implement them
in a phased manner after various issues,
including tax related issues, were resolved
with the concerned departments. the
reserve bank is also endeavouring towards
skill development at the level of banks and
supervisors with a view to ensuring smooth
and non-disruptive migration to the ifrs.

of a depositor education and awareness
fund; facilitating consolidated supervision;
and a provision for supersession of boards
of directors by the reserve bank; and
increase in the quantum of penalties. the
proposals relating to the amendment of
the banking companies (acquisition &
transfer of undertakings) act, 1970 & 1980
include raising the authorised capital of
nationalised banks; enabling them to raise
capital through “rights issue” or by issue of
bonus shares; and raising the restrictions
on voting rights. these amendments will
have implications for the regulation and
supervision of various types of banks by the
reserve bank.
introduction of bank holding company/
financial holding company structure
in india
118.
in pursuance of the announcement
made in the monetary policy statement of
april 2010, a working group (chairperson:
smt. shyamala gopinath) was constituted
to examine the introduction of a holding
company structure for banks and other
financial entities together with the required
legislative and regulatory framework. the
group is expected to submit its report by
end-may 2011.

amendments to the banking
regulation act, 1949
117.
a comprehensive legislation for
the amendment of the banking regulation
act, 1949 and the banking companies
(acquisition & transfer of undertakings)
act, 1970 & 1980 was introduced in the
parliament in march 2011. the important
amendments relating to the banking
regulation act include insertion of a
new section to override the provisions of
the competition act, 2002 and exempt
the applicability of such provisions to
amalgamations/reconstitutions/mergers/
acquisitions, etc. of different categories of
banks; removal of the restrictions on voting
rights; enabling banking companies to issue
preference shares subject to regulatory
guidelines by the reserve bank; formation

information technology and related
issues: enhancement to the guidelines
119.
a working group on information
security, electronic banking technology
risk management and cyber frauds
(chairman: shri g. gopalakrishna) was
set up by the reserve bank to strengthen
the reserve bank’s guidelines relating to
the governance of it information security
measures, apart from enhancing independent
assurance about the effectiveness of it
controls. the report, which was submitted
by the group in january 2011, covers
25

various areas such as it governance,
information security (including electronic
banking channels like internet banking,
atms, cards), it operations, it services
outsourcing, information system audit,
cyber frauds, business continuity planning,
customer education and legal issues. the
report was placed on the reserve bank’s
website for public comments/feedback.
keeping in view the feedback/comments
received, detailed guidelines are being issued
to banks. while major recommendations
of the group are to be implemented by
banks within a period of six months, other
recommendations/guidelines are required
to be implemented within a period of one
year from the date of issue of the circular.

products, processes, strategies and risk
management techniques at the institutional
level. in the recent period, banks have
also emerged as financial conglomerates
in order to exploit economies of scale and
scope. in view of the widening gap between
growing supervisory responsibilities and
available supervisory resources, it was
considered expedient to conduct a review
of the supervisory processes followed
by the reserve bank. a high level
steering committee (chairman: dr. k. c.
chakrabarty) was set up by the reserve
bank to review the existing supervisory
processes in respect of commercial banks
in india. the committee, among others,
will include a leading industry expert,
one sitting and one retired chairman and
managing director (cmd) of public sector
banks as members. the committee will lay
down the terms of reference for review of the
supervisory processes in the reserve bank
and select one domestic or international
agency for reviewing the supervisory
processes and giving its recommendations
for implementation.

supervisory policies, procedures and
processes: a comprehensive review

significant changes with considerable
increase in size, number and complexities of
banks’ businesses over the last decade. there

a need was, therefore, felt to reflect on the
broad principles that underpin the regulatory
architecture for nbfcs, keeping in view the
economic role and heterogeneity of this sector
and the recent international experience. the
reserve bank has constituted a working
group (chairperson: smt. usha thorat) to
examine a range of emerging issues pertaining
to the regulation of the nbfc sector. the
group will also focus on the definition and
classification of nbfcs, keeping in view

imposed on such prepaid instruments.
considering the potential of such
mobile-based prepaid instruments for
promoting non-cash based transactions
and the interest evinced by non-bank
entities in promoting these products, it is
proposed:

setting up of central electronic registry
under the sarfaesi act, 2002
122. the government of india has set
up a company, incorporated under section
25 of the companies act, 1956, as the
central registry of securitisation asset
reconstruction and security interest of india
(cersai) to give effect to the provisions
of the securitisation and reconstruction
of financial assets and enforcement of
security interest (sarfaesi) act, 2002.
the objective of the central registry is
to prevent frauds in loan cases involving
multiple lending from different banks on
the same immovable property. the registry
became operational from march 2011 and
its jurisdiction covers the whole of india.

•

to treat mobile-based semi-closed
prepaid
instruments
issued
by
non-banks on par with other semiclosed payment instruments and raise
the limit from `5,000 to `50,000,
subject to certain conditions.

125. banks were permitted by the reserve
bank in december 2009 to provide their
customers the mobile-based transaction
facility up to `1,000 without end-to-end
encryption. taking into consideration the
feedback from banks for increasing the
limits for such transactions, it is proposed:
•

payment and settlement systems

to enhance the limit of such transactions
from `1,000 to `5,000.

working group for card present
transactions

mobile banking in india
123. considering
the
importance
of mobile phone channels for banking
services, the reserve bank issued
guidelines on mobile banking in october
2008. since then a number of relaxations
in the guidelines have been made. in all,
39 banks were granted approval for mobile
banking, of which 34 banks have launched
the mobile banking services. on an
average, 6,80,000 transactions amounting
to `61 crore in a month are settled through
this channel.

126. card
present
transactions
[transactions at points of sale (pos) and
atms] constitute a major proportion of
the card based transactions in the country.
for increasing the confidence of customers
in this channel, it is necessary to secure
these transactions through implementation
of additional security/authentication in
the short run and prevent counterfeiting
of cards by migrating to chip-based and
pin-based cards in the long run. considering
the importance of this process, a working
group comprising representatives from
various stakeholders was constituted
to recommend action plan for enabling
additional authentication for transactions
at pos using existing cards in a cost
effective manner and propose a timeframe

124. non-bank entities were permitted
by the reserve bank to issue mobilebased semi-closed prepaid instruments
in august 2009. to start with, these
instruments were considered as a separate

solutions to enhanced use of it in areas
such as management information system
(mis), regulatory reporting, overall
risk management, financial inclusion
and customer relationship management.
the recommendations related to both the
reserve bank and commercial banks. the
reserve bank has drawn a roadmap for
implementation of the vision document
over short-term (2 years), medium-term
(2-4 years) and long-term (4 years and
more). the reserve bank will, in
association with the indian banks’
association (iba), follow up on
implementation of the recommendations by
commercial banks.

performance of national electronic
funds transfer system
127. all the refinements to the national
electronic funds transfer (neft) have
been well accepted by the stakeholders
and the product is growing from strength
to strength in terms of acceptability, reach
and volumes handled. as at end-february
2011, around 75,000 branches of 100 banks
participated in the neft system and the
volume of transactions processed increased
to 13.5 million in february 2011. efforts
have also been initiated to extend neft
facility to the branches and customers of
rrbs. a few banks have since successfully
and seamlessly brought the rrbs
sponsored by them under the neft ambit.
further, full assistance was provided to
the royal monetary authority of bhutan;
the electronic clearing service (ecs) and
the neft were successfully replicated in
bhutan.

automated data flow from banks
129. a core group consisting of experts
from banks, the reserve bank, the institute
for development and research in banking
technology (idrbt) and the iba was
constituted for preparing an approach paper
on automated data flow (a straight through
process) from the core banking solution
(cbs) or other it systems of commercial
banks to the reserve bank. it was indicated
in the second quarter review of november
2010 that the core group had finalised
the approach paper and the timeline of
the entire project would be determined in
consultation with banks. it has been decided
to implement the project in a phased manner
taking into account the technology and
process maturity of individual banks. banks
have been advised to submit a roadmap
clearly indicating the returns which can be
sourced directly from the banks’ systems
for submission to the reserve bank without
manual intervention. it has also been
decided to prescribe a quarterly monitoring
format in which the banks will be advised
to certify the list of returns which have been

and expectations of the banking system in
general and those of the reserve bank, in
particular. the report of the committee
was placed on the reserve bank’s website
