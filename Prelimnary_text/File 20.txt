statement by dr. y. venugopal reddy,
governor, reserve bank of india on the
third quarter review of annual monetary policy
for the year 2006-07
this review consists of three sections: i. assessment of
macroeconomic and monetary developments; ii. stance of
monetary policy; and iii. monetary measures. an analytical profile
of macroeconomic and monetary developments was issued two
days in advance as a supplement to this review, providing the
necessary information and technical analysis with the help of
charts and tables.
i. assessment of macroeconomic and
monetary developments
domestic developments
2.
real gross domestic product (gdp) increased by
9.2 per cent in the second quarter (july-september) of 2006-07,
according to the end-november, 2006 release of the central
statistical organisation (cso), up from 8.9 per cent in the first
quarter and 8.4 per cent a year ago. accordingly, real gdp
growth firmed up to 9.1 per cent in the first half of 2006-07 from
8.5 per cent in the first half of 2005-06. real gdp originating in
agriculture, industry and services sectors rose by 2.6 per cent,
10.1 per cent and 10.6 per cent, respectively, during the first
half of 2006-07 as against 3.7 per cent, 7.9 per cent and
10.2 per cent a year ago.
3.
information that is available for the third quarter (octoberdecember) of 2006-07 suggests that the momentum of economic
activity has been sustained, but with some setbacks in the
1

agricultural sector. first estimates of the ministry of agriculture
place kharif foodgrains production at 105.2 million tonnes for the
current financial year – lower than 109.7 million tonnes in
2005-06 and also well below the target of 115.3 million tonnes.
favourable soil moisture conditions and normal reservoir levels
could, however, enable the recouping of kharif production losses
in the rabi output. rabi sowing acreage has increased by
3.4 per cent in the current season so far (i.e., up to january 5,
2007) from its level a year ago. increases have been recorded
in area sown under wheat (6.8 per cent), rice (8.1 per cent),
coarse cereals (6.4 per cent) and pulses (4.4 per cent) whereas
acreage under oilseeds declined by 8.7 per cent.
4.
industrial activity has picked up in an environment of
favourable demand conditions, strong corporate profitability and
overall business optimism. the index of industrial production
(iip) rose by 10.6 per cent during april-november 2006 as against
8.3 per cent a year ago. manufacturing contributed nearly
91.2 per cent of this growth, expanding by 11.5 per cent
(9.4 per cent a year ago). manufacturing activity was led by
basic metals and alloys, non-metallic mineral products, machinery
and transport equipment, basic chemicals and products and
cotton textiles. the strength of investment demand was reflected
in an increase of 16.1 per cent (16.2 per cent) in capital goods
production, supported by the growth in production of basic goods
by 9.3 per cent (6.1 per cent), in intermediate goods by
10.9 per cent (2.5 per cent) and in consumer durable goods by
12.5 per cent (14.2 per cent). in the consumer non-durables
segment, production rose by 8.7 per cent (12.9 per cent).
mining and electricity generation grew by 3.8 per cent
(0.5 per cent) and 7.3 per cent (5.0 per cent), respectively. the
six infrastructure industries, comprising 26.7 per cent of the iip,
2

posted a growth of 7.8 per cent during april-november, 2006 as
against 5.2 per cent a year ago. petroleum refinery products
and cement production registered double-digit growth, production
of crude petroleum recorded a turnaround and the growth of
electricity production was higher than a year ago. on the other
hand, the growth of coal and finished steel decelerated from the
pace of expansion last year.
5.
buoyant domestic and export demand conditions
continued to support private corporate sector performance. sales
of sampled non-financial private companies grew by 27.4
per cent in the first half of 2006-07, up from 17.2 per cent a year
ago. net profits increased by 41.6 per cent on top of a growth of
41.3 per cent in the first half of 2005-06. the gross profit margin
(gross profits to sales) at 15.6 per cent and the net profit margin
(profits after tax to sales) at 10.6 per cent were also at levels
higher than those in the corresponding period of the previous
year. early results for the third quarter of 2006-07 indicate
sustained growth in sales and in both gross and post-tax profits.
at the same time, there was some reduction in the growth of
interest burden, i.e., interest payments relative to gross profits in
comparison with previous quarters.
6.
the reserve bank’s industrial outlook survey points to
optimism on the growth outlook. the business expectations index
for october-december, 2006 was higher than in the preceding
quarter but marginally lower than in the corresponding quarter a
year ago. the expectations index for january-march, 2007 is
higher than in the preceding quarter as also in the corresponding
quarter a year ago. a positive outlook for demand conditions
continues with increased optimism reflected in order books,
production, employment and profit margins. the assessment
3

about growth of exports and imports indicates a marginally lower
level of confidence. expectations of increase in selling prices
have moderated somewhat in relation to the preceding quarter.
7.
business confidence polled by other surveys also appears
to have picked up in october-december, 2006 on the back of a
healthy increase in sales, profits, new orders, selling prices,
inventory levels and boosted by strong corporate results, record
number of mergers and acquisitions by indian companies and
rising equity prices. surveys of business expectations for januarymarch, 2007 indicate sustained optimism with regard to
investment climate, financial position of firms, sales volumes,
fuller capacity utilisation, new orders and profitability across the
goods and services sectors. selling prices are expected to
increase along with some increase in employee levels. seasonally
adjusted purchasing managers’ indices for december 2006
signalled the continuing improvements in business conditions in
the manufacturing sector, with expansion in production levels
boosted by higher volumes of new orders. on the other hand,
levels of unfinished business, average costs and output prices
appear to have risen in relation to the preceding month while
stronger demand and shortages of some raw materials have
placed pressure on suppliers.
8.
lead indicators of services sector activity suggest that
the robust growth recorded in 2005-06 was sustained in
2006-07 so far. railway revenue earnings from freight traffic
increased by 9.9 per cent in april-october 2006, while total cell
phone connections and net addition in switching capacity in the
telecommunication sector jumped by 121.9 per cent and 22.9
per cent, respectively. the import cargo handled by the civil
aviation sector and cargo handled by major ports increased by
4

19.3 per cent and 6.6 per cent, respectively, whereas passengers
handled at international and domestic terminals registered growth
of 11.9 per cent and 38.8 per cent, respectively.
9.
driven by the pick-up in real activity, credit extended by
scheduled commercial banks (scbs) increased by rs.2,50,402
crore (16.6 per cent) during the current financial year up to
january 5, 2007 as compared with the increase of rs.1,97,551
crore (17.1 per cent) in the corresponding period last year. the
increase of rs.2,392 crore in food credit was low and comparable
to the increase of rs.3,084 crore in the previous year. non-food
credit registered an increase of rs.2,48,010 crore
(16.9 per cent) as compared with an increase of rs.1,94,468
crore (17.5 per cent) in the corresponding period of 2005-06.
10.
on a year-on-year basis, non-food credit of scbs expanded
by rs.4,07,735 crore (31.2 per cent) as on january 5, 2007 on top
of an increase of rs.3,11,013 crore (31.2 per cent) a year ago.
provisional information available from select scbs for october 2006
indicates that credit to retail and services sectors increased by 33.4
per cent, constituting 49.2 per cent of total non-food bank credit
with the share of retail credit alone at 25.9 per cent. retail lending
rose by 34.3 per cent. within the retail sector, housing loans recorded
a growth of 32.3 per cent. loans to commercial real estate rose by
83.9 per cent with its share in total non-food bank credit at
2.5 per cent. on a year-on-year basis, credit to industry rose by
24.8 per cent by october 2006; however, industry’s share in total
non-food bank credit fell from 40.2 per cent in october 2005 to
38.7 per cent in october 2006. nevertheless, there was a pick-up
in credit flow to industries like infrastructure (23.2 per cent),
metals (34.6 per cent), textiles (34.2 per cent), chemicals
(26.9 per cent), petroleum (42.0 per cent), food processing
5

(23.6 per cent), construction (49.5 per cent), engineering
(15.3 per cent), gems and jewellery (21.7 per cent) and vehicles
(20.8 per cent). the share of infrastructure in total credit to
industry declined marginally from 20.2 per cent in october 2005
to 20.0 per cent in october 2006. bank credit to agriculture
(which has a share of 12.1 per cent in total bank credit) recorded
a growth of 30.8 per cent by october 2006. the share of priority
sector advances declined from 36.5 per cent to 35.2 per cent.
11.
banks’ investments in shares, bonds/debentures and
commercial paper increased by 0.6 per cent (rs.484 crore) during
the current financial year up to january 5, 2007 as against a
decline of 14.8 per cent (rs.13,794 crore) in the corresponding
period last year. scbs’ investments in mutual funds also
increased by rs.2,080 crore as against a decline of rs.6,051
crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. the total
flow of resources from scbs to the commercial sector increased
by 16.1 per cent (rs.2,48,494 crore) during the current financial
year so far as compared with the increase of 15.0 per cent
(rs.1,80,674 crore) in the corresponding period of the previous
year. the year-on-year growth in total resource flow was
29.5 per cent, over and above the growth of 27.7 per cent
a year ago.
12.
aggregate deposits of scbs increased by rs.2,72,194
crore (12.9 per cent) in the current financial year up to january
5, 2007 as compared with an increase of rs.1,58,070 crore
(8.9 per cent) in the corresponding period of the previous year.
on a year-on-year basis, the growth in aggregate deposits at
rs.4,38,037 crore (22.5 per cent) was higher than that of
rs.2,85,182 crore (17.2 per cent) a year ago and was also the
highest since 1993-94 on a comparable basis. there has also
6

been an expansion in term deposits, indicative of time preference
in response to rising interest rates. the incremental non-food
credit-deposit ratio has declined to 91.1 per cent from
123.0 per cent a year ago.
13.
commercial banks’ investment in government and other
approved securities at rs.48,331 crore during the current financial
year up to january 5, 2007 was substantially higher than the
decline of rs.17,559 crore in the corresponding period of the
previous year. banks’ holdings of government and other approved
securities fell to 28.6 per cent of their net demand and time
liabilities (ndtl) as on january 5, 2007 from 32.6 per cent a year
ago. the stock of securities with banks in excess of the minimum
statutory liquidity ratio (slr) requirement amounted to rs.96,407
crore on january 5, 2007. adjusted for banks’ repo/reverse repo
with the reserve bank under the liquidity adjustment facility (laf),
their investment in securities increased by rs.50,396 crore during
2006-07 so far as against a decline of rs.1,519 crore a year ago.
excess slr investment, adjusted for laf holdings, was higher at
rs.91,222 crore or 3.4 per cent of ndtl.
14.
on a year-on-year basis, the growth in money supply
(m3) at 20.4 per cent on january 5, 2007 was higher than
16.0 per cent a year ago and above the projected trajectory of
15.0 per cent indicated in the annual policy statement for
2006-07. during the current financial year so far, m3 increased
by rs.3,24,624 crore (11.9 per cent) which was higher than the
increase of rs.2,04,175 crore (8.8 per cent) in the corresponding
period of the previous year.
15.
the year-on-year increase in reserve money was
20.0 per cent as on january 19, 2007 as compared with
7

14.9 per cent a year ago. on a financial year basis, reserve
money increased by rs.68,724 crore (12.0 per cent) up to
january 19, 2007 as compared with the increase of rs.45,809
crore (9.4 per cent) in the corresponding period of the previous
year. while currency in circulation increased by rs.57,575 crore
(13.4 per cent) as compared with rs.48,574 crore (13.2
per cent), bankers’ deposits with the reserve bank registered a
growth of rs.12,319 crore (9.1 per cent) due to the increase in
the cash reserve ratio (crr) as compared with a decline of
rs.870 crore (0.8 per cent). among the sources of reserve
money, net reserve bank’s credit to the central government
increased by rs.6,963 crore as compared with the increase of
rs.50,622 crore in the corresponding period last year. adjusted
for transactions under the laf, net reserve bank’s credit to the
central government showed a decline of rs.12,097 crore, mainly
reflecting the changes in balances under the market stabilisation
scheme (mss) and the centre’s cash balances. the reserve
bank’s net foreign exchange assets (nfea) increased by
rs.1,14,337 crore as against an increase of rs.2,043 crore during
the corresponding period of the previous year. the reserve
bank’s foreign currency assets, adjusted for revaluation,
increased by rs.80,166 crore as compared with an increase of
rs.11,185 crore (inclusive of sales towards imd redemption)
during the corresponding period of the previous year. the ratio
of nfea to currency increased from 156.3 per cent on march 31,
2006 to 161.3 per cent by january 19, 2007.
16.
average daily net absorption under the laf which was
rs.36,857 crore in july-september, 2006 moderated to rs.12,262
crore in october, 2006. the reserve bank injected liquidity
through laf repos during october 20-25, 2006; however, some
reverse repo bids were also received during this period, indicating
8

that the distribution of liquidity in the system was skewed. liquidity
conditions balanced in subsequent weeks with the laf returning
to absorption mode. reverse repo under the laf came down to
rs.9,937 crore in november and net absorptions continued until
december 12, 2006. injections under the laf resumed from
december 13, 2006 as liquidity tightened with outflows from the
banking system on account of advance tax payments as well as
the 25 basis points increase in the crr which became effective
from december 23, 2006. average daily liquidity injection under
the laf amounted to rs.16,768 crore during december 13-31,
2006 as against average daily liquidity absorption of rs.22,125
crore during december 1-12, 2006. in january so far (up to
january 25, 2007), with the second round of 25 basis points
increase in the crr coming into effect from january 6, 2007
there was net average daily injection of liquidity of rs.11,034
crore. additional liquidity amounting to rs.13,040 crore was
absorbed under the mss during 2006-07 up to
january 25, 2007. the balances under the mss increased from
rs.29,000 crore on march 31, 2006 to rs.42,040 crore by
january 25, 2007. in several auctions of treasury bills and
dated securities under the mss, there was partial acceptance of
the notified amounts. the central government’s cash balances
with the reserve bank increased from an average daily level of
rs.9,569 crore in april-june 2006 to rs.16,029 crore in
july-september, 2006, rs.36,769 crore in october-december
and rs.49,156 crore in january 2007 (up to january 25). the
average liquidity overhang as reflected in outstandings under
the laf, mss and surplus cash balances of the central
government taken together, which was rs.89,786 crore in
april-june, 2006 and rs.92,354 crore in july-september, 2006
declined to rs.84,312 crore in october-december, 2006 and
further declined to rs.78,800 crore in january (up to january
25, 2007).
9

17.
inflation, measured by variations in the wholesale price
index (wpi) on a year-on-year basis, increased from its
end-march 2006 level of 4.1 per cent to 5.4 per cent at
end-october, 2006 and increased to the intra-year peak of
6.1 per cent on january 6, 2007 before marginally declining to
6.0 per cent by january 13, 2007. on an average basis, annual
inflation based on the wpi, which was at 4.6 per cent at
end-october 2006, increased to 4.9 per cent by january 13,
2007 as compared with 4.7 per cent a year ago.
18.
at a disaggregated level, prices of primary articles (weight:
22.0 per cent in the wpi basket) registered a year-on-year
increase of 9.3 per cent as on january 13, 2007 as compared
with an increase of 5.6 per cent a year ago. the rise in prices of
primary articles was under food as well as non-food items. prices
of manufactured products (weight: 63.8 per cent) was steadily
driven up by rising domestic demand and the return of pricing
power to corporates. manufacturing inflation increased to
5.6 per cent by january 13, 2007 from 1.9 per cent at the
beginning of the current financial year and 2.2 per cent a year
ago, led by prices of paper, non-metallic mineral products, food
products, rubber and plastic products. there was deceleration/
decline in the prices of wood and leather products, chemicals,
basic metals and alloys, machinery and transport equipment.
within the category of manufactured products, prices of cement
have risen by 17.9 per cent (12.9 per cent a year ago),
contributing 4.5 per cent of the headline wpi inflation. prices of
capital goods have been rising, coincident with high growth in
production and imports, and are indicative of rising investment
demand. among capital goods, prices of electrical machinery
rose by 11.3 per cent (1.9 per cent a year ago) with a contribution
of 5.8 per cent to overall inflation.
10

19.
the average price of the ‘indian basket’ of international
crude which was us $ 67.3 per barrel in april-june, 2006 and
us $ 67.9 per barrel during july-september, 2006 declined to a
low of us $ 57.6 per barrel in october 2006 before firming up to
us $ 58.4 per barrel and us $ 60.0 per barrel in november
and december 2006, respectively. thereafter, it reduced to
us $ 51.0 per barrel by january 25, 2007. the annual increase
in prices of the ‘fuel, power, light and lubricants’ group (weight:
14.2 per cent) at 3.7 per cent as on january 13, 2007 was lower
than 7.9 per cent a year ago and reflected the impact of reduction
in prices of petrol and diesel at end-november 2006. excluding
the fuel group, inflation was at 6.6 per cent (2.5 per cent a year
ago), which was higher than the headline.
20.
inflation based on the consumer price index (cpi) for
urban non-manual employees, agricultural labourers and rural
labourers showed a sharp year-on-year increase to 6.9 per cent,
8.9 per cent and 8.3 per cent in december 2006, respectively,
from 5.7 per cent, 4.7 per cent and 4.9 per cent, a year ago.
the year-on-year cpi inflation for industrial workers was also
placed higher at 6.3 per cent in november 2006 than 5.3 per
cent a year ago. on an annual average basis, cpi for industrial
workers registered a year-on-year increase of 6.0 per cent in
november 2006 as against 4.1 per cent a year ago. elevated
prices of food articles, which have a higher weightage in the cpi
basket relative to the wpi, is a significant factor in the divergence
between consumer prices and wholesale prices.
21.
revenue receipts of the union government as a proportion
to the budget estimates (be) improved to 54.8 per cent in
april-november, 2006 from 49.5 per cent in april-november 2005.
revenue expenditure at 62.6 per cent of the be was, however,
11

higher than 58.4 per cent a year ago mainly on account of a
substantial increase in non-plan revenue expenditure.
accordingly, the revenue deficit increased to 99.7 per cent
of be during april-november, 2006 as compared with
91.5 per cent in the corresponding period last year. the gross
fiscal deficit as a proportion to the be, however, decreased to
72.8 per cent from 74.7 per cent a year ago due to cutbacks in
non-defence capital outlay.
22.
the gross borrowings of the central government at
rs.1,25,000 crore (rs.1,15,000 crore a year ago) through dated
securities during 2006-07 so far (up to january 22, 2007)
constituted 83.1 per cent of the be, while net market borrowings
at rs.91,432 crore (rs.83,079 crore a year ago) constituted
80.4 per cent of the be. the weighted average yield and weighted
average maturity of the central government securities issued
during 2006-07 so far were 7.86 per cent and 14.56 years, as
compared with 7.34 per cent and 16.90 years, respectively, for
those issued during 2005-06. all issuances during the current
financial year, except three, were reissuances reflecting efforts
towards consolidation of public debt and imparting liquidity to
the government securities market. as against the provisional
net allocation of rs.17,242 crore (gross: rs.25,860 crore) for
their market borrowing programme, the state governments have
raised a net amount of rs.7,668 crore (gross: rs.14,204 crore)
up to january 25, 2007.
23.
stable and orderly conditions in financial markets were
interrupted by short episodes of volatility in the first half of
november and the second half of december with interest rates
firming up in almost all segments. tightness in liquidity due to
advance tax outflows, which had pushed up call rates above the
12

laf repo rate in the second half of september, resurfaced during
october in the run up to the announcement of the mid-term
review. in the second half of november, stability returned and
call rates fell back to within the laf corridor. reduction in liquidity
with the banking system on account of sustained credit demand,
sizeable tax outflows and build-up of the centre’s cash balances
led to a sharp drop in the daily volumes of funds offered at the
laf auctions and a rise in overnight rates after december 13,
2006. call rates touched a level of 16.9 per cent on december
29 – the highest since june, 2000. in subsequent weeks, while
call rates have come off these levels, they remain above the
laf corridor. interest rates in the call, market repo and
collateralised borrowing and lending obligations (cblo) segments
of the money market averaged 8.28 per cent, 7.34 per cent and
7.10 per cent in january 2007 (up to january 25, 2007)
respectively, up from 6.75 per cent, 6.44 per cent and 6.29
per cent in october 2006.
24.
the primary yields on 91-day treasury bills increased to
7.39 per cent on january 24, 2007 from 5.41 per cent at
end-april, 2006 and 6.65 per cent in end-october 2006. yields
on 364-day treasury bills increased to 7.27 per cent on january
17, 2007 from 5.90 per cent at end-april, 2006 and 6.99
per cent in end-october 2006. the outstanding amount of cp
was rs.23,663 crore by mid-january 2007 as compared with
rs.12,718 crore at end-march, 2006. the weighted average
discount rate (wadr) on cp increased to 8.70 per cent from
8.59 per cent over this period. in the market for certificates of
deposit (cds), wadr declined from 8.62 per cent at the end of
march, 2006 to 8.28 per cent by december 22, 2006
accompanied by 57.5 per cent increase in the outstanding amount
(i.e., from rs.43,568 crore to rs.68,619 crore).
13

25.
in the foreign exchange market, there was an increase in
activity in both the spot and the forward segments during the
third quarter of 2006-07. the average daily turnover in the
inter-bank segment increased from us $ 16.08 billion during the
quarter ended september, 2006 to us $ 19.75 billion during the
quarter ended december, 2006. the average daily turnover in
the merchant segment also increased from us $ 6.20 billion to
us $ 7.78 billion during the period. the ratio of inter-bank to
merchant turnover was 2.54 during the quarter ended december,
2006 as against 2.59 in the previous quarter. six-month forward
premia increased from 2.11 per cent in end-october, 2006 to
3.98 per cent by january 25, 2007.
26.
the yield on government securities with one-year residual
maturity moved up from 6.22 per cent at end-april, 2006
to 7.30 per cent as on january 25, 2007. the yield on
government securities with 10-year residual maturity also firmed
up from 7.40 per cent at end-april, 2006 to 7.89 per cent
as on january 25, 2007. the yield on government securities
with 20-year residual maturity increased from 7.80 per cent to
8.16 per cent during the same period. the yield spread between
10-year and one-year government securities narrowed down
from 118 basis points to 59 basis points as on january 25,
2007. the yield spread between 20-year and one-year
government securities narrowed down from 158 basis points to
86 basis points.
27.
deposit rates offered by scbs on various maturities have
generally been revised upwards during the current financial year.
deposit rates, which had increased by 25-175 basis points in
october over april 2006, particularly for the longer end, rose
further by 25-50 basis points in december over october 2006,
14

and by 25-125 basis points in january 2007 across various
maturities. in addition, higher interest rates have been offered
on special deposit schemes of specified maturities in terms of
number of days, with attractive features such as put options for
depositors and in schemes specifically meant for senior citizens.
in january 2007, some private sector banks raised deposit rates
on specific maturity brackets by over 200 basis points, reflecting
aggressive pricing strategies in the wake of continuing high credit
growth, but also indicative of growing mismatches in their
asset-liability positions.
28.
on the lending side, most scbs increased their lending
rates (bplrs) by 75-150 basis points between april, 2006 january, 2007. the bplrs of public sector banks (psbs) and
private sector banks increased to a range of 11.50-12.25 per cent
and 11.75-15.50 per cent from 10.25-11.25 per cent and
11.00-14.00 per cent, respectively, during the same period. the
weighted average bplr of psbs increased from 10.71 per cent
in march, 2006 to 11.18 per cent in june, 2006 and further to
11.58 per cent in december, 2006. the weighted average bplrs
of private sector banks also increased from 12.37 per cent in
march, 2006 to 12.80 per cent in june, 2006 and 13.22 per cent
in december, 2006. the weighted average bplrs of foreign
banks increased from 12.67 per cent to 12.72 per cent during
the same period.
29.
during the current year so far, equity market activity
recorded a significant increase in terms of issuances in the
domestic primary segment as well as in international stock
exchanges. the bse sensex (1978-79 = 100) which had risen
from 11,280 in end-march, 2006 to 12,612 on may 10, 2006
before receding to 8,929 on june 14, 2006 was supported in
15

subsequent months by robust macroeconomic fundamentals and
high private corporate profitability. the sensex rallied with
intermittent corrections to reach a high of 14,283 on january 25, 2007.
developments in the external sector
30.
balance of payments data for the second quarter of
2006-07 released at the end of december 2006 indicate
underlying shifts in the external sector of the economy.
merchandise export growth in us dollar terms decelerated
to 22.9 per cent in april-september 2006 from 34.2 per cent in
the first half of 2005-06, mainly in some segments such
as chemicals and related products, textile and related products,
leather and manufactures and a decline in exports of handicrafts
and gems and jewellery. merchandise import growth also
decelerated to 25.3 per cent from 48.2 per cent a year ago,
mainly due to lower growth of non-oil imports at 11.5 per cent
as against 47.9 per cent a year ago. the merchandise trade
deficit increased to us $ 35.1 billion during april-september,
2006 from us $ 27.1 billion in the first half of 2005-06. buoyant
exports of software, transportation services, the continuing
strength of remittances from indians working overseas and the
growing net exports of various professional and business services
resulted in an increase of us $ 23.5 billion in net invisible earnings
from us $ 19.9 billion a year ago. the increase in invisible
payments by 39.8 per cent, in conjunction with the
wider trade deficit, resulted in a current account deficit (cad)
of us $ 11.7 billion which was higher than the cad of us $ 7.2
billion a year ago.
31.
net capital inflows during april-september, 2006 at
us $ 19.3 billion were composed of both debt and non-debt
16

inflows. while portfolio investment slowed down markedly from
us $ 5.4 billion in april-september, 2005 to us $ 1.6 billion
mainly due to stock market turbulence in may-june, 2006 foreign
direct investment (fdi) doubled to us $ 4.2 billion from us $
2.1 billion. debt flows (net) in the form of external assistance,
external commercial borrowings (ecbs), non-resident indian
(nri) deposits and short-term credit put together increased
substantially to us $ 9.4 billion in april-september, 2006 from
us $ 4.5 billion a year ago.
32.
net accretion to foreign exchange reserves, excluding
valuation changes, amounted to us $ 8.6 billion during
april-september, 2006. valuation gains, reflecting the
appreciation of major currencies against the us dollar, accounted
for a rise of us $ 5.1 billion in total reserves as against a
valuation loss of us $ 5.0 billion in the corresponding period last
year. the foreign exchange reserves, including valuation
changes, thus recorded an increase of us $ 13.7 billion during
this period as against a modest increase of us $ 1.5 billion a
year ago.
33.
according to the provisional data released by the
directorate general of commercial intelligence and statistics
(dgci&s), exports recorded a growth of 22.0 per cent during
april-december 2006 as compared with 29.9 per cent in the
corresponding period of 2005. exports of petroleum, oil and
lubricants (pol) increased by 64.6 per cent to us $ 8.2 billion.
imports rose by 24.8 per cent during april-december 2006 as
compared with 37.8 per cent a year ago. while pol imports
rose by 39.2 per cent during april-december, 2006 (46.9
per cent a year ago), non-oil import growth decelerated
to 18.7 per cent during april-december 2006 from 34.3 per cent
17

a year ago. imports of gold and silver, which declined by
3.6 per cent during april-september, 2006 against an increase
of 58.5 per cent a year ago, picked up substantially in october
and november, according to information received from authorised
banks. among other non-oil imports, pearls, precious and
semi-precious stones declined by 32.8 per cent as against
an increase of 37.5 per cent a year ago. on the other hand,
non-oil non-bullion imports decelerated to 19.2 per cent from
47.0 per cent in april-september, 2006. imports of capital goods
maintained strong growth (38.8 per cent during april-september
2006 as compared with 47.8 per cent a year ago) in consonance
with the sustained investment demand in the economy. reflecting
the higher order of expansion in imports, the trade deficit, based
on dgci&s data, increased from us $ 31.7 billion during
april-december 2005 to us $ 41.6 billion during april-december,
2006.
34.
capital flows to india remained sizeable during 2006-07
so far, taking the form of foreign direct investment (fdi), capital
issues under amercian depository receipts (adrs)/global
depository receipts (gdrs) and net accretions to nri deposits.
fdi inflows at us $ 8.6 billion during april-november 2006 were
higher by 91.7 per cent than in the corresponding period of the
previous year. source-wise, mauritius, the us and singapore
remain the dominant sources of fdi to india. foreign institutional
investors (fiis) were net sellers during may-july 2006 against
the backdrop of weakness in domestic equity markets in
consonance with the trends in international markets. during
august-november, 2006 fiis made large purchases in the indian
stock markets. since december 2006, however, fiis registered
outflows against the backdrop of volatility in asian equity markets
subsequent to the tightening of capital controls by thailand. the
18

net cumulative fii inflows during 2006-07 so far (up to january
19, 2007) amounted to us $ 2.4 billion as against us $ 5.7
billion during the corresponding period last year. amounts
mobilised by corporates through adrs/gdrs were also higher
during april-november 2006. nri deposits recorded inflows of
the order of us $ 2.7 billion during april-november 2006 as
compared with inflows of us $ 0.5 billion registered during the
corresponding period of 2005, partly reflecting higher interest
rates offered by banks on such deposits. the foreign exchange
reserves rose to us $ 178.1 billion by january 19, 2007 from
us $ 151.6 billion at the end of march, 2006.
35.
the indian foreign exchange market has generally
witnessed orderly conditions during the current financial year so
far with the exchange rate exhibiting two-way movements. the
exchange rate of the rupee against the us dollar, which was
rs.44.61 at end-march, 2006 depreciated to rs.46.95 by
july 19, 2006 but appreciated thereafter to rs.44.24 by
january 25, 2007. similarly, the rupee-euro exchange rate
depreciated from rs.54.20 at end-march, 2006 to rs.59.90 by
august 22, 2006 before appreciating to rs.57.33 by january 25,
2007. overall, the rupee appreciated by 0.8 per cent against the
us dollar, and by 3.4 per cent against the japanese yen but
depreciated against the euro by 5.5 per cent and against the
pound sterling by 10.5 per cent during the current financial year
so far (up to january 25, 2007).
36.
the exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided
by the broad principles of careful monitoring and management
of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or a
pre-announced target or a band, coupled with the ability to
intervene, if and when necessary. the overall approach to the
19

management of india’s foreign exchange reserves takes into
account the changing composition of the balance of payments
and endeavours to reflect the ‘liquidity risks’ associated with
different types of flows and other requirements.
developments in the global economy
37.
the international monetary fund (imf) has projected in
its world economic outlook of september 2006 that global real
gdp growth on a purchasing power parity basis is expected to
accelerate to 5.1 per cent in 2006 from 4.9 per cent in 2005 but
will slow down to 4.9 per cent again in 2007. world real gdp
growth, on the basis of market exchange rates, is estimated to
accelerate to 3.8 per cent in 2006 from 3.4 per cent in 2005
before easing back to 3.5 per cent in 2007.
38.
in the us, real gdp growth was 2.0 per cent in the third
quarter (july-september) as compared with 5.6 per cent and
2.6 per cent in the first and second quarters, respectively. the
slowdown was mainly on account of lower residential fixed
investment and higher imports. in the third quarter of 2006, the
us current account deficit stood at 6.8 per cent of gdp. recent
indicators such as stronger employment in december and higher
producer price indices reflect some support for growth in the
fourth quarter. the year 2006 recorded the largest rate of decline
in new home sales since 1990 and the inventory of completedbut-unsold homes rose to a record level. euro area gdp growth
decelerated to 0.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2006 from the
second quarter growth of 1 per cent, though the year-on-year
growth rate remained on the projected trajectory of 2.7 per cent.
the european central bank (ecb) has estimated euro area
gdp growth to be between 2.5 per cent and 2.9 per cent in
20

2006 and between 1.7 per cent and 2.7 per cent in 2007. activity
has been strong in 2006, consumer and business confidence
have risen, business investment has picked up and
unemployment has fallen below 8 per cent for the first time
since 2001. buoyant household consumption has imparted further
strength to the recovery. in germany, marked buoyancy in
economic activity has emanated from business confidence and
exports. the weaker pace of expansion (0.8 per cent) in the
recovering japanese economy in the third quarter was due to
downward revisions in consumer spending and capital
investment. the outlook for the fourth quarter is, however, more
positive on anticipated business plans to boost spending. japan’s
corporate sector activity has firmed in recent months as indicated
by industrial production and machinery orders, and the household
sector is recovering from the softness witnessed in mid-2006.
39.
in the developing world, growth has picked up in asia
and other emerging markets, including latin america and russia,
on account of favourable international financial conditions, strong
commodity prices and abundant global liquidity. growth held up
well in most of asia in the third quarter of 2006 despite a
slowdown in us demand and, notwithstanding some
uncertainties, growth forecasts for 2007 have been revised
upward. inflation risks remain moderate in the region, helped by
the recent fall in global crude prices.
40.
rapid growth was experienced in china which expanded
by 10.7 per cent in 2006, marking the fastest growth since 1995
and the fourth consecutive year of growth of at least 10 per
cent. inflation for 2006 was at 2.8 per cent. there are concerns
that such high levels of growth might be unsustainable and that
some parts of the economy are becoming overheated. hence,
21

the government and the people’s bank of china have taken a
series of measures in a bid to slow down growth to more
sustainable levels and reduce potential inflationary pressures in
sensitive sectors. these measures are expected to help in
containing the growth in money supply and credit in the chinese
economy and lessen the possibilities of overheating in 2007.
41.
china’s foreign exchange reserves have crossed
us $ one trillion in 2006 and china plans to ease the rules for
capital outflows in 2007 while restricting inflows, together with
actively exploring alternative channels to invest the reserves. a
substantial amount of the liquidity emanating from china’s trade
surplus has flowed into its stock markets and the total assets
held in domestic equity funds accounted for about 10 per cent of
china’s total equity market capitalisation. to rein in potential
stock market overheating, measures have been taken to slow
the large inflow of investments into the domestic share markets.
china continues to maintain controls on portfolio equity flows in
both directions. in january, 2007 the securities regulators have
delayed approval for launch of new money market funds.
42.
the korean economy is expected to grow by 4.4 per cent
in 2007, slower than 5.0 per cent in 2006. in korea, consumer
price inflation has decelerated over 2006. there are, however,
concerns about a relatively rapid growth in house prices along
with a rise in household indebtedness. in response, the bank of
korea (bok) has raised its policy rate, increased reserve
requirements and has cut the ceiling on aggregate loans to
commercial banks by 20 per cent for lending to small and medium
enterprises in december. the bok announced an increase in its
foreign currency lending to banks so that they could increase
their investment in overseas securities.
22

43.
in thailand, headline inflation had been gradually easing
during 2006 in response to policy rate increases in january,
march, april and june. following an increase in headline inflation
in november (3.5 per cent), however, the bank of thailand
introduced controls on short-term capital inflows on december
18, 2006. this was preceded by a series of steps to stem strong
capital inflows into the economy over the past few months,
including a minimum three-month holding period for foreign
investors for their investment in government or central bank
paper; banning onshore banks from conducting sell-buy swap
operations with non-residents who were using this method to
increase their long baht positions; and seeking co-operation from
the thai business entities not to issue or sell short-term securities
to non-residents.
44.
malaysia recorded a growth rate of 5.8 per cent in the
third quarter of 2006 and is expected to grow by 5.3 per cent in
2007. malaysia’s growth is largely export-oriented. exports
recorded a decline in october, 2006 in tandem with the slowdown
in export growth in other asian economies. inflation has not
been a serious concern in malaysia during the last two years
and has come down by 0.4 percentage point over 2006.
45.
in 2006, there has been a surge in the international prices
of cereals, in particular, wheat and maize. poor harvests in key
producing countries due to reasons such as drought conditions
in australia, the expectation of a decline in carry-over stocks in
exporting countries, and fast growing demand for bio-fuel
production have been the main constraints on grain markets.
the decline in production of wheat in 2006 has turned out to be
the largest since 1996 with concomitant sharp increases in prices.
world trade in wheat in 2006-07 is, however, likely to remain at
23

the high levels recorded in the previous year, mainly due to
larger imports by brazil and india. the steep rise in ocean freight
rates has also contributed to the increase in the food import bills
of developing countries. supply constraints have also dominated
the rice economy. after three years of deficit, global sugar
production is expected to outpace demand in 2006, although
the sugar market remains particularly susceptible to large demand
swings and price volatility. futures prices of foodgrains have
climbed to record levels due to substantial reductions in crop
production estimates. wheat futures had risen to a 10-year high
on october 17, 2006. corn prices have surged to a 10-year high
on january 16, 2007 in the us after the government predicted
the smallest global supply in 29 years. these record prices are
spilling over into wheat, soyabean and other agricultural
commodities being traded on the futures market, except for sugar.
wheat futures are driven by concerns that us growers will switch
from wheat to corn because of the improved outlook coupled
with demand from the us ethanol industry, even as wheat stocks
remain around 10-year lows.
46.
metal prices have risen by 53.6 per cent in 2006, over
and above the increase of 36.2 per cent in 2005. low stock
levels and continuing demand has kept most metal prices high
and elevated levels are likely to persist in the near term. gold
prices, which had sharply risen to its highest level in 26 years in
may 2006, have eased recently due to the strengthening of the
us dollar.
47.
spot crude oil prices softened from the july-august peak
of us $ 78 per barrel to around us $ 53 per barrel in january
due to unusually warm weather and change in funds flow to the
oil sector, despite production cuts by the organization of
24

petroleum exporting countries (opec) since december.
in january 2007, the international energy agency has projected
that demand growth in 2007 might slow down owing to uncertainty
about the course of the us economy, fuel switching and lower
demand in the former soviet union countries. in the futures
market, the west texas intermediate (wti) crude oil is currently
being priced at us$ 57.59 per barrel six months hence.
48.
in the us, consumer prices declined from 3.8 per cent in
august to 2.0 per cent in november, 2006 but accelerated to
2.5 per cent in december. in the euro area, inflation declined
from 2.3 per cent during august to 1.9 per cent in december.
inflation decelerated in japan, i.e., to 0.3 per cent in december
from 0.9 per cent in august. in the uk, inflation has been
exceeding the target of 2.0 per cent since may and
stood at 3.0 per cent in december, the highest in a decade. the
retail rpi inflation rose to 4.4 per cent in the uk in december,
2006 - the highest since 1991.
49.
the slowdown in headline inflation in september-october
in the us was not matched by similar declines in core inflation,
indicating that underlying inflationary pressures persist. core
inflation in december was 2.6 per cent as against 2.7 per cent
in october. in the uk, core inflation has been increasing in
tandem with the headline rate and stood at 1.8 per cent in
december, up from 1.6 per cent in november. in the euro area,
both headline and core inflation have stabilised with the latter at
1.5 per cent over the third quarter. core inflation in japan has
declined by 0.3 per cent in december as compared with the
decline of 0.2 per cent in november. globally, headline inflation
has been moderating mainly on account of the decline in
international crude prices, while core inflation has generally
25

remained firm and is likely to shape inflation expectations which
can get exacerbated if international crude prices start rising again
and current pressures are allowed to continue.
50.
the dow jones industrial average rose to an all-time
intraday high on january 24, 2007. markets have also been
boosted by a number of company-specific events, including
merger and acquisition announcements which reached record
levels in 2006. balance sheets of corporations and financial
institutions have strengthened significantly, with many
accumulating substantial liquid assets, and bankruptcy rates
remained near record low levels worldwide. the us yield curve
inverted with 10-year bond yields at 4.88 per cent between endoctober and january 26, 2007 albeit with intermittent variations.
the 10-year bond yields in the euro area have increased from
4.0 per cent at end-october to 4.09 per cent. the japanese
10-year bond yield has declined from 1.71 per cent at
end-october to 1.68 per cent. on a trade-weighted basis, the
us dollar which had depreciated during october-december, has
appreciated marginally in january 2007. the us dollar rose to a
seven-week high against major currencies on january 9, 2007
following concerns expressed by fed officials about inflation.
in credit markets, spreads on credit default swaps (cdss), which
had widened in may-june, has tightened.
51.
the us current account deficit is projected by the oecd
to reach 6.5 per cent of gdp in 2007 with substantial surpluses
elsewhere, particularly in asia. there has been a sharp expansion
in long-term cdss, reflecting increasing liquidity at the longer
end of the maturity spectrum. growth in lending to emerging
asian economies expanded, mainly to china and korea. the
us dollar remains the largest single currency of debt issuance
26

for emerging market economies. the proportion of us dollars
held in banks outside the us is 30–50 percentage points higher
than the corresponding ratios for the euro or the japanese yen,
reflecting the continuing importance of the us dollar as an
international currency. by and large, monetary policy authorities
are inclined to continue to regard inflation as a major global risk
and are vigilant about threats to inflation expectations. they are
also watchful about the emergence of excessive volatility and
disorderly conditions in currency markets. they have generally
displayed a preparedness to act pre-emptively against the
possibility of these risks materialising.
52.
some central banks have paused in their policy
cycles, particularly the us. the pause of the federal reserve
during august-december came after seventeen increases by
25 basis points each between june 2004 and june 2006.
other central banks that have kept their policy rates steady
include the bank of canada at 4.25 per cent since may, 2006);
the bank of japan (uncollateralised overnight rate target at
0.25 per cent since july, 2006 after maintaining a zero interest
rate policy since september 2001); bank negara malaysia
(overnight policy rate at 3.5 per cent since april 2006); and
the banco de mexico (benchmark overnight lending rate at
7.0 per cent since april, 2006).
53.
some other central banks have cut back their policy rates
in recent months. these include bank indonesia (bi) (bi rate
reduced from 12.50 per cent in may, 2006 to 9.50 per cent in
january, 2007); the banco central do brasil (selic rate target
cut between september 2005 and january 2007 to 13.0 per cent);
the banco central de chile (benchmark lending rate reduced to
5.00 per cent in january 2007 from 5.25 per cent in july 2006)
27

and the bank of thailand (1-day repurchase rate reduced from
4.94 per cent to 4.75 per cent in january, 2007).
54.
the central banks that have tightened their policy rates
include the ecb which has raised its policy rates six times since
december, 2005 by 25 basis points each to 3.50 per cent (main
refinancing rate); the bank of england (repo rate raised in august
and november, 2006 and january, 2007 by 25 basis points to
5.25 per cent), the reserve bank of australia (cash rate raised
by 25 basis points each in august and november 2006 to
6.25 per cent); the people’s bank of china (lending rate raised
twice to 6.12 per cent by august 18, 2006); and the bank of
korea (target overnight call rate raised by 25 basis points to
4.50 per cent on august 10). in order to contain financial market
volatility arising from large liquidity flows, several central banks
have tended to tighten monetary policy, even at relatively low
current inflation rates, as in thailand, turkey, saudi arabia and
iceland. the saudi arabian monetary agency (sama) increased
its policy repo and reverse repo rates by 45 basis points during
2006 to contain the inflationary impact of petro-dollars, though
inflation in saudi arabia remains one of the lowest in the region
given extensive price controls and subsidies. in iceland, despite
a deceleration in inflation since november, the central bank
increased its policy rate to 14.25 per cent in december 2006,
which is the twelfth increase in last two years to contain the
price inflation in the housing market, investment boom and a
depreciation in the currency.
55.
a few central banks have sought to reinforce the increases
in key policy rates with increases in the reserve requirements. in
china, the required reserve ratio was raised by 50 basis points
each effective from july 5, august 15, november 15, 2006 and
28

january 15, 2007. the bank of korea raised reserve
requirements from 5 per cent to 7 per cent for local currency
deposits and short-term foreign currency deposits after 17 years
in november and december 2006, respectively. meanwhile, in
china and korea, central bank bonds have continued to absorb
liquidity from the banking system.
overall assessment
56.
the improvement in aggregate supply conditions, noted
in the mid-term review of october 2006, seems to have been
sustained in the ensuing period, driven by double-digit growth in
manufacturing and services. industrial activity has gathered
momentum on the back of manufacturing activity, supported by
mining and electricity generation. lead indicators point to the
sustained strength of growth in the services sector. agricultural
performance, on the other hand, has not been as sanguine with
output growth decelerating in the first half of 2006-07 in relation
to a year ago. supply-side pressures due to declines in the
production of rice, coarse cereals, oilseeds, pulses and cotton
have emerged as a source of concern for the near-term outlook,
especially in view of the relatively low levels of food stocks.
a fuller assessment of the rabi prospects would enable a more
informed forward-looking evaluation.
57.
there are continuing signs of aggregate demand firming
up. first, the pick-up in investment intentions and synchronous
high growth of capital goods production and capital goods imports
suggest that investment demand is strengthening further.
corporates are also reporting sustained business optimism and
rising capital expenditure. second, double-digit growth in the
production of consumer durables is reflecting the buoyancy of
29

consumer demand. third, the demand for bank credit remains
high, extending the high growth phase that began in 2004.
accordingly, concerns remain relating to credit quality and that
some banks may be overextended in terms of the balance
between sources and uses of funds, as reflected in high creditdeposit ratios. the growth in banks’ investments in government
and other approved securities appears to be low relative to
credit growth. excluding laf holdings, banks’ slr investments
are close to the statutory minimum which has implications for
liquidity management. credit growth is also being reflected in
the sizeable and higher than anticipated expansion in money
supply. fourth, on the external front, the trade deficit, which is a
relevant indicator of domestic demand conditions had expanded
to 6.5 per cent of gdp in 2005-06 and is set to rise even higher
in the current financial year. export growth has regained vigour,
but there are shifts in the pattern of imports. there are reports
that expansion of capacity may be constrained in terms of
pending import orders. fifth, there is increasing evidence that
the infrastructural bottlenecks are becoming tighter and more
binding. sixth, some indications of wage cost pressures seem to
be in evidence. surveys of corporate activity show that the staff
costs of the sampled firms increased sizeably in the first half of
2006-07, particularly for information technology (it) and services
companies. while staff costs in manufacturing firms have
increased at a more moderate pace, they are likely to face
incipient pressures on margins from rising input costs. seventh,
elevated asset prices are generating wealth effects which are
fuelling aggregate demand.
58.
in the mid-term review of october 2006, the reserve
bank had indicated the need to reckon with the dangers of
30

possible overheating even though there was no conclusive
evidence thereof. in the subsequent period, the relevant
signs, especially in terms of aggregate demand, have firmed up
as explained above. investment demand is strong and is
augmenting productive capacity. but it is also important to
recognise that the addition to productive capacity occurs with a
lag and the first sign of a step up in investment is reflected in
an expansion of aggregate demand. meanwhile, sizeable
capital inflows appear to have flowed into sectors such as real
estate which add to demand pressures, contributing to
sharp increases in asset prices as well as greater volatility in
financial markets.
59.
it is important to recognise that signs of overheating could
be transitional in nature. there is evidence of substantial
investment taking place, accompanied by overall productivity
increases which should add to potential output. furthermore,
the data indicate an upward shift in gross domestic saving and
investment rates which could provide the underpinnings for a
higher level of the structural component of growth. hence, the
policy challenge is to manage the transition to a higher growth
path while containing inflationary pressures so that potential
output and productivity are firmly entrenched in order to sustain
growth at the current level with the potential for further
acceleration. the objective of recent monetary policy initiatives
is to continue to maintain conditions of stability that contribute to
sustaining the momentum of growth on an enduring basis. in
this regard, it is relevant to note that when the crr was increased
in december, 2006 it was indicated inter alia that expansion of
capacity is underway but the realisation could be constrained
over the next two years.

financial markets have, by and large, remained stable.
money markets experienced generally orderly conditions along
with spells of tightening of liquidity in november and again from
mid-december. during these episodes, contrasting conditions
have often been observed when short-term interest rates have
firmed up despite laf absorptions but long-term rates have
declined in the government securities market. in december,
there was an inversion of the yield curve and a narrowing of
yield spreads. forward premia have firmed up in november and
december across the board in concert with the hardening of
short-term interest rates in the domestic money market segments.
on the other hand, asset prices, particularly equity prices, have
risen to record highs.
61.
up to november, 2006 total expenditure of the union
government had been higher than a year ago in relation to the
budget estimates in spite of cutbacks in capital expenditure. the
substantial increase in non-plan expenditure had been partly
accommodated by buoyant tax and non-tax revenue receipts.
accordingly, the gross fiscal deficit seems to have moderated
from its level a year ago as a proportion to the budget estimates.
the market borrowing programme is on course with a large part
having been successfully completed with some shortening of
the weighted average maturity and firming up of yields. there
are also indications of some improvement in state finances as
reflected in the steady increase in their cash balances and lower
recourse to ways and means advances/overdrafts.
62.
merchandise export growth has resumed strongly from a
dip in october, 2006. at the same time, imports of pol have
increased sizeably as in the previous year, but reflecting a sharp
increase in import volume in the current year. non-oil import
32

growth, which remained subdued in the early months of
2006-07, has picked up during the third quarter in consonance
with industrial activity. there are also reports of a substantial
pick up in bullion imports in october-november. while the
merchandise trade deficit has consequently widened, the
sustained surplus on account of invisibles is expected to contain
the current account deficit at well under two per cent of the
gdp. the capital flows to india have recovered from the
moderation during may-june 2006. accordingly, the current
account deficit is expected to be comfortably financed in the
remaining part of the year.
63.
it is important to undertake a careful assessment of factors
affecting inflation expectations. first, prices of primary food
articles continue to remain firm and the usual seasonal decline
since november has been muted during the current financial
year. second, prices of manufactured products have also
exhibited upward movement. third, surveys of business suggest
that capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector has risen.
fourth, indications of demand pressures have been incipiently
building up as reflected in increasing consumption and investment
demand. fifth, the sizeable expansion in the demand for bank
credit continues to pose concerns. sixth, asset prices appear
to have risen even beyond the elevated levels at the time of
the mid-term review. seventh, international crude prices have
moderated considerably and are expected to remain around the
current levels in the near future. accordingly, the pass-through
to domestic prices of petrol and diesel can be assumed to be
complete. however, it is necessary to recognise that headline
inflation has hardened and has moved beyond the projection of
the reserve bank only on four occasions during the fiscal year,
viz., in the weeks ending october 21 and december 30, 2006
33

and january 6 and january 13, 2007. these spikes in inflation
have been contributed to by base effects, supply-side constraints
and demand pressures. overall, the impact of these
developments on inflation perceptions due to rise in prices of
food articles and on inflation expectations, in general, warrant a
determined policy response by all concerned to quell such
adverse developments for several critical reasons.
64.
in recognition of the cumulative and lagged effects of
monetary policy, the reserve bank began a graduated withdrawal
of accommodation in mid-2003 in spite of inflation being within
its tolerance band. since september, 2004 repo/reverse repo
rates have been increased by 125/150 basis points, the crr
has been raised by 100 basis points, risk weights have been
raised in the case of housing loans (from 50 per cent to 75 per
cent), commercial real estate (from 100 per cent to 150 per
cent) and consumer credit (from 100 per cent to
125 per cent) and general provisioning requirement for standard
advances in specific sectors has been raised to 1.0 per cent of
standard advances. the stance of monetary policy has
progressively shifted from an equal emphasis on price stability
along with growth to one of reinforcing price stability with
immediate monetary measures and to take recourse to all
possible measures promptly in response to evolving
circumstances.
65.
in the global economy, the balance of growth seems to
be shifting away from the us towards the euro area, japan and
the emerging economies. there is some evidence that the
slowing in housing in the us has significant elements of an
inventory correction. non-residential investment remains strong.
pressure from energy prices has ebbed, while unemployment
34

appears to have fallen. in japan, domestic demand is seen as
holding the key to sustaining the recovery. in the euro area,
domestic demand and employment are picking up and the outlook
for growth is optimistic. in emerging asia and in latin america,
the outlook for growth remains positive, supported by external
demand, although there are concerns relating to the possible
us slowdown. in the overall assessment, the global outlook
continues to be favourable for the prospects of countries like
india, although persisting geopolitical risks remain a potential
threat to growth and stability worldwide.
66.
in industrial countries, headline inflation has eased
somewhat, but core inflation has remained firm. while global oil
prices may have stabilised, non-oil inflation has been rising
steadily and it is feared that sooner or later, wage pressures
would build up. monetary policy authorities in inflation-targeting
countries are facing the difficult situation of inflation prevailing
above the target over a prolonged period. even as long-term
inflation expectations have trended down, interpreting short-run
fluctuations is becoming complicated by uncertainty about how
strongly these expectations could get revised and which factors
might trigger the revision. therefore, while there are several
factors holding down inflation expectations, central banks consider
it important to strengthen the pursuit of price stability.
67.
global financial markets have been reasonably stable
while re-pricing risks. short-term interest rates have firmed up
since october, but long-term bond yields have fallen, translating
into a steeper inversion of the yield curve. foreign exchange
markets have been recording lower levels of volatility in recent
weeks than before. most emerging market currencies have made
modest gains against the us dollar. global equity markets have
35

posted steady gains, except in japan, boosted by the ebbing of
crude prices and the pause in us policy rates. a pick-up in
merger and acquisition activity has also supported equity prices.
it is important to recognise that in the current environment of
relatively low interest rates which, in turn, affect risk-pricing by
financial markets, even small changes in interest rates can
produce large changes in asset prices and associated volatility,
as noticed in the global sell-offs in equity markets during
may-june, 2006. accordingly, policy authorities as well as market
constituents need to be watchful and prepared for sudden
fluctuations in asset prices which can have significant real sector
effects.
68.
in line with developments in the major markets, emerging
equity markets in asia and latin america have continued to
recover from the may-june sell-off. the markets which suffered
the largest losses have more than recouped earlier losses.
perceptions of sound fundamentals in many emerging
economies, reflected in stable ratings and the resurgence of
investor interest in dedicated emerging market funds, have
enabled international issuances of debt and equity from these
economies, with some countries replacing foreign currency debt
by local currency debt. private issuances have far exceeded
sovereign issues as firms took advantage of favourable market
conditions.
69.
in india, recent developments, in particular, the
combination of high growth and firming inflation, coupled with
escalating asset prices and tightening infrastructural bottlenecks,
have complicated the conduct of monetary policy. the enduring
strength of capital inflows poses a challenge to monetary and
liquidity management. in the event of demand pressures building
36

up, increases in interest rates may be advocated to sustain
growth in a non-inflationary manner but such action, apart from
associated costs for growth and potential risks to financial stability,
increases the possibility of further capital inflows so long as a
significant part of these flows is interest sensitive and explicit
policies to moderate flows are not undertaken. these flows can
potentially reduce the efficacy of monetary policy tightening by
enhancing liquidity.
70.
in the overall assessment, there are shifts underway in
the patterns of global growth even while inflation expectations
remain stable at present. while risks to the outlook from the
contraction in the us housing market, rising food and metal
prices remain, global financial markets remain vulnerable to
sudden shifts in expectations and volatility, as experienced in
the recent period. there are concerns relating to the uncertainty
surrounding international crude prices. while crude prices have
moderated recently, geo-political risks remain. central banks
are, by and large, persisting with withdrawal of monetary
accommodation. global factors, by themselves, do not seem to
warrant a policy response; however, corporates and financial
intermediaries need to be aware of sudden reversals in sentiment
in global financial markets unrelated to economic fundamentals,
especially if triggered by geo-political factors. banks are,
therefore, advised to ensure the hedging of their exposures and
to undertake pre-emptive strategies to insulate their balance
sheets from currency and interest rate risks.
71.
in the light of the above, a three-pronged approach is
warranted at this juncture. first, early warning signals emanating
from rising inflation in an environment of high money and credit
growth indicate that monetary policy is still accommodative,
37

warranting a policy response. accordingly, a measured increase
in interest rates should be appropriate in assuaging demand
pressures. second, there are also abiding concerns relating to
the persistently high credit growth and the potential for erosion
in the quality of credit. it is in this context that balance sheets of
banks need to be fortified against the build-up of loan
delinquencies by precautionary provisioning and a greater
sensitivity to underlying risks by enhancement of risk weights
applied to advances to specific sectors in which banks’ exposures
have been rising at a fast pace. third, there are also indications
that capital inflows are likely to be sustained with expansionary
effects carrying potential inflationary pressures and attenuating
monetary and liquidity management. in particular, inflows into
non-resident deposit schemes have recorded sizeable increases
during the year in response to interest rate differentials. therefore,
it is important to modulate these flows appropriately so as to
ensure effective liquidity management. in all the three areas, a
continuous process of rebalancing the relative emphasis between
growth and stability is critical while devising specific measures
from time to time.

38

ii. stance of monetary policy
72.
at the end of october 2006, i.e., at the time of the
mid-term review, the outlook for global growth and inflation
was positive but uncertain with no definitive indications for the
course of monetary policy. on the other hand, early signs of
overheating in the domestic economy were recognised as too
risky to ignore. accordingly, the repo rate under the laf was
raised by 25 basis points with immediate effect on october 31,
2006 while keeping the reverse repo rate unchanged. in
continuation of the stance of the annual policy statement of
april 2006 and the first quarter review of july, the mid-term
review of october set the stance of monetary policy for the
period ahead in terms of ensuring a monetary and interest rate
environment that sustains the growth momentum while securing
price stability and anchoring inflation expectations. the emphasis
on macroeconomic and financial stability was reinforced with a
readiness to consider appropriate, immediate measures and all
possible measures promptly in response to the evolving global
and domestic outlook.
73.
in the subsequent months, macroeconomic performance
has turned out to be somewhat better than anticipated on the
back of strong growth in manufacturing and services. against
this background, with a view to draining excess liquidity and
pre-empting upward pressures on inflation expectations, it was
decided to increase the crr of the scbs, regional rural banks
(rrbs), scheduled state co-operative banks and scheduled
primary (urban) co-operative banking system by one-half of one
percentage point of their ndtl in two stages, to 5.25 per cent
and 5.50 per cent, effective from the fortnights beginning
december 23, 2006 and january 06, 2007, respectively. with
39

this increase in the crr, an amount of about rs.13,500 crore
of resources of banks was sought to be absorbed. the increase
in the crr announced on december 8, 2006 was consistent
with the stance of the mid-term review of october 2006 of
containing inflation expectations in the current environment and
consolidating gains achieved so far in regard to stability in order
to sustain the momentum of growth on an enduring basis.
74.
financial markets have responded to these developments
with some tightening of liquidity conditions, re-pricing and
corrections in valuations. except for the first half of december,
short-term interest rates have generally risen. contrastingly,
long-term yields have declined, resulting in a narrowing
of yield spreads and an inversion of the yield curve. in the
credit market, buoyant deposit growth has considerably alleviated
the financing constraint on the banking system. nevertheless,
both deposit and lending rates have edged up in recent months.
in the foreign exchange market, sustained inflows, aided
by a combination of global and domestic developments, have
comfortably accommodated a modest current account deficit
and have been reflected in an appreciating exchange rate. equity
markets have been driven up by strong rallies, with some
intermittent corrections. the policy incentive structure for external
investment is favourable to real estate and the capital market,
leading to sizeable inflows and rising asset prices.
75.
real gdp growth originating from agricultural and allied
activities has been somewhat lower than expected in the first
half of 2006-07, based on the likely production in the kharif
season. pending a clearer assessment of the kharif crop
performance and taking into account the favourable water storage
conditions that should augur well for the rabi season, it is
40

reasonable to expect that agriculture will maintain its trend growth
of 3.0 per cent as anticipated in the annual policy statement
and the mid-term review. on the other hand, the momentum
of growth has been sustained in the industrial and service sectors
and the outlook remains bright. accordingly, real gdp growth
for 2006-07 is currently expected to be in the range of 8.5-9.0
per cent as compared with around 8.0 per cent projected in the
mid-term review and 7.5-8.0 per cent in the annual policy
statement and the first quarter review.
76.
against this backdrop, the outlook for inflation assumes
criticality in terms of policy monitoring and action. prices of food
articles will have considerable impact on headline inflation over
the rest of the year. the seasonal decline in prices of food
articles in the second half of the year has been less than normal.
prices of manufactures are firming up and were close to the
headline level by the end of december, 2006. the recent
initiatives by the government of india should give comfort to the
inflation outlook on account of both primary articles and
manufactured products. the benefit of the reduction in prices of
petrol and diesel, which came into effect in end-november, should
help moderate the pressures. as regards the outlook on
international crude prices, the probability of current levels being
maintained is high, though some geo-political risks remain. the
recent monetary policy measures, in particular, the increase in
the crr in december 2006 should work towards containing
inflation expectations. on the way forward, it should be possible
to build on the timely and pre-emptive actions taken so far to
address issues of price stability and related expectations.
77.
it is generally recognised that persistence of high inflation
not only operates as a tax on the poor but also undermines
41

economic growth and macroeconomic stability in several ways.
while the objectives of monetary policy in india are growth and
price stability, the relative emphasis depends on the context. in
the prevailing conditions of growth, price and financial stability,
unequivocal relative emphasis on stability is warranted in the
current context for several reasons. high growth benefits all but
the benefits to the poor accrue in a lagged fashion. while the
benefits of high growth often percolate to the poor with a time
lag, the impact of high prices has no such time lag and is, in
fact, immediate. furthermore, the impact of inflation is
asymmetrical in our society since only about ten per cent of the
work-force, which is in the organised sector, has an inflation
hedge, while the rest do not have any inflation hedging
mechanism. moreover, the adverse impact of inflation on the
poor would be particularly severe if the prices of basic necessities
of life increase. hence, a determined and co-ordinated effort by
all to contain inflation without unduly impacting the growth
momentum is not only an economic necessity but also a moral
compulsion. to the extent the current inflationary pressures are
attributable to monetary conditions, it is essential to undertake
appropriate measures, in continuation of those already taken
and in the light of anticipated developments.
78.
in our economy, large segments of economic agents may
not have adequate resilience to withstand volatility in currency
and money markets. a large segment of population is at a level of
living which would warrant minimising the risk of large disruption
in their monetary and financial conditions, however temporary it
may be. these factors lend additional weight in favour of monetary
stability and avoidance of imbalances in the financial system. the
reserve bank’s policies are, therefore, vigilant to any indications
of volatility in currency and money markets.
42

79.
on the basis of available evidence, global growth continues
to be strong but is exhibiting mixed patterns. global imbalances
continue to grow, but no immediate correction or hard landing is
anticipated. in the global financial markets, current indications
suggest that the risks remain under-priced and it is debatable as
to whether this is on account of ex ante excess saving or underinvestment. there are indications that the risks have become
more diversified. it is important to recognise, however, that these
risks do not disappear. consequently, there is an increasing
discomfort of the possibility of tail risk materialising. the incentive
mechanism of large financial intermediaries, especially hedge
funds, tends to under-price risks in such situations. international
futures markets are predicting that current levels of crude prices
may hold, at least over the next six months. consequently, the
concern surrounding the imbalances has shifted to the evolution
of global liquidity and unknown risks. there are some forecasts
which suggest that external flows to emerging markets would
moderate in the coming months and, along with monetary policy
tightening and reduction in oil surpluses, would reduce global
liquidity. in brief, the outlook is more unclear than before and
geo-political risks remain significant, requiring a close and careful
monitoring of their evolution.
80.
the experience of several emerging economies in recent
months has shown that sharp movements in exchange rates
can take place in a very short period even when no changes in
fundamentals are noticed. it is true that recent episodes in the
emes did not involve contagion and that these economies have
shown resilience in bouncing back, aided by prompt and
appropriate policy responses. the fact remains that in these
affected emes, there has been extreme volatility in financial
markets, unrelated to fundamentals, which cause disruptions to
43

normal activity and leave some permanent impact on the
real sector balance sheets. there is, therefore, increasing
recognition among policymakers of the need to contain extreme
volatility in capital flows and, in some cases, consequent liquidity
conditions also.
81.
at this point in time, the conduct of monetary policy is
confronted with three important issues. first, demand pressures
appear to have intensified, reflected in rising inflation, high money
and credit growth, elevated asset prices, strains on capacity
utilisation, some indications of wage pressures and widening of
the trade deficit. second, there are increased supply side
pressures in evidence from prices of primary articles. third,
monetary policy will have to contend with the lagged response
of productive capacity and infrastructure to the ongoing expansion
in investment. by current indications, monetary policy may have
to reckon with the accentuation of some of the identified pressures
warranting reinforcement of the stance and actions articulated in
the annual policy statement of april 2006 and subsequent
reviews. as in the past, the conduct of monetary policy depends
on multiple indicators and recourse to multiple instruments which
encompasses, besides the standard monetary measures,
prudential measures as well, due to segmentation in the financial
markets and evolving market orientation of large financial
intermediaries.
82.
evolving conditions underscore the importance of
persevering with further withdrawal of policy accommodation in
a timely manner to ensure both price and financial stability. a
judicious balancing of weights assigned to monetary policy
objectives would accord priority to stability in order to support
growth on a sustained basis. accordingly, an appropriate
44

response in terms of policy stance and monetary measures is
warranted at this juncture. in essence, the conduct of monetary
policy in india at the current juncture involves operating on three
mutually influencing and interacting tracks: ensuring price stability
while recognising the objective reality of lags in monetary policy
efficacy; anchoring inflation expectations which, in turn, depend
on public perceptions as well as the sources of inflationary
pressures; and contending with rising asset prices.
83.
it is essential to recognise the links between accelerating
inflation and escalating asset prices, even when no view is taken
on the appropriateness of such levels of asset prices. large
movements in asset prices impact consumer demand through
wealth effects and often, accelerating inflation tends to encourage
investments in assets as a hedge. thus, concerted actions in
fiscal, external, monetary and prudential policies would be
appropriate to meet such mutually reinforcing situations. in this
background, provisioning requirements in the banking sector are
being enhanced to sectors such as real estate, capital markets
and consumer loans.
84.
the continued high credit growth in the real estate sector,
outstanding credit card receivables, loans and advances
qualifying as capital market exposure and personal loans is a
matter of concern. furthermore, the data reveal higher default
rates in regard to credit card receivables and personal loans. it
has, therefore, become imperative to increase the provisioning
requirement in respect of the standard assets in the aforesaid
four categories of loans and advances (excluding residential
housing loans) to two per cent from the existing level of one per
cent. the provisioning requirement in respect of residential
housing loans will remain unchanged at 0.4 per cent for loans
45

up to rs.20 lakh and at one per cent for loans in excess of
rs.20 lakh. it has also been decided to increase the provisioning
requirement for banks’ exposures in the standard assets category
to the non-deposit taking systemically important non-banking
financial companies (nbfcs) to two per cent from the existing
level of 0.4 per cent and to increase the risk weight for banks’
exposure to such nbfcs to 125 per cent from the existing level
of 100 per cent. provisioning requirements and risk weights for
banks’ exposures to asset finance companies will remain
unchanged. in order to ensure continued and adequate availability
of credit to highly productive sectors of the economy, the risk
weights for all other categories of exposures also remain
unchanged. similarly, the provisioning requirements in regard to
agricultural loans, loans to smes and loans to industry, in general,
remain unchanged.
85.
asset prices in capital markets as well as in real estate
are influenced by relative fiscal incentives and external sector
policies, in addition to overall liquidity conditions. there is merit
in moderating additions to liquidity from large capital inflows
and, hence, some changes in administered rates relating to
non-resident deposits are considered appropriate. these have
to be viewed as part of several measures undertaken to moderate
liquidity with a view to enabling continuous re-balancing in the
relative emphasis between growth and price stability, including
financial stability.
86.
a sizeable increase in non-resident (external) rupee
account [nr(e)ra] and foreign currency non-resident (banks)
[fcnr(b)] deposits has been observed in 2006-07 so far. at the
same time, there are reports of large growth in advances being
granted against such deposits. it may be recalled that, based on
46

the prevailing monetary conditions, the interest rate ceilings on
nr(e)ra and fcnr(b) deposits have been reviewed on an
ongoing basis and have been adjusted on several occasions. in
the current context, it has been decided to reduce the interest
rate ceilings on nr(e)ra and fcnr(b) deposits by 50 basis
points and 25 basis points, respectively. furthermore, keeping
in view the objective of making these facilities available to
individual nris and considering the prevailing monetary
conditions, there is merit in avoiding upward pressure on asset
prices in sensitive sectors through utilisation of this facility.
pending a review of the extent of large advances to high net
worth individuals, banks are being prohibited from granting fresh
loans in excess of rs. 20 lakh against the nr(e)ra and fcnr(b)
deposits, either to depositors or to third parties. banks are also
being advised not to undertake artificial slicing of the loan amount
to circumvent the ceiling.
87.
in recognition of the rising inflationary pressures, the
government of india has moved in a determined fashion in
recent weeks to contain inflation expectations. with a view to
reducing manufacturing costs, customs duty on specified capital
goods and parts thereof, project goods and extensions has been
reduced from 12.5/10 per cent to 7.5 per cent. the duty on
inorganic chemicals, base metals of primary and semi-finished
form, ferro-alloys, stainless steel and other alloy steel has been
reduced to 5.0 per cent. portland cement has been exempted
from customs duty. in order to contain pressures from prices of
essential commodities, the customs duty on edible oils has been
reduced, in addition to exempting maize, wheat and pulses.
furthermore, a ban has been imposed on forward trading of tur
and urad to minimise price volatility. while the recent actions
taken by the government are welcome and support the
47

continuum of monetary measures undertaken since october
2004, it is important to reiterate that effective containment of
inflationary pressures is best served by a combination of fiscal,
external and supply management policies, supplemented and
complemented by ongoing implementation of monetary
measures.
88.
inflation, to the extent it is a monetary phenomenon,
demands timely and credible monetary policy actions, recognising
the lagged effects of such policies. thus, the current package of
measures should be viewed not only as complementing the
lagged effects of the actions already taken but also as meeting
the emerging pressures on price stability, and more importantly,
inflationary expectations. the monetary measures are meant to
complement the fiscal and supply-side measures already
undertaken in the recent period. this is in consonance with the
annual policy statement for 2006-07 as well as the mid-term
review which state that the policy endeavour is to contain
year-on-year inflation for 2006-07 in the range of 5.0 to 5.5 per
cent. the objective of the policy measures being undertaken at
the current juncture would be to bring the inflation as close as
possible to the stated range of 5.0 to 5.5 per cent at the earliest,
while continuing to pursue the medium-term goal of a ceiling on
inflation at 5.0 per cent.
89.
over the remaining part of the year, management of
liquidity would receive priority in the policy hierarchy. consequent
to the tightening of market liquidity, the impact of monetary policy
is expected to be stronger than before. the reserve bank would
use all policy instruments, including the crr, to ensure the
appropriate modulation of liquidity in responding to the evolving
situation. it is important to note that bank credit continues to
48

grow at a rapid pace for the third year in succession and the
rates of growth are clearly excessive, warranting measures to
moderate growth even after accounting for the relatively low
level of credit penetration in our country and the structural
transformation of the economy that is underway. banks have
been drawing down their investments in gilts sizeably to
accommodate credit demand, including to levels close to the
minimum slr in some cases. mismatches between the sources
and uses of funds persist. the system level incremental
non-food credit-deposit ratio remains high at 91 per cent, but at
even higher levels for some banks. the depletion of slr
investments by banks has resulted in anomalous situations in
which call rates have firmed up to the ceiling of the laf corridor
and beyond even when reverse repo bids have been received
under the laf and funds have been absorbed from the system.
this indicates that some banks are clearly overdrawn in terms
of both collateral and cash, necessitating recourse to rollovers
at the short end of the market spectrum and consequent
pressures on liquidity and interest rates. banks need to recognise
that shortage of slr securities could constrain their recourse to
laf liquidity, which can turn adverse in critical times, forcing
them to resort to uncollateralised exposures and attendant risks.
banks should be aware that accessing the reserve bank’s
window for funds should be for very temporary periods and for
equilibrating very short-term mismatches. the use of such
resources for on-lending by banks needs to be eschewed.
90.
the reserve bank will ensure that appropriate liquidity is
maintained in the system so that all legitimate requirements of
credit are met, particularly for productive purposes, consistent
with the objective of price and financial stability. towards this
end, the reserve bank will continue with its policy of active
49

demand management of liquidity through open market operations
(omo) including the mss, laf and crr, and using all the
policy instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the
situation warrants.
91.
in sum, barring the emergence of any adverse and
unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy
and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy
including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary
policy in the period ahead will be:
•

to reinforce the emphasis on price stability and
well-anchored inflation expectations while ensuring a
monetary and interest rate environment that supports
export and investment demand in the economy so as
to enable continuation of the growth momentum.

•

to re-emphasise credit quality and orderly conditions
in financial markets for securing macroeconomic and,
in particular, financial stability while simultaneously
pursuing greater credit penetration and financial
inclusion.

•

to respond swiftly with all possible measures as
appropriate to the evolving global and domestic
situation impinging on inflation expectations and the
growth momentum.

95.
the reserve bank retains the option to conduct overnight
repo or longer term repo under the laf depending on market
conditions and other relevant factors. the reserve bank will
continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or reject
tender(s) under the laf, wholly or partially, if deemed fit, so as to
make efficient use of the laf in daily liquidity management.
