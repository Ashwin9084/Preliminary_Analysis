third bi-monthly monetary policy statement, 2016-17
by
dr. raghuram g. rajan, governor
monetary and liquidity measures
on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic
situation, it has been decided to:
•

keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (laf)
unchanged at 6.5 per cent;

•

keep the cash reserve ratio (crr) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per
cent of net demand and time liabilities (ndtl); and

•

continue to provide liquidity as required but progressively lower the average ex
ante liquidity deficit in the system from one per cent of ndtl to a position
closer to neutrality.

consequently, the reverse repo rate under the laf will remain unchanged at
6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (msf) rate and the bank rate at 7.0
per cent.
assessment
2.
since the second bi-monthly statement of june 2016, several developments
have clouded the outlook for the global economy. across advanced economies
(aes), growth in q2 of 2016 has been slower than anticipated, and the outlook is still
mixed. headwinds in the united states from declining inventory investment were
offset somewhat by strong payroll numbers. in the euro area, the re-emergence of
stress in some parts of the banking sector and the brexit vote increased uncertainty.
in japan, downside risks have intensified in the form of a stronger yen, deflationary
risks and contracting industrial production, triggering monetary and fiscal stimuli.
3.
among emerging market economies, activity remains varied. gdp growth
stabilised in china in q2, on the back of strong stimulus. manufacturing activity was
weak in july due to adverse weather and subdued export demand, although smaller
firms recorded an uptick in new orders. recessionary conditions are gradually
diminishing in brazil and russia, but the near-term outlook is still fragile due to policy
uncertainties and soft commodity prices.

2
4.
world trade remains sluggish in the first half of 2016. international financial
markets did not anticipate the brexit vote and equities plunged worldwide, currency
volatility increased and investors herded into safe havens. since then, however,
equity markets have regained lost ground. currencies, barring the pound sterling,
have stabilised, with the yen appreciating the most on risk-on demand as well as the
announcement of fresh stimulus. yields on government bonds have fallen further and
the universe of negative yielding assets is expanding at a fast pace, reflecting high
risk aversion and expectations of further monetary accommodation by systemic
central banks. crude prices, which had risen to an intra-year high in may on supply
disruptions, remain volatile. other commodity prices, barring those of precious
metals, remain soft due to weak demand.
5.
on the domestic front, several factors are helping to support the recovery.
after a delayed onset, the south west monsoon picked up vigorously from the third
week of june. by early august, the cumulative rainfall was 3 per cent higher than the
long period average, with more than 80 per cent of the country receiving normal to
excess precipitation. kharif sowing strengthened after a lacklustre start, particularly
with respect to pulses. barring cotton, jute and mesta, sowing of all crops is currently
above last year’s acreage. these developments engender greater confidence about
the near-term outlook for value added in agriculture. the target for kharif production
set by the ministry of agriculture appears within reach.
6.
industrial production picked up in may on the back of manufacturing and
mining, following a contraction in the preceding month. the uneven performance of
industrial output reflects the lumpy and order-driven contraction of insulated rubber
cables, a component of capital goods. excluding this item, industrial production rose
at 3.0 per cent in the current financial year. in fact, capital goods production
excluding insulated rubber cables expanded by 8.0 per cent. nonetheless, the
prolonged sluggishness in the capital goods sector is indicative of weak investment
demand. the rate of contraction in consumer non-durables slowed, pointing to some
revival in rural demand. on the other hand, the pace of growth of consumer durables
has been stable and buoyed by urban consumption demand, although it eased in
may on base effects. barring the contraction in natural gas and crude oil on account
of structural bottlenecks, the core sector has been resilient as of 2016-17 so far, and
should support industrial activity going forward. there are some signs of green
shoots in manufacturing too, with purchasing managers and the reserve bank’s
industrial outlook survey indicating a pick-up in new orders, both domestic and
external. business confidence is also looking up in recent months, though the
reserve bank’s survey for march 2016 suggests that capacity utilisation, seasonally
adjusted, is still weak.
7.
service sector purchasing managers polled the thirteenth successive month
of expansion in july on the basis of a sharp acceleration in new business. business
expectations remained optimistic on better economic conditions and planned
increases in marketing budgets. high frequency indicators of service sector activity
are still, however, emitting mixed signals, although a larger number of indicators are
in acceleration mode in q1 of 2016-17 than in the preceding quarter. automobile
sales across most segments, railway, port and international air freight traffic, foreign
tourist arrivals, and domestic air passenger traffic are providing the underlying
momentum for the upturn. the gradual improvement in the services sector is getting
broad-based.
8.
retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (cpi) rose to
a 22-month high in june, with a sharp pick-up in momentum overwhelming

3
favourable base effects. the rise was mainly driven by food, with vegetable inflation
higher than the usual seasonal rise at this time of the year. sugar prices also firmed
up due to a decline in domestic production after two successive years of drought.
while pulses inflation started moderating, prices of pulses have been rising again
since april after a short-lived correction in the previous quarter. inflation pressures
are also incipient in cereals. these developments fed through into households’
inflation expectations three months ahead, reversing the decline seen in the last two
quarters.
9.
fuel inflation remained subdued, mainly due to sustained deflation in prices of
liquefied petroleum gas. excluding food and fuel, inflation eased across major subgroups. further excluding petrol and diesel from transport, inflation fell below 5 per
cent for the first time since the introduction of the combined cpi. softer inflation
readings were recorded across services constituents in health, education, personal
care and effects, and other categories of household consumption. rural wage growth
has been rising albeit moderately, driven up by wages of agricultural labourers. on
the other hand, staff costs in the organised sector were relatively restrained.
10.
liquidity conditions eased significantly during june and july on the back of
increased spending by the government which more than offset the reduction in
market liquidity because of higher-than-usual currency demand. the injection of
durable liquidity through purchases under open market operations (omos),
amounting to
805 billion so far, also helped in easing liquidity conditions, bringing
the system-level ex ante liquidity deficit to close to neutrality (albeit without seasonal
adjustment). accordingly, the average daily liquidity operation switched from net
injection of liquidity of
370 billion in june to net absorption of
141 billion in july
and
405 billion in august (up to august 8). the reserve bank conducted variable
rate repos and reverse repos of varying tenors in order to manage evolving liquidity
conditions, with a more active use of reverse repos to manage the surplus liquidity.
reflecting the easy liquidity conditions, the weighted average call rate (wacr) and
money market weighted average rate remained on average 15 basis points below the
policy repo rate since june. interest rates on other money market instruments such
as certificates of deposit (cds) and commercial paper (cps) have also declined in
both the primary and secondary markets.
11.
in the external sector, merchandise export growth moved into positive territory
in june after eighteen months. this upturn was reasonably widespread, covering
chemicals, marine products, handicraft, plastic, rice, electronic and engineering
goods. on the other hand, imports continued to decline, albeit at a slower pace than
in recent months. while lower crude oil prices continued to compress the pol import
bill, domestic demand for gold remained muted, with domestic gold prices trading at a
discount vis-a-vis international prices. non-oil non-gold imports continued to shrink,
pulled down by coal, fertilisers, ores, iron and steel and machinery and transport
equipment. cumulatively, the trade deficit narrowed in q1 of 2016-17 on a year-onyear basis. net receipts on account of services remained flat in april-may 2016, with
net outflow under communication services and sluggish software earnings. while the
pace of foreign direct investment inflows slowed in the first two months of 2016-17,
net portfolio flows were stronger after the brexit vote, notwithstanding considerable
volatility characterising these flows. the level of foreign exchange reserves rose to
us$ 365.7 billion by august 5, 2016.

4
policy stance and rationale
12.
the recent sharper-than-anticipated increase in food prices has pushed up the
projected trajectory of inflation over the rest of the year. moreover, prices of pulses
and cereals are rising and services inflation remains somewhat sticky. there are
early indications, however, that prices of vegetables are edging down. going forward,
the strong improvement in sowing on the back of the monsoon’s steady progress,
along with supply management measures, augers well for the food inflation outlook.
the prospects for inflation excluding food and fuel are more uncertain; if the current
softness in crude prices proves to be transient and as the output gap continues to
close, inflation excluding food and fuel may likely trend upwards and counterbalance
the benefit of the expected easing of food inflation. in addition, the full implementation
of the recommendations of the 7th central pay commission (cpc) on allowances will
affect the magnitude of the direct effect of house rents on the cpi. on balance,
inflation projections as given in the june bi-monthly statement, i.e. of a central
trajectory towards 5 per cent by march 2017 with risks tilted to the upside, are
retained (chart 1).

13.
looking ahead, the momentum of growth is expected to be quickened by the
normal monsoon raising agricultural growth and rural demand, as well as by the
stimulus to consumption spending that can be expected from the disbursement of
pay, pension and arrears following the implementation of the 7th cpc’s award. the
passage of the goods and services tax (gst) bill augurs well for the growing
political consensus for economic reforms. while timely implementation of gst will be
challenging, there is no doubt that it should raise returns to investment across much
of the economy, even while strengthening government finances over the mediumterm. this should boost business sentiment and eventually investment. the current
accommodative stance of monetary policy and comfortable liquidity conditions should
also provide a congenial environment for the reinvigoration of aggregate demand
conditions. however, successive downgrades of global growth projections by
multilateral agencies and the continuing sluggishness in world trade points to further
slackening of external demand going forward. accordingly, the gva growth
projection for 2016-17 is retained at 7.6 per cent, with risks facing the economy at
this juncture evenly balanced around it (chart 2).

14.
risks to the inflation target of 5 per cent for march 2017 continue to be on the
upside. furthermore, while the direct statistical effect of house rent allowances under
the 7th cpc’s award may be looked through, its impact on inflation expectations will
have to be carefully monitored so as to pre-empt a generalisation of inflation
pressures. in terms of immediate outcomes, much will depend on the benign effects
of the monsoon on food prices.
15.
in view of this configuration of risks, it is appropriate for the reserve bank to
keep the policy repo rate unchanged at this juncture, while awaiting space for policy
action. the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and will continue to
emphasise the adequate provision of liquidity. easy liquidity conditions are already
prompting banks to modestly transmit past policy rate cuts through their mclrs and
pro-active liquidity management should facilitate more pass-through.
16.
it may be recalled that the refinements to the liquidity management framework
effected in april 2016 were intended to smooth the supply of durable liquidity over the
year using asset purchases and sales as needed, and progressively lower the
average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system to a position closer to neutrality. the
reserve bank intends to continue with this strategy, with the intention of closing the
underlying liquidity deficit over time so that the system moves to a position of
structural balance. as regards the management of the imminent fcnr(b)
redemptions, the reserve bank has been frontloading liquidity provision through
open market operations and spot interventions/deliveries of forward purchases. the
reserve bank will continue with both domestic liquidity operations and foreign
exchange interventions that should also enable management of the fcnr(b)
redemptions without market disruptions. with a view to further front-loading the
provision of liquidity, it has been decided to conduct an open market purchase
auction on august 11, 2016. details are being announced separately.
17.
the fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement will be announced on
october 4, 2016.
