first quarter review of monetary policy 2009-10
by
dr. d. subbarao
governor
the global economy is showing
incipient signs of stabilisation, albeit not
recovery. the pace of decline in economic
activity in several major advanced
economies has slowed, frozen credit markets
have thawed and equity markets have
begun to recover. recent months have
witnessed industrial activity reviving in a
number of emerging market economies
(emes) such as china, korea, brazil and
india. notwithstanding some positive signs,
the path and the time horizon for global
recovery remain uncertain. consumption
demand remains subdued as unemployment
levels have risen. business and consumer
confidence are yet to show definitive signs
of revival. global trade, according to the
international monetary fund (imf), is
projected to shrink by over 12 per cent in
2009; private capital flows are also expected
to decline. the continuing process of
balance sheet adjustment by both households
and businesses is inhibiting recovery in
many economies. reflecting these several
uncertainties, the imf, in its latest world
economic outlook (weo) update released
in july 2009, has further revised downwards
the global growth forecast for 2009 to (-)1.4
per cent from its april 2009 forecast of
(-)1.3 per cent.
2.
the crisis, which affected the
global financial system and engulfed most

countries of the world, had all the
ingredients for a severe disruption of the
world economy on the scale of the great
depression. however, it was mitigated by
bold, large and decisive actions taken in
concert by governments and central banks
in each country, and which came to be
increasingly co-ordinated across countries.
consequently, while the financial sector
appears to be stabilising, economic
recession in the real sector persists.
3.
the indian economy experienced
a significant slowdown in 2008-09 in
comparison with the robust growth
performance in the preceding five years,
largely due to the knock-on effect of the
global financial crisis. the worst hit has
been the export sector, which has been
recording negative growth since october
2008. this, in turn, impacted the
manufacturing sector. investment demand
was also dented by the decline in corporate
profitability and increased uncertainties
about future prospects. private
consumption decelerated significantly. the
services sector, which has been the main
driver of growth for more than a decade,
also slowed down. the financial sector,
however, remained relatively unaffected
despite the severe stress caused by the
global deleveraging process, which

triggered capital outflows in the second half
of 2008-09.

monsoon has increased the downside risks
to agricultural production.

4.
quick and aggressive policy
responses both by the government and the
reserve bank mitigated the adverse impact
of the global financial crisis. the large
domestic demand bolstered by government
consumption, provision of forex and rupee
liquidity coupled with sharp cuts in
policy rates, a sound banking sector and
well-functioning financial markets helped
cushion the economy from the worst impact
of the crisis. there are now signs of an
upturn in industrial production and revival
of credit demand, though the delayed

5.
this first quarter review of
monetary policy for 2009-10 is thus set in
the context of a stabilising global economy
and gradually recovering domestic economy.
it is organised in three sections. section i
provides an assessment of the macroeconomic
and monetary developments; section ii
delineates the stance of monetary policy;
and section iii sets out the monetary
measures. this review should be read and
understood together with the detailed review
of macroeconomic and monetary
developments released yesterday.

i. macroeconomic and monetary developments
has projected real gdp of the us to
shrink by 2.6 per cent in 2009, a slight
improvement from a contraction of 2.8
per cent projected in the april weo. the
main macroeconomic indicators continued
to be adverse in q2 of 2009 with the
unemployment rate increasing to 9.5
per cent in june 2009 accompanied by a dip
in wage growth, industrial production,
capacity utilisation and consumer sentiment.

global outlook
6.
the deterioration in the global
outlook that started in september 2008
continued in the second quarter of 2009,
although some tentative signs of
stabilisation have begun to emerge.
reflecting the continued decline, the imf
in its july update of the world economic
outlook (weo) has projected that the
global economy will shrink by 1.4 per cent
in 2009, a shade more than the contraction
of 1.3 per cent projected earlier in april 2009.
the global economy is, however, projected
to recover and expand by 2.5 per cent in 2010
(table 1). projections by other international
agencies such as the world bank also do not
hold any promise of recovery in 2009.

table 1: global gdp growth (%)

7.
in the us, real gdp declined at an
annual rate of 5.5 per cent in q1 of 2009,
driven mainly by a decline in consumption
and exports. the imf’s july weo update

and concerted monetary measures by
developed economies have begun to show
results. global credit spreads have tended
to decline to levels prevailing prior to the
collapse of lehman brothers in september
2008. in the us, domestic money market
spreads have declined to around the
lowest points since the onset of the
financial crisis. the stress test results
for the 19 largest banks in the us and
the banks’ subsequent actions in raising
funds had a positive impact on financial
markets as evidenced by the decline in
the credit default swap (cds) spreads in
the period after the announcement of the
stress test results. however, sovereign
cds spreads remain above the pre-crisis
level reflecting concerns over rising
public debt levels.

retail sales and consumption continued to
be weak as households were still engaged in
repairing their balance sheets ruptured by
the fall in asset prices. the below trend
growth is likely to persist for some more
time. consequently, spare capacity and
unemployment are expected to rise.
8.
the outlook for the euro area is
worse than that for the us. real gdp in
the euro area declined by 4.9 per cent in
q1 of 2009 and unemployment rose to 9.5
per cent in may 2009. although measures
of consumer and business sentiment have
improved somewhat, signs of recovery have
been less evident than in the us. the july
weo update has projected real gdp of the
euro area to shrink by 4.8 per cent in 2009
and by 0.3 per cent in 2010. real gdp in
japan contracted by 14.2 per cent in the
quarter ended march 2009. however,
subsequent data suggest that output is
stabilising and consumer confidence is
improving. according to the july weo
update of the imf, the japanese economy
is projected to shrink by 6.0 per cent in 2009
before recovering by 1.7 per cent in 2010.

10.
in recent weeks, there have been
some indications of the negative growth
rates moderating in several countries.
overall, oecd’s composite leading
indicators point to an easing of the pace
of deterioration in some major economies,
especially canada, france, italy and the
uk. positive signals are also emerging in
the world’s three largest economies – the
us, japan and germany. in the us, most
of the manufacturing sector surveys
showed further improvement in june and
july, and the chicago pmi rose with new
orders and production indicating
improvement in business sentiment.
inventories at us wholesalers fell in may
for the ninth straight month accompanied
by an increase in sales. in japan, there has
been a strong recovery in the manufacturing
pmi as also a pick-up in export volumes,
after a precipitous fall in the late 2008 and
early 2009. while some analysts contend

9.
central banks across countries
have continued with an easy monetary
policy stance. among the central banks in
advanced countries, the european central
bank (ecb) reduced its policy rate in two
stages from 1.5 per cent in march 2009 to
1.0 per cent by may 2009 and also announced
a programme to purchase bonds. the
federal reserve, the bank of japan, the
bank of england and the swiss national bank
have continued with their unconventional
monetary policies, with policy rates in these
countries being in the range of 0 – 0.75 per
cent. the extraordinarily large, co-ordinated
3

domestic outlook

that these ‘green shoots’ signal the
beginning of a recovery, there is an
influential view that the signals are too
weak or fragile to indicate any sustainable
turnaround before the close of 2009.

12.
the indian economy grew by 6.7
per cent in 2008-09 according to the revised
estimates of the central statistical
organisation (cso) – better than most
analysts had expected, but lower than the
growth of 9.0 per cent in 2007-08. the
deceleration in gdp growth was particularly
pronounced during the second half of
2008-09, largely due to the adverse impact
of the global economic crisis (table 2).

emerging market economies
11.
in its july weo update, the imf
projects the gdp growth of emerging and
developing economies to decelerate to 1.5
per cent in 2009 from 6.0 per cent in 2008,
before expanding to 4.7 per cent in 2010.
the imf, however, upgraded the growth
outlook for developing asia citing
improved prospects in china and india. in
2009 so far (up to june 2009), industrial
production has picked up in a wide range
of asian economies. the most notable has
been the strong recovery in china’s
industrial production following the very
large increase in fixed capital investment
by the public sector and strong credit
growth. china has been able to at least
partly neutralise the impact of contraction
in exports by expanding domestic
demand, especially government investment
demand. industrial output in korea and
taiwan too has recorded a significant
upturn.

agriculture
13.
the agriculture sector, which
recorded an average annual growth rate of
4.9 per cent during 2003-08, expanded only
by 1.6 per cent during 2008-09. in 2008-09,
foodgrains production was 233.9 million
tonnes, up from 230.8 million tonnes last
year. this was also an all-time high. allied
activities – horticulture, floriculture,
forestry, livestock and fisheries – which
account for a substantial share in
agriculture remained buoyant. however,
the production of commercial crops such
as major oilseeds, cotton, jute and
sugarcane was lower. looking ahead to
the current year, the progress of the southwest monsoon has been slow and halting.

by july 22, 2009, monsoon rainfall was
19 per cent below normal in the country
as a whole. at a disaggregated level,
rainfall was deficient/scanty in 19 of the
36 meteorological sub-divisions. while
kharif sowing has picked up in july, the
delayed monsoon can impact agricultural
output. although the share of agriculture
and allied activities in gdp has declined
over the years and is currently at 17.5 per
cent, good agricultural performance is
critical not only because it employs over
55 per cent of the labour force but also
for ensuring stability in food prices.

industry

16.
india’s exports have contracted
during each of the last eight months
(october 2008-may 2009). however,
imports in q4 of 2008-09 contracted faster
than exports on account of moderation in
oil prices and reduction in non-oil imports.
as a result, growth of net exports
decelerated sharply. private final
consumption expenditure and gross fixed
capital formation, together with a weight
of nearly 90 per cent in gdp, decelerated
significantly in the second half of 2008-09.
however, a sharp increase in government
consumption in the second half of the year,
resulting from the sixth pay commission
payouts and fiscal stimulus measures,
cushioned the overall decline in aggregate
demand (table 3).

15.
the performance of the services
sector during april-may 2009 presents a
mixed but predictable picture. trade-related
services such as cargo handled at major
sea and airports, as also passengers handled
at international terminals continue to
show deceleration/negative growth.
domestic activity-related services such as
communication and construction are
showing signs of upturn.
demand components of gdp

14.
industrial sector growth decelerated
significantly to 2.6 per cent in 2008-09 from
8.5 per cent in the previous year due largely
to negligible/negative growth during four
months in the second half of the year. this
pushed down the growth rate of the index
of industrial production (iip) to an
abysmally low of 0.4 per cent during the
second half of 2008-09 from 5.0 per cent
in the first half. during april-may 2009,
however, industrial growth turned positive
with iip increasing by 1.9 per cent. while
growth in the basic, intermediate and
consumer durable goods sectors picked up,
the capital goods and consumer nondurable sectors showed negative growth.
the core infrastructure sector, with a weight
of 26.7 per cent in the iip, recorded a higher
growth of 4.8 per cent during april-june
2009, up from 3.5 per cent in the
corresponding period in the previous year.
the leading indicators of industrial
production, both quantitative and
qualitative, suggest that the recent
downturn has been arrested and a pick-up
is on the way forward, albeit with some lag.

17.
in fact, the contribution of
government final consumption expenditure
to gdp growth expanded four-fold from 8.0
per cent in 2007-08 to 32.5 per cent in
2008-09, while the share of private final
consumption expenditure nearly halved
from 53.8 per cent to 27.0 per cent during
the same period (table 4).

over q4 of 2008-09 with improved profit
margins.

corporate performance
18.
the performance of the private
non-financial corporate sector deteriorated
in the second half of 2008-09, reflecting
both demand slowdown and moderation in
prices (table 5). profit margins were eroded
by deceleration in sales, increased interest
outgo, significant drop in non-sales income
and losses on foreign currency related
transactions. early corporate results for q1
of 2009-10 indicate moderate sales growth

business confidence
19.
the industrial outlook survey of
the reserve bank, conducted during
april-may 2009, shows a turnaround in the
business sentiment. the assessment for q1
of 2009-10 suggests that the slide in
sentiment in the preceding three quarters
has been arrested on key indicators such as
production, order book position, capacity
utilisation, financial situation and
availability of finance.

improvement in capacity utilisation as also

inflation

2008 tracking the firm global commodity
prices. as the global commodity prices
moderated from their peak levels, domestic
prices also adjusted, setting off a converse
movement in wpi inflation. that volatility
in wpi flowed largely from international
commodity prices is evident from the trend
in wpi inflation excluding mineral oils and
metals (weight in wpi: 15.3 per cent),
which is less volatile than the overall wpi
inflation (chart 1).

21.
the headline inflation, as measured
by year-on-year variations in the wholesale
price index (wpi), decelerated from a peak
of 12.91 per cent on august 2, 2008 to 0.84
per cent at end-march 2009 and turned
negative in june 2009. the increased
volatility in wpi inflation needs to be seen
in the context of the behaviour of the global
commodity prices. reflecting the sharp
increase in oil and metal prices, wpi
inflation had risen to double digits in june
2008 and remained elevated till october

22.
wpi inflation for the week ended
july 11, 2009 was (-)1.17 per cent. the
negative wpi inflation is expected to persist
for a few more months till the base effect
wears off. the evolution of wpi inflation
so far has been along the lines anticipated
in the annual policy statement of april
2009. the currently observed negative wpi
inflation largely reflects the statistical effect
of the high base of last year and should not
be interpreted as structural deflation arising
from demand contraction.

while there is a moderation of investment
intentions in 2009-10 vis-à-vis 2008-09,
capital investments by big companies are
expected in food, rubber, paper and cement
groups. the overall findings of the reserve
bank’s industrial outlook survey are also
corroborated by business confidence
surveys conducted by other agencies such
as dun and bradstreet, and ficci.

corresponding period of the previous year.
various consumer price indices (cpis) are
also ruling at elevated levels. all these
would suggest that the negative year-onyear wpi inflation cannot be attributed to
structural deficiency in demand (table 6).

23.
at a disaggregated level, wpi
inflation, on account of food articles, is
ruling high and wpi inflation for essential
commodities (weight in wpi: 17.8 per
cent) is also in double digits. on a financial
year basis, wpi has already increased by
3.5 per cent in 2009-10 (up to july 11) as
against an increase of 5.6 per cent in the

due to the combined impact of the economic
slowdown and the fiscal stimulus
measures in terms of tax cuts to support
growth (table 7). on the other hand,
aggregate expenditure has increased mainly
on account of the implementation of the
sixth pay commission award, the debt
waiver scheme for farmers, the rural
employment programme and spending on
infrastructure.

pronounced in the recent period with the wpi
inflation turning negative, while the cpi
inflation is ruling in the range of 8.6-11.5
per cent. this is in contrast to the historical
trend when cpi inflation has tracked wpi
inflation, albeit with a lag, as wholesale
price changes are followed by retail price
changes. in recent months, cpi inflation has
remained stubborn at elevated levels due
to increased prices of food items, which
have a higher weight in the cpi basket than
in the wpi. as would be expected, cpi
inflation tracks the essential commodities
component of wpi inflation quite closely
(chart 2). the divergence in various price
indices evidently increases the complexity
of inflation assessment. for its overall
assessment of inflation outlook for policy
purposes, therefore, the reserve bank, as
always, monitors the full array of price
indicators.

26.
as a result of fiscal stimulus
measures, coupled with the reduction in the
tax-gdp ratio, all the deficit indicators
deteriorated sharply and deviated

owing to the fiscal stimulus
packages as also additional post-budget items
of expenditure, the combined net market
borrowings of the central and state
governments in 2008-09 were nearly two and
half times their net borrowings in 2007-08.
as per budget estimates, the combined net
borrowing requirements of the central and
state governments for 2009-10 are
estimated to be higher than the 2008-09
actual borrowings by as much as 34 per cent
(table 8).

significantly from the targets stipulated
under the fiscal responsibility and budget
management (frbm) rules. the fiscal
deficit increased from 2.7 per cent of gdp
in 2007-08 to 6.2 per cent (pre-actual) in
2008-09. of the increase in fiscal deficit due
to the stimulus measures (3.5 per cent of
gdp), a major portion (3.3 percentage
points) has been on account of increase in
expenditure. the revenue deficit also went
up from 1.1 per cent of gdp in 2007-08 to
4.6 per cent in 2008-09. the primary surplus
in 2007-08 turned into a deficit in 2008-09.

29.
the large government market
borrowing in 2009-10, as projected in the
interim budget, called for active liquidity
management by the reserve bank.
accordingly, the reserve bank indicated
its intention to purchase government
securities under open market operations
(omo) for an indicative amount of
rs.80,000 crore during the first half of
2009-10. considering the higher borrowing
programme indicated in the union budget

27.
the consolidated fiscal deficit of
the states for 2008-09 is expected to have
risen to 3.0 per cent of gdp taking the
estimated combined deficit of the centre
and the states to 9.1 per cent of gdp, a level
last seen in 2002-03. including the issuance
of bonds to oil marketing and fertiliser
companies, the combined deficit for
macroeconomic purposes adds up to around
10.9 per cent of gdp in 2008-09.

2009-10, the revised borrowing calendar for
q2 (july-september) of 2009-10 was
released on july 16, 2009. according to this
revised calendar, the net market borrowing
of the central government through dated
securities during the first half will be
rs.2,65,911 crore (higher by rs.58,000
crore from the interim budget).

government borrowing programme, which
increased from 8.42 per cent in q1 of
2008-09 to 9.24 per cent in q2, softened to
6.68 per cent in q4 of 2008-09. the weighted
average yield for the quarter ended june
2009 was, however, higher at 6.93 per cent.
the weighted average maturity of securities
issued during 2009-10 so far has been 11.5
years, shorter when compared with the
average maturity of 15.2 years last year.

30.
it may be noted that nearly 63
per cent (rs.1,67,911 crore) of the borrowing
programme for the first half of the year has
been completed by july 27, 2009. an
additional amount of rs.28,000 crore has
been raised through de-sequestering mss
balances. the open market operations
undertaken so far have been of the order of
rs.33,439 crore, accounting for about 42 per
cent of the notified amount of rs.80,000
crore. there is, therefore, sufficient
headroom available to the reserve bank to
manage the balance borrowing smoothly
(table 9).

monetary management since
mid-september 2008 has been guided by
the continued need to provide liquidity to
mitigate the impact of the global financial
crisis and to improve the growth prospects
in the medium-term. the reserve bank
continued with its commitment to ensure
comfortable domestic and foreign exchange
liquidity and endeavoured to complete the
large market borrowing programme of the
government in a non-disruptive manner.
accordingly, it provided foreign exchange
liquidity to contain the volatility in the
foreign exchange market, especially during
the first two anxious months (september-

in the transaction demand for currency and
reductions in the cash reserve ratio (crr)

significantly as on july 3, 2009 (y-o-y) in

october 2008). this led to a decline in the
reserve bank’s net foreign exchange assets
(nfea) and that was made up by an
expansion of net domestic assets (nda).
the reserve bank’s intervention helped in
maintaining orderly conditions in the
foreign exchange market and ensuring
overall comfortable liquidity in the system.
the phenomenon of substitution of foreign
assets by domestic assets, which began in
the second half of 2008-09, continued
during the first two months of the current
year. liquidity conditions have remained
comfortable since mid-november 2008
with the call money rate remaining near or
below the lower bound of the laf corridor,
consistent with the stance of monetary
policy. during 2009-10 (up to july 24,
2009), the average daily amount absorbed
by the reserve bank under the laf
window was rs.1,20,368 crore, suggesting
a large surplus with the banking system,
equivalent to nearly 3 per cent of net
demand and time liabilities (ndtl).

36.
as on july 3, 2009, the year-on-year
expansion in non-food credit was 16.3
per cent, lower than the growth of 25.5
per cent a year ago. the deceleration in the
overall credit flow has mainly been due to
subdued overall demand and lower credit
requirement of oil marketing companies.
while year-on-year growth in bank credit
by public sector banks was more than the
envisaged trajectory of 20 per cent
indicated in the annual policy statement
2009-10, credit expansion by private banks
was substantially lower, and credit
expansion by foreign banks was negative.
while the deposit growth of public sector
banks accelerated, that of private and foreign
bank groups decelerated (table 12).
37.
during the current financial year
(up to july 3, 2009), non-food credit
expanded by 0.4 per cent as compared with
1.6 per cent last year. it is not unusual for
non-food bank credit expansion to

decelerate in the early part of the year
due to seasonal factors. however, during
april-may 2009, non-food credit growth
turned negative mainly due to a sharp
decline in credit to petroleum and fertiliser
companies (decline of rs.18,796 crore in
contrast to an increase of rs.6,530 crore in
the same period of last year). during the
recent three fortnights of june 5, june 19
and july 3, 2009, non-food credit expansion
has been higher at rs.62,104 crore as
compared with an increase of rs.48,014
crore during the corresponding period of
2008.

39.
according to disaggregated data
drawn from 49 banks accounting for 95
per cent of total bank credit, the year-onyear growth in bank credit to industry as of
may 2009 was lower than that in the
previous year. while the credit flow to
agriculture, industry, real estate and nbfcs
was sustained, it was significantly lower for
housing (table 13).
total flow of financial resources to the
commercial sector
40.
during 2008-09, the total flow of
financial resources to the commercial sector
declined as compared with the previous
year, reflecting moderation in both bank
credit and funds from other sources. while
credit conditions have eased, the declining
trend continued through q1 of 2009-10,
reflecting subdued credit demand
conditions (table 14).

38.
as a result of the large deposit
expansion coupled with moderation in
credit demand, the scheduled commercial
banks’ investment in slr securities
(including securities acquired under the
laf) increased to 30.5 per cent of their
ndtl as on july 3, 2009 compared with
27.7 per cent a year ago. adjusted for laf,
their slr investments were at 26.9 per cent
of ndtl as on july 3, 2009. excess slr
investments, over the prescribed slr of 24
per cent of ndtl, were at rs.2,83,086 crore
as on july 3, 2009 (rs.1,26,431 crore
adjusted for laf).

the frequency distribution of

basis points. the crr was also reduced
by 400 basis points of ndtl of banks
(table 15).
42.
taking cues from the reduction in
the reserve bank’s policy rates and the
easy liquidity conditions, all public sector
banks, most private sector and foreign
banks have reduced their deposit and
lending rates. the reduction in term deposit
rates between october 2008 and july 20,
2009 has been in the range of 125-325 basis
points by public sector banks, 100-375 basis
points by private sector banks and 125-300
basis points by five major foreign banks.
the reduction in the range of bplrs was
125-275 basis points by public sector banks,
followed by 100-125 basis points by private
banks and 125 basis points by five major
foreign banks (table 16).

44.
the movement in the bplrs does
not fully and accurately reflect the
changes in effective lending rates as nearly
two-thirds of banks’ lending takes place at
sub-bplr rates. the reserve bank’s
discussions with banks reveal that ample
liquidity in the system and the subdued
demand for bank credit have increased the
competitive pressure on them to lend at
sub-bplr rates. rough estimates show that
the effective average lending rate for the
scheduled commercial banks has declined
from 12.3 per cent in march 2008 to 11.1

lending rate is expected to have declined
further in q1 of 2009-10. in effect, the

deepak mohanty) is examining the bplr

the secondary market yield on the

to 6.57 per cent in march 2009 and further
to 7.00 per cent in july 2009 on the back of
the large market borrowing programme of

bills and higher yields on longer tenor
government securities steepened the yield
curve (chart 3).

during 2009-10 so far, the

increased optimism regarding the indian

interest rate structure on small savings,
which constrains the reduction in deposit
rates; (ii) a substantial portion of bank
deposits is mobilised at fixed interest rates,
which discourages banks to reduce their
lending rates in line with the policy rates;
(iii) concessional lending rates linked to
bplrs for some sectors, which make
overall lending rates less flexible; and
(iv) persistence of the large market
borrowing programme of the government,
which hardens interest rate expectations.
as liquidity remains ample, the
competitive pressure on lending rates has
increased. consequently, the transmission
of policy rate changes to bank lending rates
has improved since the last annual policy
statement in april 2009. as the shortterm deposits contracted earlier at high
rates mature and get repriced, it opens up
room for banks to further reduce their
lending rates.

monetary transmission
49.
the efficacy of the monetary
transmission mechanism hinges on the
extent and speed with which changes in
the central bank’s policy rate are
transmitted through the term structure of
interest rates across markets. while the
transmission of policy rate changes by the
reserve bank has been faster in the money
and government securities markets, it has
been slow to the banks’ lending rates. this
has been a cause for concern. as indicated
in the annual policy statement, some of
the major factors that impede the
transmission of policy rates to the banks’
lending rates are: (i) the administered

moderation in international oil prices and
sustained invisible surplus. while capital
outflows persisted through q4 of 2008-09,
the trend reversed in q1 of 2009-10.

50.
during 2008-09, india’s current
account deficit widened to 2.6 per cent of
gdp from 1.5 per cent in 2007-08 reflecting
a deterioration in the trade balance. as net
capital inflows declined sharply from 9.2 per
cent of gdp in 2007-08 to 0.8
per cent in 2008-09, reserves declined by
us$ 20.1 billion, net of valuation changes,
and by us$ 58.0 billion, inclusive of
valuation changes (table 19). the stress was
maximum in q3 of 2008-09 as the
deteriorating current account balance was
accompanied by net capital outflows,
resulting in a substantial drawdown of
reserves. the current account position turned
around in q4 of 2008-09 reflecting sharp

51.
the overall approach to the
management of india’s foreign exchange
reserves takes into account the changing
composition of the balance of payments and
endeavours to reflect the ‘liquidity risks’
associated with different types of flows and
other requirements. in 2009-10 so far,
foreign exchange reserves have increased
by us$ 14.2 billion, taking them from
us$ 252.0 billion at end-march 2009 to
us$ 266.2 billion by july 17, 2009. the
increase has largely been on account of
valuation changes.

ii. stance of monetary policy
52.
the thrust of the various policy
initiatives by the reserve bank since
mid-september 2008 has been on providing
ample rupee liquidity, ensuring comfortable
dollar liquidity and maintaining a market
environment conducive for the continued
flow of credit to productive sectors. the
important measures initiated include
reduction of the repo and reverse repo rates,
reduction of the crr and the slr,
institution of several sector-specific liquidity
facilities, establishment of a forex swap
facility and relaxation in the guidelines for
raising external commercial borrowings
(ecbs). also, the reserve bank allowed
restructuring of stressed assets by banks in
order to increase the flow of credit for
productive purposes.

53.
in the annual policy statement of
april 2009, the reverse repo and repo rates
were reduced by 25 basis points each.
currently, the reverse repo rate is at 3.25
per cent and the repo rate is at 4.75 per cent.
these are at their historically lowest levels.
liquidity impact
54.
the actions of the reserve bank
since mid-september 2008 have resulted in
augmentation of actual/potential liquidity of
rs.5,61,700 crore (table 20). in addition, the
permanent reduction in the slr by one
per cent of ndtl has made liquid funds of
the order of rs.40,000 crore available for
credit expansion. analytically, the various
policy actions by the reserve bank since
mid-september 2008 have resulted in

declined significantly in tandem with the
call money rates. most commercial banks
have reduced their deposit and benchmark
prime lending rates. as the overall liquidity
conditions remain comfortable, the total
utilisation under the special refinance/
liquidity facilities made available by the
reserve bank has been low. however,
bankers have indicated that the existence
of these facilities – even if they have not
been fully tapped – has provided the much
needed comfort to them as a potential fall
back option.

expansion of its domestic assets, through
open market operations (omo) and
redemptions of bonds under the market
stabilisation scheme (mss), among others,
for creating base money to support the
required monetary expansion. liquidity
expansion has been consistent with the
reserve bank’s stance of ensuring a policy
regime that will enable credit expansion at
viable rates while preserving credit quality.
55.
the liquidity situation has remained
comfortable as evidenced by the laf
window being in an absorption mode since
mid-november 2008. during the current
financial year, the reserve bank has been
absorbing over rs.1,20,000 crore on average
daily basis under the laf window. call
money rates have generally been close to
or below the lower bound of the laf
corridor. other money market rates such as
those for cblo and market repo, and
discount rates of cds and cps, have also

56.
since the crisis intensified in
september 2008, the reserve bank has been
taking necessary actions in order to cushion
the economy from its worst impact. for this
purpose, the reserve bank used a variety of
instruments such as the repo and reverse repo
rates, cash reserve ratio, statutory liquidity
ratio, open market operations including the
liquidity adjustment facility, the market
20

stabilisation scheme, special market
operations and sector-specific liquidity
facilities. the reserve bank has also used
prudential tools to modulate the flow of
credit to certain sectors consistent with the
objective of financial stability. the reserve
bank will continue to rely on these
multiple instruments to modulate the
liquidity and interest rate conditions in line
with the evolving global and domestic
macroeconomic conditions.

industrial growth. also, the onset of the
south-west monsoon has been delayed and
it remains below normal, increasing the
downside risks to agricultural production.
on balance, an uptrend in the growth
momentum is unlikely before the middle of
2009-10. on current assessment, the growth
projection for gdp for 2009-10 is placed at
6.0 per cent with an upward bias. this
updated growth projection for 2009-10, thus,
marks a slight improvement over the growth
expectations of around 6.0 per cent indicated
in the annual policy statement.

growth projection
57.
in 2008-09, real gdp increased by
6.7 per cent, in line with the projection in
the reserve bank’s annual policy statement
of april 2009. however, the growth pattern
was uneven as real gdp growth decelerated
from 7.7 per cent in the first half of the year
to 5.8 per cent in the second half. this was
mainly because of the global financial
crisis, which affected external demand,
domestic private consumption and
investment demand. the overall
macroeconomic scenario continues to be
uncertain, although it is expected that the
fiscal and monetary stimulus measures will
boost domestic demand in 2009-10.

inflation projection
59.
headline wpi inflation turned
negative in june 2009 as anticipated in the
annual policy statement of april 2009.
however, negative wpi inflation in india is
due to the statistical base effect and, as
indicated in the april statement, it should
not be interpreted as a contraction in demand.
this transitory negative wpi inflation may
not persist beyond a few more months.
however, food price inflation continues to
remain elevated. this is reflected in
stubbornly high cpi inflation. the uncertain
monsoon outlook could further accentuate
food price inflation. moreover, the sharp
decline in wpi inflation has not been
commensurately matched by a similar
decline in inflation expectations.

58.
domestic and external financing
conditions are also now more favourable
than they were in the second half of 2008-09.
the business outlook has turned positive
signalling a revival of industrial activity. on
the other hand, keeping in view the sharp
contraction in world trade projected during
2009, export demand will continue to remain
weak. similarly, during the earlier part of
2009-10, the services sector may experience
the drag of sluggish external demand and
the lagged adverse impact of the weak

60.
pressures from global commodity
prices, which had been abating markedly
since august 2008 on account of the slump
in global demand, seem to have bottomed
out in early 2009. in fact, commodity
prices have rebounded ahead of global
recovery. the reserve bank’s inflation
expectations survey shows that while
21

financial year so far reflecting easy liquidity
conditions. the major source of m 3
expansion has been the large increase in
bank credit to the government, which also
included omo by the reserve bank, while
credit to the commercial sector decelerated.
the reserve bank remains committed to
providing ample liquidity for all productive
activities on a continuous basis. in this
context, it is important that the increased
government market borrowing programme
does not crowd out credit flow to the private
sector. as such, money supply will have to
be higher than envisaged in the annual
policy statement of april 2009. accordingly,
for policy purposes, money supply (m3)
growth for 2009-10 is placed at 18.0 per
cent, up from 17.0 per cent projected in the
annual policy statement. consistent with
this, aggregate deposits of scheduled
commercial banks are projected to grow by
19.0 per cent. the growth in adjusted nonfood credit, including investment in bonds/
debentures/shares of public sector
undertakings and private corporate sector
and cps, has been retained at 20.0 per cent
as in the annual policy statement. as
always, these numbers are provided as
indicative projections and not as targets.

inflation expectations remain well
anchored, a majority of the respondents
expect inflation to rise over the next three
months to one year.
61.
in the annual policy statement of
april 2009, wpi inflation at end-march 2010
was projected at around 4.0 per cent. on a
financial year basis, wpi inflation has
already increased by 3.5 per cent by july 11,
2009. the base effect, which is generating
the negative wpi inflation, is projected to
completely wear off by october 2009.
thereafter, the year-on-year wpi inflation
will creep up even without any major supply
shock. keeping in view the global trend in
commodity prices and the domestic
demand-supply balance, wpi inflation for
end-march 2010 is projected at around 5.0
per cent. this is higher than the projection
of 4.0 per cent made in the annual policy
statement of april 2009.
62.
as always, the reserve bank will
endeavour to ensure price stability and
anchor inflation expectations. towards this
objective, the reserve bank will continue
to take into account the behaviour of all the
price indices and their components. the
conduct of monetary policy will continue
to condition and contain perception of
inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent.
this will be in line with the medium-term
objective of 3.0 per cent inflation consistent
with india’s broader integration with the
global economy.

overall assessment
64.
at the global level, the financial
sector seems to be stabilising, but the real
sector continues to be in recession. in recent
months, there have been some positive
signals relating to consumer spending, credit
spreads and financing conditions. however,
the signals are too tentative and weak to
suggest any firm turnaround. both
households and firms are still in the process
of rebuilding their balance sheets ruptured

monetary projection
63.
during 2008-09, money supply
(m 3 ) increased by 18.6 per cent. the
year-on-year growth in m3 has remained
over 20.0 per cent throughout the current
22

performance of most other economies. the
growth projection for the current year of 6.0
per cent with an upward bias reflects the
absence of any firm signs of definite
recovery in the world economy. the
challenge for us is to return the economy to
the high growth rate of 9 per cent that we
averaged in the period 2005-08.
notwithstanding the temporary hiccups of
the crisis period, india is not a demand
constrained economy; it is a supply
constrained economy. the critical
requirement for accelerated growth is to raise
the level of investment, particularly in
infrastructure.

by the crisis. as such, despite some measured
optimism of a turnaround sooner than
expected, a firm recovery at the global level
is unlikely before 2010. this continued
uncertainty in the immediate outlook is
reflected in the downward revision of global
growth for 2009 by the imf from (-)1.3 per
cent made in april 2009 to (-)1.4 per cent in
july 2009.
65.
since the release of the april 2009
policy statement, there have been
progressive signs of recovery in india:
food stocks have increased; industrial
production has turned positive; corporate
performance has improved; business
confidence surveys are optimistic; leading
indicators show an upturn; interest rates
have declined; credit off-take has picked
up after may 2009; stock prices have
rebounded; the primary capital market has
witnessed some activity; and external
financing conditions have improved. on
the other hand, there are some negative
signs: delayed and deficient monsoon;
food price inflation; rebound in global
commodity prices; continuing weak
external demand; and high fiscal deficit.

68.
since the outbreak of the crisis in
mid-september 2008, the reserve bank has
maintained an accommodative monetary
stance. it will be the endeavour of the
reserve bank to maintain a policy stance
that will aid return of the economy to the
high growth path. at the same time, there
are factors – stubborn food price inflation,
rebound in world commodity prices,
expansionary monetary and fiscal policies
– that could potentially build inflationary
pressures. accordingly, the task of returning
the economy to a high growth path, viewed
from the current perspective, throws up some
important challenges. these are highlighted
below.

66.
on balance, the risks to the current
projections of real gdp growth and inflation
for 2009-10 are on the upside. the
comfortable levels of foodgrains stocks
should help mitigate the risks in the event
of price pressures from the supply side. the
reserve bank also will closely monitor the
level of liquidity so as to contain inflationary
expectations if supply side price pressures
were to rise.

69.
first, the immediate challenge for
the reserve bank is to manage the balance
between the short-term compulsions of
providing ample liquidity and the potential
build-up of inflationary pressure on the way
forward. as indicated earlier, the negative
wpi inflation numbers are only a statistical
feature and do not have any structural
significance. within wpi inflation, inflation
of primary articles, particularly food

2008-09 was better than most analysts had
expected, and decidedly better than the

articles, remains significantly positive.
even as inflation of manufactured products
is negative, inflation of manufactured food
products is close to double digits. moreover
consumer price indices (cpis) have
remained elevated, indeed also hardened in
recent months. the task for the reserve
bank is to maintain the accommodative
monetary stance till demand conditions
further improve and the credit flow takes
hold, but to be ready with a roadmap to
reverse the expansionary stance quickly and
effectively thereafter.

71.
by way of challenges, the third is
to spur private investment demand which has
been dented by the crisis. the growth of
gross fixed capital formation, with a weight
of nearly 32 per cent in the real gdp,
dropped from 12.9 per cent in 2007-08 to
8.2 per cent in 2008-09. accelerating this
ratio back to the pre-crisis level and indeed
improving on that is critical for sustainable
growth in the medium-term. of particular
importance is increased investment in
infrastructure. the reserve bank has
maintained a consistent stance of monetary
accommodation over the last nine months
in order to maintain a soft interest rate
regime. the banks have responded to the
monetary stance by reducing deposit and
lending rates, although there is scope for
further reduction. going forward, the
reserve bank will meet the challenge of
spurring private credit demand by
maintaining policy rates and liquidity
conditions conducive for revival of private
credit demand.

70.
the second challenge for the
reserve bank is to manage the
government’s borrowing programme for
2009-10. as indicated earlier, government
borrowing expanded very rapidly in 2008-09.
during the current year, the budgeted net
borrowing of the central government is 33
per cent higher than the already elevated
borrowing of last year. despite active
liquidity management by the reserve bank,
yields on government securities firmed up
from a low of 5.8 per cent in january 2009
to around 7.0 per cent in july 2009. the
hardening of yields has clearly militated
against the low interest rate regime that the
economy requires in the current situation.
private credit demand remains subdued as
of now, but is likely to pick up. in order to
manage the government borrowing without
crowding out present or potential private
credit demand, the reserve bank will
continue with its active liquidity
management policy. it may be noted in this
context that during the first half of 2009-10,
planned omo purchases and mss
unwinding will add primary liquidity of
rs.1,50,000 crore, which by way of

72.
shifting from the immediate to the
short-to-medium term, the fourth challenge
is fiscal consolidation. in order to make up
for the deceleration in private consumption
and investment demand, it was necessary for
the government to resort to countercyclical
public spending. this has, in a large way,
insulated the economy from the worst impact
of the crisis. the large and abrupt increase
in government borrowing has, however, led
to hardening of yields on government
securities which have impeded monetary
transmission. furthermore, large fiscal
deficits, if continued strictly beyond the
24

recovery period, can crowd out private
investment and trigger inflationary
pressures. the government will, therefore,
need to return to a path of fiscal
consolidation. this entails two facets on the
way forward. the first is to lay down the
roadmap for fiscal consolidation. this has
to go beyond merely indicating revised
frbm targets to giving out the details of
the adjustment that will take place on the
revenue and expenditure fronts. that will
lend credibility to the fiscal stance and also
give predictability to economic agents. the
second facet is to focus on the quality of
fiscal adjustment even while pursuing
quantitative targets.

policy stance
74.
on the basis of the above overall
assessment, the stance of monetary policy
for the remaining period of 2009-10 will be
as follows:

73.
finally, the big medium-term
challenge is to improve the investment
climate and expand the absorptive capacity
of the economy. development experience
clearly demonstrates that no country has
been able to sustain a high growth episode
without a sustained increase in investment
together with improvements in productivity.
this entails two tasks. the first is to move
on with financial sector reforms to promote
financial inclusion, further widen and
deepen financial markets and strengthen
financial institutions. in doing so, we will
inevitably have to factor in the lessons of
the global economic crisis. the second task
is a big thrust on governance reforms that
should inspire the trust and confidence of
potential investors.

•

manage liquidity actively so that the
credit demand of the government is met
while ensuring the flow of credit to the
private sector at viable rates.

•

keep a vigil on the trends and signals of
inflation, and be prepared to respond
quickly and effectively through policy
adjustments.

•

maintain a monetary and interest rate
regime consistent with price stability
and financial stability supportive of
returning the economy to the high
growth path.

75.
it is worth reiterating that the
reserve bank will maintain an
accommodative monetary stance until there
are definite and robust signs of recovery.
this accommodative monetary stance is,
however, not the steady state stance. on the
way forward, the reserve bank will have to
reverse the expansionary measures to anchor
inflation expectations and subdue
inflationary pressures while preserving the
growth momentum. the exit strategy will
be modulated in accordance with the
evolving macroeconomic developments.
