monetary policy statement, 2020-21
resolution of the monetary policy committee (mpc)
february 3-5, 2021
on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic
situation, the monetary policy committee (mpc) at its meeting today
(february 5, 2021) decided to:
•

keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (laf)
unchanged at 4.0 per cent.

consequently, the reverse repo rate under the laf remains unchanged at
3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (msf) rate and the bank rate at
4.25 per cent.
•

the mpc also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as
necessary – at least during the current financial year and into the next financial
year – to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of covid19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target
going forward.

these decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index (cpi) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of
+/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth.
the main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.
assessment
global economy
2.
the global economic recovery slackened in q4 (october-december) of 2020
relative to q3 (july-september) as several countries battle second waves of covid19 infections, including more virulent strains. with massive vaccination drives
underway, risks to the recovery may abate and economic activity is expected to gain
momentum in the second half of 2021. in its january 2021 update, the international
monetary fund (imf) has revised upward its estimate of global growth in 2020 to
(-)3.5 per cent from (-)4.4 per cent and increased the projection of global growth for
2021 by 30 basis points to 5.5 per cent. barring some emerging market economies,
inflation remains benign on weak aggregate demand, although rising commodity
prices carry upside risks. financial markets remain buoyant, supported by easy
monetary conditions, abundant liquidity and optimism from the vaccine rollout. global
trade is also expected to rebound in 2021, with services trade on a slower recovery
than merchandise trade.

2
domestic economy
3.
the first advance estimates of gdp for 2020-21 released by the national
statistical office (nso) on january 7, 2021 estimated real gdp to contract by
7.7 per cent, in line with the projection of (-)7.5 per cent set out in the december
2020 resolution of the mpc. high frequency indicators – railway freight traffic; toll
collection; e-way bills; and steel consumption – suggest that revival of some
constituents of the services sector gained traction in q3 (october-december). the
agriculture sector remains resilient - rabi sowing was higher by 2.9 per cent year-onyear (y-o-y) as on january 29, 2021, supported by above normal north-east monsoon
rainfall and adequate reservoir level of 61 per cent (as on february 4, 2021) of full
capacity, above the 10 years average of 50 per cent.
4.
after breaching the upper tolerance threshold of 6 per cent for six consecutive
months (june-november 2020), cpi inflation fell to 4.6 per cent in december on the
back of easing food prices and favourable base effects. food inflation collapsed to
3.9 per cent in december after averaging 9.6 per cent during the previous three
months (september-november) due to a sharp correction in vegetable prices and
softening of cereal prices with kharif harvest arrivals, alongside supply side
interventions. on the other hand, core inflation, i.e. cpi inflation excluding food and
fuel remained elevated at 5.5 per cent in december with marginal moderation from a
month ago. in the january 2021 round of the reserve bank’s survey, inflation
expectations of households softened further over a three month ahead horizon in
tandem with the moderation in food inflation; one year ahead inflation expectations,
however, remained unchanged.
5.
systemic liquidity remained in large surplus in december 2020 and january
2021, engendering easy financial conditions. reserve money rose by 14.5 per cent yo-y (on january 29, 2021), led by currency demand. money supply (m3), on the other
hand, grew by only 12.5 per cent as on january 15, 2021, but with non-food credit
growth of scheduled commercial banks accelerating to 6.4 per cent. corporate bond
issuances at ₹5.8 lakh crore during april-december 2020 were higher than ₹4.6 lakh
crore in the same period of last year. india’s foreign exchange reserves were at us$
590.2 billion on january 29, 2021 – an increase of us$ 112.4 billion over end-march
2020.
outlook
6.
with the larger than anticipated deflation in vegetable prices in december
bringing down headline closer to the target, it is likely that the food inflation trajectory
will shape the near-term outlook. the bumper kharif crop, rising prospects of a good
rabi harvest, larger winter arrivals of key vegetables and softer egg and poultry
demand on avian flu fears are factors auguring a benign inflation outcome in the
months ahead. on the other hand, price pressures may persist in respect of pulses,
edible oils, spices and non-alcoholic beverages. the outlook for core inflation is likely
to be impacted by further easing in supply chains; however, broad-based escalation
in cost-push pressures in services and manufacturing prices due to increase in
industrial raw material prices could impart upward pressure. furthermore, there could
be increased pass-through to output prices as demand normalises as indicated in the
reserve bank’s industrial outlook, services and infrastructure outlook surveys and
purchasing managers’ indices (pmis) and firms regain pricing power. international
crude oil prices may remain supported by demand build up on optimism from
vaccination and continuing production cuts by opec plus. the crude oil futures curve
has become downward sloping since december 2020. taking into consideration all

3
these factors, the projection for cpi inflation has been revised to 5.2 per cent in
q4:2020-21, 5.2 per cent to 5.0 per cent in h1:2021-22 and 4.3 per cent in q3: 202122, with risks broadly balanced (chart 1).
7.
turning to the growth outlook, rural demand is likely to remain resilient on
good prospects of agriculture. urban demand and demand for contact-intensive
services is expected to strengthen with the substantial fall in covid-19 cases and
the spread of vaccination. consumer confidence is reviving and business
expectations of manufacturing, services and infrastructure remain upbeat. the fiscal
stimulus under atmanirbhar 2.0 and 3.0 schemes of government will likely accelerate
public investment, although private investment remains sluggish amidst still low
capacity utilisation. the union budget 2021-22, with its thrust on sectors such as
health and well-being, infrastructure, innovation and research, among others, should
help accelerate the growth momentum. taking these factors into consideration, real
gdp growth is projected at 10.5 per cent in 2021-22 – in the range of 26.2 to 8.3 per
cent in h1 and 6.0 per cent in q3 (chart 2).

8.
the mpc notes that the sharp correction in food prices has improved the food
price outlook, but some pressures persist, and core inflation remains elevated. pump
prices of petrol and diesel have reached historical highs. an unwinding of taxes on
petroleum products by both the centre and the states could ease the cost push
pressures. what is needed at this point is to create conditions that result in a durable
disinflation. this is contingent also on proactive supply side measures. growth is
recovering, and the outlook has improved significantly with the rollout of the vaccine
programme in the country. the union budget 2021-22 has introduced several
measures to provide an impetus to growth. the projected increase in capital
expenditure augurs well for capacity creation thereby improving the prospects for
growth and building credibility around the quality of expenditure. the recovery,
however, is still to gather firm traction and hence continued policy support is crucial.
taking these developments into consideration, the mpc in its meeting today decided
to continue with an accommodative stance of monetary policy till the prospects of a
sustained recovery are well secured while closely monitoring the evolving outlook for
inflation.
