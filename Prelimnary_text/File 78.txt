first bi-monthly monetary policy statement, 2019-20
resolution of the monetary policy committee (mpc)
reserve bank of india
on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the
monetary policy committee (mpc) at its meeting today decided to:
•

reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (laf) by 25 basis points
to 6.0 per cent from 6.25 per cent with immediate effect.

consequently, the reverse repo rate under the laf stands adjusted to 5.75 per cent, and the marginal
standing facility (msf) rate and the bank rate to 6.25 per cent.
the mpc also decided to maintain the neutral monetary policy stance.
these decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for
consumer price index (cpi) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting
growth.
the main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.
assessment
global economy
2.
since the last mpc meeting in february 2019, global economic activity has been losing pace.
in the us, the subdued performance in the final quarter of 2018 appears to have continued into
q1:2019 as reflected in declining factory activity. the euro area slowed down in q4:2018 on soft
domestic demand and contracting manufacturing activity. of its constituents, the italian economy
contracted for two consecutive quarters in q3 and q4. in the uk, growth slowed down on brexit
uncertainty, with industrial production contracting during september-january. the japanese
economy rebounded in q4 on increased domestic consumption expenditure and recovering
investment spending. however, the latest data on manufacturing activity and business confidence
suggest that growth lost momentum in q1:2019. the monetary policy stances of the us fed and
central banks in other major advanced economies (aes) have turned dovish.
3.
economic activity also slowed down in some major emerging market economies (emes).
the chinese economy decelerated in q4:2018 on subdued domestic and global demand impacting
industrial activity. much of this weakness seems to have continued into 2019 as reflected in low
1

factory output in q1, though the purchasing managers’ index (pmi) moved into expansion zone in
march after three months of contraction. in q1, the russian economy continued to be impacted by
both domestic and external headwinds. the brazilian economy ended 2018 on a weak note; going
into 2019, available economic indicators for q1 suggest that economic activity remained restrained
by both weak domestic and external demand. the south african economy slowed down in the final
quarter of 2018. subdued industrial activity and worsening external demand point to a further loss in
momentum in q1.
4.
crude oil prices have risen on production cuts by opec and russia as well as disruption in
supplies due to us sanctions on exports from venezuela. gold prices weakened on expectations of
positive outcomes of the china-us trade deal. inflation continued to remain low in major aes and
many key emes due to slowing global growth and stable or falling commodity prices.
5.
financial markets continued to be driven by monetary policy stances of key central banks and
movements in crude oil prices. in the us, the equity market witnessed some selling pressure in the
last week of march on weak economic data. equity markets in emes gained, benefitting from
country-specific factors and easing of global financing conditions. bond yields in the us softened,
slipped into negative territory in germany and dipped further into negative territory in japan as
central banks signalled softer stances. bond yields in most emes have been falling in tandem with
those in aes and on the improving inflation outlook. in currency markets, the us dollar has traded
with an appreciating bias in recent weeks. eme currencies have traded with a depreciating bias on
country-specific factors and on fears of a weakening economic outlook in china.
domestic economy
6.
turning to the domestic economy, the second advance estimates for 2018-19 released by the
central statistics office (cso) in february 2019 revised india’s real gross domestic product (gdp)
growth downwards to 7.0 per cent from 7.2 per cent in the first advance estimates. domestic
economic activity decelerated for the third consecutive quarter in q3:2018-19 due to a slowdown in
consumption, both public and private. however, gross fixed capital formation (gfcf) growth
remained in double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter in q3, with the gfcf to gdp ratio rising
to 33.1 per cent in q3:2018-19 against 31.8 per cent in q3:2017-18, supported primarily by the
government’s thrust on the road sector and affordable housing. the drag on aggregate demand from
net exports also moderated in q3 due to a marginal acceleration in exports and a sharp deceleration
in imports led by a decline in crude oil prices.
7.
on the supply side, the second advance estimates of the cso placed the growth of real gross
value added (gva) lower at 6.8 per cent in 2018-19 as compared with 6.9 per cent in 2017-18. gva
growth slowed down to 6.3 per cent in q3 due to a deceleration in agriculture output from the record
level achieved in the previous year. industrial gva growth remained unchanged in q3, with
manufacturing gva growth slowing somewhat. services gva growth also remained unchanged in
q3; while growth in construction activity accelerated, there was some loss of momentum in public
administration, defence and other services.
8.
beyond q3, the second advance estimates of foodgrains production for 2018-19 at 281.4
million tonnes were 1.2 per cent lower than the fourth advance estimates of 2017-18, but 1.4 per cent
higher than the second advance estimates of 2017-18. according to the national oceanic and
atmospheric administration (noaa) of the us, el niño conditions strengthened during february
2019, which may affect the prospects of a normal south west monsoon.
9.
of the high frequency indicators of industry, the manufacturing component of the index of
industrial production (iip) growth slowed down to 1.3 per cent in january 2019 due to automobiles,
pharmaceuticals, and machinery and equipment. the growth of eight core industries remained
2

sluggish in february. credit flows to micro and small as well as medium industries remained tepid,
though they improved for large industries. capacity utilisation (cu) in the manufacturing sector,
however, as measured by the reserve bank’s order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey
(obicus), improved to 75.9 per cent in q3 from 74.8 per cent in q2 exceeding its long-term
average; the seasonally adjusted cu rose to 76.1 per cent from 75.4 per cent. the business
assessment index of the industrial outlook survey (ios) points to an improvement in overall
sentiments in q4. the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (pmi) remained in expansion zone
for 20th month in march. the key indicators of investment activity contracted, viz., production of
capital goods in january and imports of capital goods in february.
10.
high frequency indicators of the services sector suggest significant moderation in activity.
sales of commercial vehicles contracted during february. other indicators of the transportation
sector, viz., port freight traffic and international air freight traffic, also contracted. however,
indicators of the construction sector, viz., consumption of steel and production of cement, continued
to show healthy growth. the hotels sub-segment showed some improvement in foreign tourist
arrivals in january and international air passenger traffic in february. the services pmi continued to
be in expansion zone for the tenth consecutive month in march 2019.
11.
retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the cpi, rose to 2.6 per cent in february after
four months of continuous decline. the uptick in inflation was driven by an increase in prices of
items excluding food and fuel and weaker momentum of deflation in the food group. however,
inflation in the fuel group collapsed to its lowest print in the new all india cpi series.
12.
within the food group, deflation in four sub-groups – vegetables, sugar, pulses and fruits –
continued in february. egg prices moved into inflation after remaining in deflation in previous three
months, while inflation ticked up in all other food sub-groups.
13.
inflation in the fuel and light sub-group collapsed from 4.5 per cent in december to 1.2 per
cent in february. prices of liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) declined sharply, pulled down by the
lagged impact of the softening of international energy prices. the prices of firewood, with the second
largest weight in the fuel group, also declined. electricity slipped into deflation in january and
february. inflation in kerosene remained elevated, however, reflecting the impact of the calibrated
increase in its administered price.
14.
cpi inflation excluding food and fuel declined to 5.2 per cent in january, but rose to 5.4 per
cent in february, driven by a broad-based pick-up in inflation in the personal care and effects, and
recreation and amusement sub-groups. however, inflation in the clothing and footwear, and transport
and communication sub-groups fell, the latter reflecting the reduction in petrol and diesel prices.
inflation in the health and education sub-groups remained elevated, even though it moderated
markedly during january-february vis-à-vis december.
15.
inflation expectations, measured by the reserve bank’s survey of households, declined in the
february round over the previous round by 40 basis points each for the three months ahead and for
the one year ahead horizons. firms participating in the reserve bank’s industrial outlook survey of
manufacturing companies reported reduction in input price pressures, but they expected an increase
in staff expenses in q1:2019-20. farm and industrial input costs increased at a slow pace in januaryfebruary 2019. nominal growth in rural wages and staff costs in the organised manufacturing and
services sectors remained muted in q3:2018-19.
from a daily net average surplus of ₹27,928 crore (₹279 billion) during february 1-6, 2019,
systemic liquidity moved into deficit during february 7 - march 31, reflecting the build-up of
government cash balances. currency in circulation expanded sharply in february-march. the
16.

3

liquidity needs of the system were met through injection of durable liquidity amounting to ₹37,500
crore (₹375 billion) in february and ₹25,000 crore (₹250 billion) in march through open market
purchase operations (omos). consequently, total durable liquidity injected by the reserve bank
through omos aggregated ₹2,98,500 crore (₹2,985 billion) for 2018-19. liquidity injected under the
laf, on an average daily net basis, was ₹95,003 crore (₹950 billion) during february (february 728, 2019) and ₹57,043 crore (₹570 billion) in march. the weighted average call rate (wacr)
remained broadly aligned with the policy repo rate in february and march.
anticipating the seasonal tightening of liquidity at end-march, the reserve bank conducted
four longer term (tenor ranging between 14-day and 56-day) variable rate repo auctions during the
month in addition to the regular 14-day variable rate term repo auctions. furthermore, the reserve
bank conducted long-term foreign exchange buy/sell swaps of us$ 5 billion for a tenor of 3 years on
march 26, 2019, thereby injecting durable liquidity of ₹34,561 crore (₹346 billion) into the system.
17.

18.
export growth remained weak in january and february 2019 mainly due to exports of
petroleum products decelerating in response to a fall in international crude oil prices. among non-oil
exports, engineering goods, chemicals, leather and marine products recorded either sequentially
lower or negative growth. as in the case of exports, lower international crude oil prices downsized
the oil import bill. non-oil non-gold imports declined sharply, dragged down by the subdued demand
for pearls and precious stones, transport equipment, project goods and vegetable oils. the trade
deficit narrowed in february 2019 – both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis – to its lowest
level in 17 months. this, along with the increase in services exports and lower outgo of income
payments, resulted in narrowing of the current account deficit sequentially. on the financing side, net
fdi inflows were strong in april-january 2018-19. foreign portfolio investors turned net buyers in
the domestic capital market in q4:2018-19. india’s foreign exchange reserves were at us$ 412.9
billion on march 31, 2019.
outlook
19.
in the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of february 2019, cpi inflation was
projected at 2.8 per cent for q4:2018-19, 3.2-3.4 per cent for h1:2019-20 and 3.9 per cent for
q3:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced around the central trajectory. actual inflation outcomes
averaged 2.3 per cent in january-february.
20.
the inflation path during 2019-20 is likely to be shaped by several factors. first, low food
inflation during january-february will have a bearing on the near-term inflation outlook. second, the
fall in the fuel group inflation witnessed at the time of the february policy has become accentuated.
third, cpi inflation excluding food and fuel in february was lower than expected, which has
imparted some downward bias to headline inflation. fourth, international crude oil prices have
increased by around 10 per cent since the last policy. fifth, inflation expectations of households as
well as input and output price expectations of producers polled in the reserve bank’s surveys have
further moderated. taking into consideration these factors and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019,
the path of cpi inflation is revised downwards to 2.4 per cent in q4:2018-19, 2.9-3.0 per cent in
h1:2019-20 and 3.5-3.8 per cent in h2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced.
21.
gdp growth for 2019-20 in the february policy was projected at 7.4 per cent in the range of
7.2-7.4 per cent in h1, and 7.5 per cent in q3 – with risks evenly balanced. since then, there are
some signs of domestic investment activity weakening as reflected in a slowdown in production and
imports of capital goods. the moderation of growth in the global economy might impact india’s
exports. on the positive side, however, higher financial flows to the commercial sector augur well
for economic activity. private consumption, which has remained resilient, is also expected to get a
fillip from public spending in rural areas and an increase in disposable incomes of households due to
tax benefits. business expectations continue to be optimistic. taking into consideration the above
4

factors, gdp growth for 2019-20 is projected at 7.2 per cent – in the range of 6.8-7.1 per cent in
h1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in h2 – with risks evenly balanced.

22.
beyond the near term, several uncertainties cloud the inflation outlook. first, with the
domestic and global demand-supply balance of key food items expected to remain favourable, the
short-term outlook for food inflation remains benign. however, early reports suggest some
probability of el niño effects in 2019. there is also the risk of an abrupt reversal in vegetable prices,
especially during the summer months. second, inflation in fuel group items, particularly electricity,
firewood and chips saw unprecedented softening in h2:2018-19. there is, however, uncertainty
about the sustainability of this softening in inflation in fuel items. third, the outlook for oil prices
continues to be hazy, both on the upside and the downside. on the one hand, continuing opec
production cuts will reduce supplies. on the other hand, there is considerable uncertainty about
demand conditions. should there be a swift resolution of trade tensions, a pick-up in global demand
is likely to push up oil prices. however, should trade tensions linger and demand conditions worsen,
crude prices may fall from current levels, despite production cuts by opec. fourth, inflation
excluding food and fuel has remained elevated over the past twelve months with some pick up in
prices in february. however, should the recent slowdown in domestic economic activity accentuate,
it may have a bearing on the outlook for inflation in this category. fifth, financial markets remain
volatile reflecting in part global growth and trade uncertainty, which may have an influence on the
inflation outlook. sixth, the fiscal situation at the general government level requires careful
monitoring.
23.
the mpc notes that the output gap remains negative and the domestic economy is facing
headwinds, especially on the global front. the need is to strengthen domestic growth impulses by
spurring private investment which has remained sluggish.
24.
against this backdrop, the mpc decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and
maintain the neutral stance of monetary policy.
25.
dr. pami dua, dr. ravindra h. dholakia, dr. michael debabrata patra and shri shaktikanta
das voted in favour of the decision to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. dr. chetan
ghate and dr. viral v. acharya voted to keep the policy rate unchanged.
