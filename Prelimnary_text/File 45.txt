monetary policy statement 2013-14
by
dr. d. subbarao
governor
introduction

hamstrung by supply bottlenecks and
sluggish external demand. most lead
indicators suggest a slow recovery
through 2013-14. inflation eased
significantly in q4 of 2012-13 although
upside pressures remain, both at
wholesale and retail levels, stemming
from elevated food inflation and ongoing
administered fuel price revisions. the
main risks to the outlook are the still high
twin deficits accentuated by the
vulnerability to sudden stop and reversal
of capital flows, inhibited investment
sentiment and tightening supply
constraints, particularly in the food and
infrastructure sectors.

the annual policy for 2013-14 is
formulated in an environment of incipient
signs of stabilisation in the global
economy and prospects of a turnaround,
albeit modest, in the domestic economy.
2.
in the advanced economies
(aes), near-term risks have receded,
aided by improving financial conditions
and supportive macroeconomic policies.
but this improvement is yet to fully
transmit to economic activity which
remains sluggish. policy implementation
risks and uncertainty about outcomes
continue to threaten the prospects of a
sustained recovery. emerging and
developing economies (edes) are in the
process of a multi-speed recovery.
however, weak external demand and
domestic bottlenecks continue to restrain
investment in some of the major emerging
economies. inflation risks appear
contained, reflecting negative output
gaps and the recent softening of
international crude and food prices.

4.
this statement, set in the above
global and domestic context, should be
read and understood together with the
detailed review in macroeconomic and
monetary developments released
yesterday by the reserve bank.
5.
this statement is organised in
two parts. part a covers monetary policy
and is divided into four sections:
section i provides an overview of global
and domestic macroeconomic

3.
domestically, growth slowed
much more than anticipated, with both
manufacturing and services activity
1

developments; section ii sets out the
outlook and projections for growth,
inflation and monetary aggregates;
section iii explains the stance of
monetary policy; and section iv
specifies the monetary measures. part b
covers developmental and regulatory

policies and is organised into five
sections: financial stability (section i);
financial markets (section ii); credit
delivery and financial inclusion
(section iii); regulatory and supervisory
measures (section iv) and institutional
developments (section v).

part a. monetary policy
i. the state of the economy
global economy

as domestic demand rose on a turnaround
in the inventory cycle and some pick-up
in investment. among brics countries,
growth accelerated in brazil and south
africa, while it persisted below trend in
china, russia and india.

6.
global economic activity remains
subdued amidst signs of diverging
growth paths across major economies.
in the us, a slow recovery is taking hold,
driven by improvements in the housing
sector and employment conditions.
however, the pace of recovery remains
vulnerable to the adverse impact of the
budget sequestration which will gradually
gain pace in the months ahead. japan’s
economy stopped contracting in q4 of
2012. there has been some improvement
in consumer confidence on account of
monetary and fiscal stimulus along with
a pick-up in external demand on the back
of a weakening yen. in the euro area,
recessionary conditions, characterised by
deterioration in industrial production,
weak exports and low domestic demand,
continued into q1 of 2013. high
unemployment, fiscal drag and hesitant
progress on financial sector repair have
eroded consumer confidence.

8.
inflation has remained benign in
the aes in the absence of demand
pressures, and inflation expectations
remain well-anchored. the edes, on the
other hand, present a mixed picture.
while inflation has picked up in brazil,
russia and turkey, it has eased in china,
korea, thailand and chile.
9.
reflecting a pessimistic demand
outlook, crude oil prices eased in marchapril 2013 from the elevated levels
prevailing through 2012. non-energy
commodity prices have been easing
through q1 of 2013 on softening metal
prices and decline in food prices.
domestic economy
10.
with output expansion of only 4.5
per cent in q3 of 2012-13, the lowest in
15 quarters, cumulative gdp growth for

7.
growth in several edes
rebounded from the moderation in 2012
2

the period april-december 2012 declined
to 5.0 per cent from 6.6 per cent a year
ago. this was mainly due to the protracted
weakness in industrial activity aggravated
by domestic supply bottlenecks, and
slowdown in the services sector reflecting
weak external demand. the central
statistics office (cso)’s advance
estimate of gdp growth for 2012-13 of
5.0 per cent implies that the economy
would have expanded by 4.7 per cent in
q4.

(pmi), which encompasses
manufacturing and services, fell to a
17-month low in march 2013. thus,
most recent indicators suggest that
growth in q4 of 2012-13 would have
remained low.
12.
on the demand side, the
persisting decline in capital goods
production during april 2012 –
february 2013 reflects depressed
investment conditions. the moderation
in corporate sales and weakening
consumer confidence suggest that the
slowdown could be spreading to
consumption spending.

11.
the growth of industrial
production slid to 0.6 per cent in february
2013 from 2.4 per cent a month ago,
mainly due to contraction in mining and
electricity generation and slowing
growth in manufacturing. consequently,
on a cumulative basis, growth in
industrial production decelerated to 0.9
per cent during 2012-13 (april-february)
from 3.5 per cent in the corresponding
period of the previous year. the reserve
bank’s order books, inventories and
capacity utilisation survey (obicus)
suggests that capacity utilisation
remained flat. rabi production,
particularly of pulses, is expected to be
better than a year ago. however, it may
not fully offset the decline in kharif
output. consequently, the second
advance estimates of crop production
(kharif and rabi) for 2012-13 indicate a
decline of 3.5 per cent in relation to the
final estimates of the previous year. the
composite purchasing managers’ index

13.
headline inflation, as measured
by the wholesale price index (wpi),
moderated to an average of 7.3 per cent
in 2012-13 from 8.9 per cent in the
previous year. the easing was particularly
significant in q4 of 2012-13, with the
year-end inflation recording at 6.0 per
cent. notwithstanding the moderation in
overall inflation, elevated food price
inflation was a source of upside pressure
through the year owing to the unusual
spike in vegetable prices in april 2012
followed by rise in cereal prices on
account of the delayed monsoon and the
sharp increase in the minimum support
price (msp) for paddy. fuel inflation
averaged in double digits during 201213, largely reflecting upward revisions
in administered prices and the passthrough of high international crude
prices to freely priced items. non-food
3

manufactured products inflation ruled
above the comfort level in the first half
of 2012-13 but declined in the second
half to come down to 3.5 per cent by
march, reflecting easing of input price
pressures and erosion of pricing power.

early results of corporate performance
in q4 indicate continuing moderation in
sales though profit margins increased
slightly.
17.
money supply (m3) growth was
around 14.0 per cent during q1 of 201213 but decelerated thereafter to 11.2 per
cent by end-december as time deposit
growth slowed down. there was some
pick up in deposit mobilisation in q4,
taking deposit growth to 14.3 per cent by
end-march. consequently, m3 growth
reached 13.3 per cent by end-march
2013, slightly above the revised indicative
trajectory of 13.0 per cent.

14.
largely driven by food inflation,
retail inflation, as measured by the new
combined (rural and urban) consumer
price index (cpi) (base: 2010=100),
averaged 10.2 per cent during 2012-13.
even after excluding food and fuel
groups, cpi inflation remained sticky,
averaging 8.7 per cent. other cpis also
posted double digit inflation.
15.
s i g n i f i c a n t l y, i n f l a t i o n
expectations polled by the reserve
bank’s urban households’ survey,
showed slight moderation in q4 of 201213, even as they remained in double
digits, reflecting high food prices. wage
inflation in rural areas, which rose by an
average of close to 20 per cent over the
period april 2009 to october 2012,
declined modestly to 17.4 per cent in
january 2013. house price inflation, as
measured by the reserve bank’s
quarterly house price index, continued
to rise on a y-o-y basis.

18.
non-food credit growth
decelerated from 18.2 per cent at the
beginning of 2012-13 and remained
close to 16.0 per cent for the major part
of the year. by march 2013, non-food
credit growth dropped to 14.0 per cent,
lower than the indicative projection of
16.0 per cent, reflecting some risk
aversion and muted demand. while the
reserve bank’s credit conditions survey
showed easing of overall credit
conditions, there was some tightening
for sectors such as metals, construction,
infrastructure, commercial real estate,
chemicals and finance in q4 of 2012-13.

16.
an analysis of corporate
performance during q3 of 2012-13,
based on a common sample of 2,473
non-government non-financial
companies, indicates that growth of sales
as well as profits decelerated significantly.

19.
the total flow of resources to the
commercial sector from banks, nonbanks and external sources was higher
at `12.8 trillion in 2012-13 as compared
with `11.6 trillion in the previous year.
4

this increase was accounted for by
higher non-slr investment by scheduled
commercial banks (scbs), increase in
credit flow from nbfcs, gross private
placement and public issues by nonfinancial entities, and higher recourse to
short-term credit from abroad and
external commercial borrowings.

cumulatively by 75 bps on three occasions
and the statutory liquidity ratio (slr) by
100 bps during the year. additionally, the
reserve bank injected liquidity to the
tune of `1,546 billion through open
market operation (omo) purchase
auctions. the net injection of liquidity
under the laf, which peaked at `1,808
billion on march 28, 2013 reflecting the
year-end demand, reversed sharply to
`842 billion by end-april 2013.

20.
in consonance with the cuts in the
policy repo rate and the cash reserve ratio
(crr) during 2012-13, the modal term
deposit rate declined by 11 basis points
(bps) and the modal base rate by 50 bps.
while the decline in the term deposit rate
occurred mostly during the first half, the
modal base rate softened by 50 bps to
10.25 per cent in two steps of 25 bps each
during q1 and q4 of 2012-13. during
q4, 39 banks reduced their base rates in
the range of 5-75 bps. the weighted
average lending rate of banks declined
by 36 bps to 12.17 per cent during 201213 (up to february).

22.
the revised estimates (re) of
central government finances for 2012-13
show that the gross fiscal deficit-gdp
ratio at 5.2 per cent was around the
budgeted level and within the target set
out in the revised roadmap. budget
estimates (be) for 2013-14 place the
gross fiscal deficit-gdp ratio at 4.8 per
cent. the envisaged correction is
expected to be achieved through a
reduction of 0.6 percentage points in the
revenue deficit-gdp ratio.
23.
on the back of the policy rate
reduction and the announcement of a
slew of reform measures by the
government and a firm commitment to
fiscal consolidation, the 10-year
benchmark yield eased from 8.79 per
cent on april 3, 2012 to 7.79 per cent on
april 30, 2013.

21.
liquidity remained under pressure
throughout the year because of
persistently high government cash
balances with the reserve bank and
elevated incremental credit to deposit
ratio for much of the year. the net
average liquidity injection under the
daily liquidity adjustment facility (laf),
at `730 billion during the first half of the
year, increased significantly to `1,012
billion during the second half. in order
to alleviate liquidity pressures, the
reserve bank lowered the crr of scbs

24.
the current account deficit
(cad) came in at an all-time high of 6.7
per cent of gdp in q3 of 2012-13. there
are indications that it may have narrowed
in q4. the narrowing was largely on
5

account of the trade deficit declining,
with exports returning to positive growth
after contracting in the first three quarters
and non-oil non-gold imports and gold

imports declining. even as the cad
expanded, the surge in capital inflows in
the second half of the year ensured that
it could be fully financed.

ii. domestic outlook and projections
growth

of the year. conditional upon a normal
monsoon, agricultural growth could
return to trend levels. the outlook for
industrial activity remains subdued, with
the pipeline of new investment drying up
and existing projects stalled by
bottlenecks and implementation gaps.
with global growth unlikely to improve
significantly from 2012, growth in
services and exports may remain
sluggish. accordingly, the baseline gdp
growth for 2013-14 is projected at 5.7
per cent (chart 1).

25.
for gdp growth during 2012-13,
the cso’s advance estimate of 5.0 per
cent is lower than the reserve bank’s
baseline projection of 5.5 per cent set out
in the third quarter review (tqr) of
january 2013, reflecting slower than
expected growth in both industry and
services.
26.
during 2013-14, economic
activity is expected to show only a
modest improvement over last year, with
a pick-up likely only in the second half

6

inflation

timing and magnitude of administered
price revisions, particularly of electricity
and coal, will impact the evolution of the
trajectory of inflation in 2013-14.

27.
by march 2013, wpi inflation at
6.0 per cent turned out to be lower than
the reserve bank’s indicative projection
of 6.8 per cent, mainly due to a sharp
deceleration in non-food manufactured
products inflation in the second half of
the year. the global inflation outlook for
the current year appears more benign
compared to last year on expectations of
some softening of crude oil and food
prices. accordingly, imported inflation
is likely to be lower provided the
exchange rate remains broadly stable.
indicators of corporate performance,
industrial outlook and pmis are pointing
to a declining pricing power. on the other
hand, food inflation is likely to be a
source of upside pressure because of
persisting supply imbalances. also, the

28.
keeping in view the domestic
demand-supply balance, the outlook for
global commodity prices and the forecast
of a normal monsoon, wpi inflation is
expected to be range-bound around 5.5
per cent during 2013-14, with some
edging down in the first half on account
of past policy actions, although there
could be some increase in the second
half, largely reflecting base effects
(chart 2).
29.
it is critical to consolidate and
build upon the recent gains in containing
inflation. accordingly, the reserve bank
will endeavour to condition the evolution
of inflation to a level of 5.0 per cent by

7

risk factors

march 2014, using all instruments at its
command.

32.
the macroeconomic outlook for
2013-14 is subject to a number of risks
as indicated below.

30.
it is important to re-emphasise
that although the most recent episode of
high and persistent inflation played out
over the past three years, during the
2000s as a whole, inflation averaged
around 5.4 and 5.8 per cent, in terms of
wpi and cpi, respectively, down from
its earlier trend rate of about 7.5 per cent.
given this record and the empirical
evidence on the threshold level of
inflation that is conducive for sustained
growth, the objective is to contain
headline wpi inflation at around 5.0 per
cent in the short-term, and 3.0 per cent
over the medium-term, consistent with
india’s broader integration into the
global economy.

i)

monetary aggregates
31.
consistent with the above growth
projections and the reserve bank’s
inflation tolerance threshold, m3 growth
for 2013-14 is projected at 13.0 per cent
for policy purposes. consequently,
aggregate deposits of scbs are projected
to grow by 14.0 per cent. keeping in
view the resource requirements of the
private sector, the growth in non-food
credit of scbs is projected at 15.0 per
cent. as always, these numbers are
indicative projections and not targets.
the conduct of monetary policy would
be guided by the evolution of monetary
aggregates along these indicative
trajectories.

by far the biggest risk to the
economy stems from the cad
which, last year, was historically the
highest and well above the
sustainable level of 2.5 per cent of
gdp as estimated by the reserve
bank. admittedly, the fiscal deficit
is programmed to decline, but even
factoring that in, it is still high.
large fiscal deficits can potentially
spill over into the cad and
undermine its sustainability even
further. a large cad, appreciably
above the sustainable level year
after year, will put pressure on
servicing of external liabilities.

ii) even as the large cad is a risk by
itself, its financing exposes the
economy to the risk of sudden stop
and reversal of capital flows.
although the cad could be
financed last year because of easy
liquidity conditions in the global
system, the global liquidity situation
could quickly alter for edes,
including india, for two reasons.
first, the outlook for aes remains
uncertain, and even if there may be
no event shocks, there could well
be process shocks which could
result in capital outflows from
8

edes. second, with quantitative
easing (qe), ae central banks are
in uncharted territory with
considerable uncertainty about the
trajectory of recovery and the
calibration of qe. should global
liquidity conditions rapidly tighten,
india could potentially face a
problem of sudden stop and reversal
of capital flows jeopardising our
macro-financial stability.

the erosion of asset quality,
deteriorating cash flow situation of
borrowers eroding their credit
worthiness and heightened risk
premiums.
iv) looking ahead, the effectiveness of
monetary policy in bringing down
inflation pressures and anchoring
inflation expectations could be
undermined by supply constraints
in the economy, particularly in the
food and infrastructure sectors.
food price pressures, upward
revisions in the msps and rapid
wage increases are leading to a
wage-price spiral. without policy
efforts to unlock the tightening
supply constraints and bring
enduring improvements in
productivity and competitiveness,
growth could weaken even further
and inflationary strains could
re-emerge.

iii) sustained revival of growth is not
possible without a revival of
investment. but investment
sentiment remains inhibited owing
to subdued business confidence and
dented business profitability. both
borrowers and lenders have become
risk averse. borrowers have become
risk averse because of governance
concerns, delays in approvals and
tighter credit conditions. for
lenders, risk aversion stems from

iii. the policy stance
33.
the reserve bank began exiting
from the crisis driven expansionary
policy in october 2009. between january
2010 and october 2011, the reserve
bank cumulatively raised the crr by
100 bps and the policy repo rate 13 times
by a total of 375 bps, with the monetary
policy stance biased towards containing
inflation and anchoring inflation
expectations.

34.
in view of slowdown in growth,
especially investment activity, and some
moderation in inflation, the reserve
bank paused in december 2011. it
indicated that no further tightening might
be required and that future actions would
be towards lowering the rates. in january
2012, the reserve bank signaled a shift
in the policy stance towards addressing
increasing risks to growth by reversing
9

the tightening cycle. the crr was
reduced cumulatively by 125 bps during
january-march 2012 to prepare liquidity
conditions for a front-loaded 50 bps
reduction in the policy repo rate in april.

38.
first, growth has decelerated
continuously and steeply, more than
halving from 9.2 per cent in q4 of 201011 to 4.5 per cent in q3 of 2012-13. the
reserve bank’s current assessment is
that activity will remain subdued during
the first half of this year with a modest
pick-up, subject to appropriate conditions
ensuing, in the second half of 2013-14.

35.
through much of 2012-13, the
reserve bank persevered with efforts to
ease credit and liquidity conditions
through a 100 bps reduction in the slr
in august 2012, a cumulative 75 bps
reduction in the crr and 50 bps
reduction in the repo rate during
september 2012-march 2013.

39.
second, although headline wpi
inflation has eased by march 2013 to
come close to the reserve bank’s
tolerance threshold, it is important to
note that food price pressures persist and
supply constraints are endemic, which
could lead to a generalisation of inflation
and strains on the balance of payments.

36.
cumulatively, during the full year
2012-13, the policy repo rate was
reduced by 100 basis points, the slr by
100 bps and the crr by 75 basis points,
supported by liquidity injections through
omos of the order of `1.5 trillion. after
reducing the policy repo rate by 25 bps
in its mid-quarter review (mqr) of
march 2013, the reserve bank noted that
in view of the policy easing already
effected, the sluggish ebbing of inflation
and widening cad, the headroom for
further monetary easing was quite
limited.

40.
against this backdrop, the stance
of monetary policy is intended to:

37.
against the backdrop of global
and domestic macroeconomic conditions,
outlook and risks, the policy stance for
2013-14 has been guided by the following
considerations:

10

•

continue to address the accentuated
risks to growth;

•

guard against the risks of inflation
pressures re-emerging and adversely
impacting inflation expectations,
even as corrections in administered
prices release suppressed inflation;
and

•

appropriately manage liquidity to
ensure adequate credit flow to the
productive sectors of the economy.

iv. monetary measures
41.
on the basis of the current
assessment and in line with policy stance
outlined in section iii, the reserve bank
announces the following policy measures.

4.0 per cent of their net demand and time
liabilities (ndtl).
guidance
47.
the policy action undertaken in
this review carries forward the measures
put in place since january 2012 towards
supporting growth in the face of gradual
moderation of headline inflation. recent
monetary policy action, by itself, cannot
revive growth. it needs to be supplemented
by efforts towards easing the supply
bottlenecks, improving governance and
stepping up public investment, alongside
continuing commitment to fiscal
consolidation. with upside risks to
inflation still significant in the near term
in view of sectoral demand supply
imbalances, ongoing correction in
administered prices and pressures
stemming from msp increases, monetary
policy cannot afford to lower its guard
against the possibility of resurgence of
inflation pressures. monetary policy will
also have to remain alert to the risks on
account of the cad and its financing,
which could warrant a swift reversal of
the policy stance. overall, the balance of
risks stemming from the reserve bank’s
assessment of the growth-inflation
dynamic yields little space for further
monetary easing. the reserve bank will
endeavour to actively manage liquidity

this part of the statement reviews
the progress on various developmental
and regulatory policy measures
announced by the reserve bank in recent
policy statements and also sets out fresh
measures.

weak segments of the financial system,
building up capital and liquidity buffers
and forward looking provisioning,
developing a robust framework for
systemically important entities,
enhancing disclosures to improve market
discipline, establishing effective
resolution regimes including crossborder resolution agreements, extending
the regulatory perimeter to unregulated
entities, and convergence of accounting
norms.

51.
near-term risks to global financial
stability are retreating as the probability
associated with tail events has reduced,
rekindling risk appetite as reflected in
sharp rallies in financial markets. in aes,
funding conditions have improved, but
credit conditions remain stressed on
concerns about debt overhangs and the
persisting fragility of balance sheets. for
edes, potential spillovers from
unconventional policies in aes remain
significant, especially mispricing of
credit risk, a rise in liquidity risk, and
excessive capital flows entailing
increased debt and foreign exchange
exposure in response to low borrowing
costs. in addition to safeguarding
domestic financial stability, these
economies also face the challenge of
creating conducive financing conditions
for accelerating growth with stability.

53.
in this challenging and uncertain
international environment, ongoing
structural reforms seek to make the
indian banking system more efficient,
resilient, and socially more relevant. the
emphasis has been on strengthening
balance sheets and governance
frameworks in a non-disruptive manner,
sequenced into fortifying and refining
the prudential framework in line with
basel iii, but adapted to country-specific
requirements. a key area of focus has
been managing systemic risks in the time
dimension through countercyclical
policies employing time varying sectoral
risk weights and provisioning as also
cross-sectionally in terms of
interconnectedness and common
exposures. the triad of financial
inclusion, financial literacy and consumer
protection have been recognised as
intertwining threads in the pursuit of

52.
internationally, efforts towards
strengthening the global financial
regulatory architecture remain
incomplete and delayed, increasing
vulnerability and uncertainty. decisive
and well-coordinated actions are needed
to progress resolutely on restructuring
13

financial stability. as regards non-bank
financial entities, the initial focus on
depositor protection has broadened into
a more comprehensive framework aimed
at mitigating systemic risks. the
development of financial markets,
products and processes continues to be
pursued within the broader context of
financial stability, balancing innovations
with the containment of excesses in tune
with the maturing of the financial system
and the needs of the real economy.

strengthening of financial market
infrastructure; improving credit flow to
productive sectors, including agriculture;
implementation of a dynamic
provisioning regime for banks; designing
of a framework for monitoring liquidity
risk; finalisation of guidelines for
licensing of new banks in the private
sector; reviewing the banking structure
in india; regulation of wealth management
activities; customer service initiatives;
expansion of payment system
infrastructure and mitigation of
concentration risk in the system;
streamlining the system of distribution
of banknotes and coins; and improving
the mechanism for detection and
reporting of counterfeit banknotes.

54.
against this backdrop, the
statement on developmental and
regulatory policies for 2013-14 assesses
the progress made on past policy
announcements and sets out the policy
initiatives in key areas which include

i. financial stability

high cad along with weakening external
sector parameters, the stressed fiscal
situation, and increasing corporate
leverage, especially external commercial
borrowings with unhedged exposures
were identified as other challenges to
macroeconomic stability. for the banking
sector, concerns relating to tight liquidity
conditions and deteriorating asset quality
remain, though the sector has remained
resilient to credit, market, and liquidity
risks and capable of withstanding
macroeconomic shocks, given the
comfortable capital to risk-weighted

55.
the sixth financial stability
report (fsr), released in december
2012, observed that the overall
macroeconomic risks in the indian
financial system had increased since the
assessment made in june 2012. apart
from risks to global growth and financial
stability, domestic factors such as decline
in growth coupled with relatively high
inflation, fall in domestic saving, and
particularly household financial saving,
were found to have increased risks to
macroeconomic stability. in addition, the

assets ratio (crar) for the system as a
whole. the inter-linkages among diverse
sectors of the financial system were,
however, found to be strong with risk of
contagion in case of a failure of an
institution in the core remaining high.
mutual funds and insurance companies
were identified as a potential source of
liquidity contagion, being lenders in the
financial system.

cooperation in the field of supervision.
the mou envisages cooperation in the
field of consolidated supervision and

the sub-committee of the fsdc
approved the national strategy for
financial education (nsfe). the nsfe
entails provision of financial education
for all indians so as to understand the
need and use of saving, the advantages
of using the formal financial sector and
various options to convert saving into
investment, protection through insurance
and a realistic recognition of the
attributes of these options. the nsfe
has been revised, incorporating the
feedback received from public
consultations and from a global peer
review.

as stated in the sqr of october
2012, the report of the working group
on government securities (g-secs) and
interest rate derivatives markets
(chairman: shri r. gandhi) was finalised
in august 2012. some of the
recommendations such as reducing the

securities in state development loans;
standardising interest rate swap (irs)
contracts to facilitate centralised clearing
and settlement of these contracts; and
migration of secondary market reporting
of over-the-counter (otc) trades in

clearcorp repo order matching system
(croms), respectively, have already
been implemented. further, the
government of india has announced the
introduction of inflation-indexed bonds
for retail investors in the union budget
2013-14. as will be indicated later in this
section, the dispensation regarding held

reviewed.

fixed interest rate loan products by banks
(chairman: shri k.k. vohra) was placed
on the reserve bank’s website inviting
views/suggestions from the public/
stakeholders. taking into account the
feedback received, the final report was
put out on the reserve bank’s website
in january 2013. banks may consider
implementing these recommendations so
that retail customers are not adversely
impacted by undue interest rate risk
arising out of changes in economic
cycles and policy rates.
participation of foreign institutional
investors in currency derivatives
61.
the finance minister, in his
budget speech for 2013-14, had
announced that foreign institutional
investors (fiis) will be permitted to
participate in the currency derivatives
segment of exchanges to the extent of
their rupee-denominated exposure in the
country. in line with the above
announcement, it is proposed to:

other recommendations
including consolidation of the
government of india’s public debt;
introduction of cash settled 10-year
interest rate futures (irf); introduction
of single bond futures; and simplification
of operational procedures for seamless
movement of securities from sgl form
to demat form and vice versa are being
examined in consultation with all
stakeholders.

allow fiis to hedge their currency
risk by using exchange traded
currency futures in the domestic
exchanges.

the recommendations are under
examination. the report will be placed
on the reserve bank’s website shortly.
export reporting and follow-up
64.
as stated in the sqr, a working
group (chairperson: smt. rashmi
fauzdar) was constituted to identify
gaps in the current export reporting and
follow-up procedure, including large
number of unmatched export transactions
between customs and bank reporting,
and to recommend suitable reengineering of the system. the
recommendations of the working group
are under implementation. with the
envisaged architecture expected to be
put in place by end-september 2013,
authorised dealers (ads) would be
required to regularly update the status
of documents evidencing exports and
receipt of export proceeds for the
transactions pertaining to them in the
reserve bank’s data base, ensuring
effective follow-up of large value
transactions/ transactions of serious

monitoring of export transactions.

financial market infrastructure
technical committee on services/
facilities for exporters
63.
in order to examine various issues
relating to exports such as the availability
of credit, transaction costs, insurance,
factoring and other procedural aspects in
the dealings of exporters with banks and
financial institutions, a technical
committee on services/facilities to
exporters (chairman: shri g.
padmanabhan) was constituted on

in the light of feedback received
from stakeholders regarding enhancement

to be classified as priority sector advances
within the broad contours of the priority
17

sector architecture, it is proposed to:
•

up to suggest a structured mechanism to
be put in place by banks to monitor the
entire gamut of credit related issues
pertaining to the sector. the committee
has since submitted its report and based
on its recommendations, it has been
decided that banks need to:

increase the loan limit for micro and
small enterprises (mses) in the
services sector, as defined in the
micro, small and medium
enterprises development
(msmed) act 2006, from `20
million to `50 million per borrower;

•

increase the loan limit from `10
million to `50 million per borrower
for bank loans to dealers/sellers of
fertilisers, pesticides, seeds, cattle
feed, poultry feed, agricultural
implements and other inputs which
are classified as indirect finance to
agriculture; and

•

raise the limit on pledge loans
(including against warehouse
receipts) from the current limit of
`2.5 million to `5 million for
classification as direct agriculture
loans in the case of individual
farmers and as indirect agriculture
loans in the case of corporates,
partnership firms and institutions
engaged in agriculture and allied
activities.

guidelines are being issued separately.
micro and small enterprises
66.
in view of the concerns emerging
from the deceleration in credit growth to
the mse sector, an indian banking
association (iba)-led sub-committee
(chairman: shri k.r. kamath) was set
18

•

strengthen their existing systems of
monitoring credit growth to the
sector and put in place a systemdriven comprehensive performance
management information system
(mis) at every supervisory level
(branch, region, zone, head office)
which should be critically evaluated
on a regular basis;

•

put in place a system of e-tracking
of mse loan applications and
monitor the loan application
disposal process in banks, giving
branch-wise, region-wise, zonewise and state-wise positions. a
format for the purpose will be
provided to banks as recommended
by the sub-committee. the position
in this regard may be displayed by
banks on their websites; and

•

monitor timely rehabilitation of sick
mse units. a format for the purpose
will be provided to banks as
recommended by the subcommittee. the progress in
rehabilitation of sick mse units
should be available on the website
of banks.

detailed guidelines are being issued
separately.

•

direct benefit transfer

financial literacy material

67.
with a view to facilitating direct
benefit transfer (dbt) for the delivery
of social welfare benefits by direct credit
to the bank accounts of beneficiaries, it
is proposed to advise banks to:
•

open accounts for all eligible
individuals in camp mode with the
support of local government
authorities;

•

seed the existing accounts or the
new accounts opened with aadhaar
numbers; and

•

put in place an effective mechanism
to monitor and review the progress
in the implementation of dbt.

disaggregate the fips to the
controlling office and branch level.

69.
in order to link the financially
excluded segment with the banking
system, a model for conduct of literacy
camps by banks has been designed,
detailing the operational modalities to
culminate in effective financial access to
the excluded. further, to ensure
consistency in the financial literacy
material reaching the target audience in
a simple and lucid manner, the reserve
bank has prepared comprehensive
financial literacy material consisting of
a financial literacy guide, a financial
diary and a set of 16 financial literacy
posters. banks are, therefore, advised to:

guidelines are being issued separately.

•

use the model of financial literacy
camps as a tool to achieve the
targets set under their fips;

•

use the financial literacy material as
a standard curriculum in the literacy
camps; and

•

be innovative in devising suitable
communication channels so that the
messages reach the target audience
effectively.

financial inclusion plan 2013-16
68.
the implementation of the
financial inclusion plan (fip) 2010-13,
introduced for the first time in april
2010, has led to the establishment of
banking outlets in more than 2 lakh
villages. in order to take financial
inclusion to the next stage of providing
universal coverage and facilitating
electronic benefit transfer (ebt), banks
have been advised to draw up the next
fip for the period 2013-16. the fips
submitted by banks would be discussed

lead bank scheme - metropolitan
areas
70.
at present, the lead bank
scheme (lbs) is applicable to all
19

districts in the country, excluding
districts in metropolitan areas. however,
the challenge of financial exclusion is
widespread in metropolitan areas also,
especially amongst the disadvantaged
and low-income groups. with the
objective of providing an institutional
mechanism for coordination between
government authorities and banks,
facilitating doorstep banking to the
excluded segment of urban poor, and
to implement dbt, it has been decided
to:
•

of the recommendations of the expert
committee, wherever applicable.
progress in this regard will be reported
in the sqr of october 2013.
customer service
implementation of the damodaran
committee report
73.
as mentioned in the monetary
policy statement of april 2012, a subgroup of the iba was constituted to
examine implementation of some of the
recommendations of the damodaran
committee. these include benchmarking
of service charges for basic banking
services, charges for non-home
branch transactions, zero liability for
automated teller machine (atm)/
point-of-sale (pos)/internet banking
transactions, and placing the onus on
banks to prove customer negligence
and discrimination in interest rates
offered to old and new borrowers under
the floating interest rate regime. the
iba has been advised to draw up a
strategic roadmap for implementation
of these recommendations, increase
customer awareness and ensure that the
recommendations of the committee
result in optimisation of desired
outcomes.

bring all districts in metropolitan
areas under the fold of the lbs.

rural cooperatives: streamlining of
short term cooperative credit
structure
71.
as announced in the sqr, the
reserve bank constituted an expert
committee (chairman: dr. prakash
bakshi) to undertake an in-depth analysis
of the short-term cooperative credit
structure (stccs). the committee
submitted its report in january 2013 and
made 25 recommendations towards
strengthening of the rural cooperative
credit architecture.
72.
an implementation committee
(chairman: shri v. ramakrishna rao)
comprising members from the national
bank for agriculture and rural
development (nabard) and the
reserve bank has been formed to ensure
effective and expeditious implementation

recommendations of damodaran
committee – uniformity in intersol
charges
74.
with the introduction of core
banking solution (cbs), it is expected
20

that customers of banks would be treated
uniformly at any sales or service delivery
point. it is observed, however, that some
banks are discriminating against their
own customers on the basis of one branch
being designated as the ‘home branch’
where charges are not levied for products/
services and other branches being
referred to as ‘non-home’ branches
where charges are levied for the same
products/services. this practice is
contrary to the spirit of the reserve
bank’s guidelines on reasonableness of
bank charges. with a view to ensuring
that bank customers are treated fairly and
reasonably without any discrimination
and in a transparent manner at all
branches of banks/service delivery
locations, banks are advised to:

•

follow a uniform, fair and transparent
pricing policy and not discriminate
between their customers at home
branch and non-home branches.

detailed guidelines will be issued by
end-june 2013.
banking ombudsman scheme
75.
as stated in the sqr of october
2012, the reserve bank constituted a
working group to review, update, and
revise the banking ombudsman scheme,
2006 (chairperson: smt. suma varma)
in the light of the recommendations and
suggestions of the committee on
customer service in banks and the rajya
sabha committee on subordinate
legislation. the working group
submitted its report in january 2013,
which is under examination.

iv. regulatory and supervisory measures
implementation of basel iii capital
regulation

charge has been deferred to january 1,
2014.

76.
the reserve bank’s guidelines
on basel iii capital regulation have been
implemented from april 1, 2013 with the
exception of credit valuation adjustment
(cva) risk capital charge for otc
derivatives. pending resolution of certain
issues related to introduction of
mandatory forex forward guaranteed
settlement through a central counterparty,
the implementation of cva risk capital

77.
as announced in the sqr, draft
guidelines were issued on: (i) composition
of capital disclosure requirements; and
(ii) capital requirements for banks’
exposures to central counterparties. it is
proposed to:
•

21

issue the final guidelines on
composition of capital disclosure
requirements by end-may 2013; and

•

issue the final guidelines on capital
requirements for banks’ exposures
to central counterparties by endjune 2013.

finalises the relevant framework. the
basel committee has issued basel iii:
the liquidity coverage ratio and
liquidity risk monitoring tools in
january 2013 and is in the process of
finalising the nsfr and disclosure
requirements. the lcr is to be
implemented from january 1, 2015 and
the nsfr from january 1, 2018. the
reserve bank will issue the final
guidelines on basel iii liquidity standards
and liquidity risk monitoring tools,
taking into account the revisions by the
basel committee.

guidelines on liquidity coverage
ratio and liquidity risk monitoring
tools under basel iii
78.
the basel iii framework on
liquidity standards includes liquidity
coverage ratio (lcr), net stable
funding ratio (nsfr) and liquidity risk
monitoring tools. the reserve bank had
issued draft guidelines on liquidity risk
management and basel iii framework
on liquidity standards in february 2012.
after taking into account the feedback
received from stakeholders, the
guidelines on liquidity risk management
were issued in november 2012. these
included enhanced guidance on liquidity
risk governance, and measurement,
monitoring and reporting to the reserve
bank on liquidity positions. the basel
iii liquidity standards were subject to an
observation period/revision by the basel
committee with a view to addressing any
unintended consequences that the
standards may have for financial markets,
credit extension and economic growth.
the reserve bank indicated in the
guidelines on liquidity risk management
issued in november 2012 that the
guidelines on basel iii liquidity standards
will be issued once the basel committee

implementation of dynamic
provisioning regime for banks in
india
79.
the reserve bank had placed a
discussion paper on introduction of
dynamic loan loss provisioning
framework for banks in india on its
website in march 2012, soliciting views/
comments. the comments/views
received by the reserve bank from
stakeholders are under examination and
various parameters of the proposed
dynamic provisioning are being recalibrated, based on new and updated
data obtained from banks. it is proposed
to:
•

22

issue the final guidelines on dynamic
provisioning framework and its
implementation in a phased manner
by end-june 2013.

final guidelines on management of
intra-group transactions and
exposures

comments/suggestions received in this
regard were under examination and the
draft guidelines would be issued by endjanuary 2013. accordingly, the draft
guidelines were issued on january 31,
2013 for comments till february 28,
2013. taking into account the comments
received, it has been decided to:

80.
the draft guidelines on
management of intra-group transactions
and exposures (ites) were issued in
august 2012. the draft guidelines
prescribed prudential exposure limits on
the intra-group exposure of banks along
with measures to ensure that banks
maintain an arm’s length relationship in
their dealings with group entities and
meet minimum requirements with
respect to group risk management and
group-wide oversight. the measures are
aimed at ensuring that banks engage in
ites in a safe and sound manner for
containing concentration and contagion
risk arising out of ites. the comments/
feedback on the draft guidelines have
been received from various stakeholders
and are under examination. it is proposed
to:
•

•

issue the prudential guidelines on
restructuring of advances by banks/
financial institutions by end-may
2013.

commercial real estate - residential
housing: prudential norms
82.
in september 2009, the reserve
bank had issued guidelines on
classification of certain exposures as
commercial real estate (cre)
exposures. cre exposures are sensitive
in view of their inherent price volatilities.
therefore, these exposures generally
attract higher risk weights and higher
provisioning requirements. however, it
has been generally observed that the
residential housing complex sector under
the cre poses lower risk than the other
components of cre sector. accordingly,
it is proposed to:

issue final guidelines on management
of ites by end-june 2013.

prudential guidelines on restructuring
of advances by banks/financial
institutions

•

81.
it was announced in the sqr that
the recommendations of the working
group (chairman: shri b. mahapatra) to
review the existing prudential guidelines
on restructuring of advances by banks/
financial institutions as also the

carve out a sub-sector of ‘creresidential housing’ within the
cre sector with appropriate
prudential regulatory norms on risk
weights and provisioning.

detailed guidelines will be issued by
end-june 2013.

guidelines on reset of credit
enhancement in securitisation

the last friday of the second preceding
fortnight. this relaxation was allowed
taking into account the requirement of
maintenance of slr of 25 per cent of
dtl under section 24 of the banking
regulation act, 1949 at that time. the
slr requirement has since been brought
down to 23 per cent of dtl. accordingly,
it is proposed that:

83.
the reserve bank issued draft
guidelines on ‘revisions to the
guidelines on securitisation
transactions’ in may 2012. the
guidelines introduced norms on
minimum holding period, minimum
retention ratio, loan origination standards
and standards of due diligence with
regard to securitisation transactions to
ensure orderly growth of the indian
securitisation market. while the extant
guidelines do not permit reset of credit
enhancements during the life of the
securities issued by the special purpose
vehicle, it was indicated in may 2012
that guidelines on resetting of credit
enhancement would be issued separately.
accordingly, it is proposed to:
•

•

banks may exceed the present limit
of 25 per cent of total investments
under the htm category provided:
(a) the excess comprises only of
slr securities; and
(b) the total slr securities held in
the htm category is not more
than 23 per cent of their dtl as
on the last friday of the second
preceding fortnight, i.e., in
alignment with the current slr
requirement.

issue the final guidelines on reset of
credit enhancement in securitisation
by end-june 2013.

this realignment from 25 per cent to 23
per cent, in line with the recommendations
of the working group on government
securities and interest rate derivatives
markets, would be effected by way of
reduction of at least 50 bps every quarter,
beginning with the quarter ending june
2013.

slr holdings under held to maturity
category
84.
in terms of extant instructions
issued in september 2004, banks are
permitted to exceed the limit of 25 per
cent of total investments under htm
category, provided the excess comprises
only of slr securities and the total slr
securities held in the htm category is
not more than 25 per cent of their
demand and time liabilities (dtl) as on

detailed guidelines will be issued
separately.
banking structure in india
85.
the guidelines on licensing of
new banks in the private sector issued
24

in february 2013 indicated that the
reserve bank would prepare a policy
discussion paper on the banking structure
in india within two months, keeping in
view the recommendations of the
committee on banking sector reforms,
1998 (chairman: shri m. narasimham),
the committee on financial sector
reforms, 2008 (chairman: shri
raghuram rajan), and other viewpoints.
the discussion paper would cover issues
such as consolidation of large-sized
banks with a view to having a few global
banks, desirability and practicality of
having small, localised banks as preferred
vehicles for financial inclusion, the need
for having investment banks through
differentiated licensing regime for
domestic and foreign banks instead of
granting of universal banking licence,
policy regarding presence of foreign
banks in india, conversion of urban
cooperative banks into commercial
banks, and periodicity of licensing new
banks, whether in blocks or on tap. it is,
therefore, proposed to:

reported allegations that certain banks
were involved in structuring transactions
to aid tax evasion and fraudulent transfer
of funds. the investigations revealed the
need for better regulatory compliance by
banks. it is proposed to issue guidelines
which would include, inter alia, the
following:

•

(b) marketing and distribution of third
party financial products

(a) wealth management
87.
wealth management services
(wms) generally include referral
services, investment advisory services
(ias) and portfolio management services
(pms). in india, banks with welldeveloped branch network have access
to a large customer base. banks offering
wealth management services are exposed
to reputational risks on account of misselling of products, conflict of interest,
lack of knowledge and clarity about
products and frauds. it is, therefore,
proposed to:
•

issue the discussion paper on the
banking structure in india for
comments by end-june 2013.

issue draft guidelines on wealth
management services offered by
banks by end-june 2013.

88.
as per extant instructions, banks
are allowed to market insurance and
mutual fund products as agents of other
entities on non-risk participation basis.
it has been observed that in some cases,
banks did not have clear segregation of
duties of marketing personnel from other

provision of wealth management
services and marketing and
distribution of third party financial
products
86.
the reserve bank recently
undertook investigations in the light of
25

branch functions, and bank employees
were directly receiving incentives from
third parties such as insurance, mutual
fund and other entities for selling their
products. such practices may lead to
mis-selling and distortion of the staff
incentive structure. it is, therefore,
proposed to advise banks to:

distributing third party products as
agents. some banks are also not filing
cash transaction reports (ctrs) or
suspicious transaction reports (strs)
in such cases, wherever required. in this
context, it is proposed to advise banks
to:
•

carry out customer due diligence as
required under extant kyc/aml/
cft guidelines wherever third party
products are sold as agents as a
measure of abundant precaution,
even though kyc/aml/cft
regulations are also applicable to the
principal, i.e., the third party vendor
of the products;

•

ensure segregation of the marketing
function from the approval/
transactional process at bank
branches;

•

ensure that its employees do not
receive cash/non-cash incentives
directly from insurance companies,
mutual funds and other third party
product providers; and

frequently asked questions on kyc/
aml/cft

89.
during the investigations referred
to above, it was observed that banks are
not carrying out customer due diligence
as required under kyc/aml/cft
guidelines while marketing and

90.
in order to educate the general
public as also banks, the reserve bank
has been placing on its website frequently
26

asked questions (faqs) on kyc/aml/
cft. the existing faqs on kyc/aml/
cft guidelines were placed on the
website in may 2011. since then, a
number of new developments have taken
place in this area including simplification
of kyc norms for further enhancing
financial inclusion. with a view to
facilitating understanding of kyc/aml/
cft requirements and compliance
thereof in a hassle-free manner by banks
and the general public for promoting
financial inclusion, it is proposed to:
•

may be reflective of opaqueness in the
system.
92.
credit management in a bank is
essentially an internal management
function and banks are expected to
prepare a well-defined loan policy
approved by their boards, laying down,
inter alia, the factors taken into
consideration for deciding interest rates.
however, keeping in view the findings
in this regard, banks are advised to have
management oversight on such practices
and also frame policies that ensure
pricing of loans, especially retail loans,
is transparent, realistic, and related to the
risk perception of the borrowers.

replace the existing faqs on kyc/
aml/cft with a comprehensive
set of questions and answers by endjune 2013.

pricing of retail loans

depositor education and awareness
fund

91.
the reserve bank has observed
wide variations in the rate of interest
charged to retail borrowers by banks
even when the loan was sanctioned on
the same day. in terms of extant
instructions, all categories of loans (with
certain specified exemptions) are to be
linked to the base rate from july 2010.
it is expected that the final rate of interest
charged to the borrower will include
product and customer specific charges
and will be reasonable and transparent.
however, the very wide variation in rates
of interest charged by banks on retail
loans to different borrowers on the same
day cannot possibly be attributed to
customers’ risk profiles. such a practice

93.
pursuant to the enactment of the
banking laws (amendment) act, 2012,
section 26a has been inserted in the
banking regulation act, 1949 which,
inter alia, empowers the reserve bank
to establish a depositor education and
awareness fund (deaf). deaf will be
credited with the amount to the credit of
any account in india with a banking
company which has not been operated
upon for a period of ten years or any
deposit or any amount remaining
unclaimed for more than ten years within
a period of three months from the expiry
of ten years. deaf shall be utilised for
promotion of depositors’ interest and for
such other purposes considered
27

necessary for the promotion of
depositors’ interests as specified by the
reserve bank from time to time.
however, the provisions of section 26a
do not prevent a depositor from claiming
his/her deposit or operating his/her
account or deposit after the expiry of the
period of ten years and the banking
company should pay the deposit amount
and claim refund of such amount from
deaf. in view of the above, it is
proposed to:
•

of their credit appraisal process. the
committee will submit its report by endseptember 2013.
annual branch expansion plan
96.
at present, domestic scheduled
commercial banks (scbs) are required
to allocate at least 25 per cent of the total
number of branches proposed to be
opened during a year in unbanked rural
(tier 5 and tier 6) centres while preparing
their annual branch expansion plan
(abep). branch expansion in rural areas
is essential to address the existing
asymmetries in achieving financial
inclusion. to facilitate speedier branch
expansion in unbanked rural centres for
ensuring seamless roll out of the dbt
scheme of the government of india,
banks are advised to:

finalise the modalities for setting up
of deaf by end-september 2013.

dissemination of credit information
94.
it was stated in the sqr that
credit institutions should furnish timely
and accurate credit information on their
borrowers and make extensive use of
available credit information as a part of
their credit appraisal processes.

•

95.
accordingly, a committee
(chairman: shri aditya puri) consisting
of representatives from credit
information companies and credit
institutions has been constituted to
examine the available formats for
furnishing of credit information by
credit institutions to the credit
information companies in respect of
different sectors. the committee would
also suggest best practices for the
guidance of credit institutions in respect
of usage of credit information as a part

front-load the opening of branches
in unbanked rural centres over a 3
year cycle co-terminus with the fip.
credit will be given for branches
opened in unbanked rural centres in
excess of 25 per cent in a year which
will be carried forward to the
subsequent year of the fip.

detailed guidelines will be issued by
end-june 2013.
import of gold
97.
the working group on gold
(chairman: shri k.u.b. rao) had
recommended aligning gold import
regulations with the rest of imports with
28

a view to reducing gold imports by
creating a level playing field between
gold imports and other imports. currently,
banks authorised by the reserve bank
are permitted to import gold on: (i)
consignment basis; (ii) unfixed price
basis; and (iii) loan basis. gold is also
imported directly by export oriented
units (eous) / units in special economic
zones (sezs) in the gems and jewellery
sector and nominated agencies / banks
using letters of credit (lcs). the bulk of
the gold imported by nominated banks
is, however, on consignment basis
whereby the nominated banks do not
have to fund these stocks. with a view
to reducing the demand for gold for
domestic use, it is proposed to:

exchange traded funds and units of gold
mutual funds. while there may not be
any objection to grant of advances
against specially minted gold coins sold
by banks, there is a risk that some of
these coins would be weighing much
more, thereby circumventing the
reserve bank’s guidelines regarding
restrictions on grant of advance against
gold bullion. accordingly, it is proposed
to:   

•

unhedged foreign currency exposure

•

restrict the facility of advances
against the security of gold coins
per customer to gold coins weighing
up to 50 gms.

detailed guidelines will be issued by
end-may 2013.

restrict the import of gold on
consignment basis by banks only to
meet the genuine needs of exporters
of gold jewellery.

99.
in terms of extant instructions,
banks should put in place a proper
mechanism to rigorously evaluate the
risks arising out of unhedged foreign
currency exposure of corporates and
price them in the credit risk premium,
while also considering stipulating a limit
on the unhedged positions of corporates
on the basis of banks’ board-approved
policy. these measures are of utmost
importance since unhedged forex
exposures of borrowers is a source of risk
not only to them but also to the financing
banks and the financial system, especially
in times of currency volatility. the above
measures need to be strengthened by

detailed guidelines will be issued by
end-may 2013.
lending against gold
98.
as per extant instructions, banks
are currently permitted to grant advances
against gold ornaments and other
jewellery and against specially minted
gold coins sold by banks. however, no
advances can be granted by banks for
purchase of gold in any form, including
primary gold, gold bullion, gold
jewellery, gold coins, units of gold
29

requiring the corporates to put in place
a risk management policy for their
unhedged forex exposures. these
measures have not yet been adequately
put in place. in view of this and in order
to address the risks on account of
unhedged forex exposure of corporates,
it is proposed to:

•

increase the risk weight and
provisioning requirement on banks’
exposures to corporates on account
of the corporates’ unhedged forex
exposure positions.

detailed guidelines will be issued by
end-june 2013.

v. institutional developments
non-banking financial companies

shared it resources in order to optimise
costs while maintaining the desired
levels of efficiency and security. the
feasibility of such shared resources by
the banking sector needs to be explored
wherever possible, taking into account
security issues, data integrity and
confidentiality. after making an
assessment of various issues, it is
proposed to advise banks in this regard
by end-august 2013.

dealing in gold loans
100. on february 6, 2013, the reserve
bank placed on its website the final
report of the working group on gold
(chairman: shri k.u.b. rao). the
working group has made a number of
recommendations pertaining to the nonbanking financial companies (nbfcs)
involved in lending against the collateral
of gold. these include loan to value ratio,
branch expansion, and review of fair
practices code provisions with regard to
auction and transparency in loan terms.
the recommendations are being
examined by the reserve bank and it is
proposed to:
•

business continuity plan, vulnerability
assessment and penetration testing
of information systems by banks
102. as stated in the monetary policy
statement of april 2012, banks were
advised to put in place appropriate
information security (is) framework
and it governance structures to enable,
inter alia, better alignment between it
and business. in order for banks to
secure their iss, ensure their continuity,
and check their robustness, they are
required to put in place appropriate
business continuity plans (bcps) and

issue guidelines to nbfcs by endmay 2013.

sharing of information technology
resources by banks
101. with increased use of information
technology (it) infrastructure by banks,
there is a need to examine the issue of
30

test them periodically. these iss should
be subjected to vulnerability assessment
and penetration testing. policies
governing the above need to be approved
at the board level. suitable guidelines in
this regard will be issued to banks by
end-june 2013.

in the payment space is seen as a risk
which needs to be addressed. this was
highlighted in the ‘payment systems in
india: vision 2012-15’. accordingly, it
is proposed to:
•

payment and settlement systems
white label point of sale
103. in order to increase the reach of
point of sale (pos) infrastructure to
rural areas and promote electronic
payments, it is proposed to:
•

alternate payments: committee for
implementation of giro based
payment system

prepare a discussion paper on white
label pos and place it in the public
domain for comments.

106. following the announcement in
the sqr, a committee for implementation
of giro based payment system
(chairman: shri g. padmanabhan) was
constituted in january 2013. the
committee has submitted its report on
april 29, 2013. the report is under
examination.

expansion of payment infrastructure
104. in order to achieve a truly interoperable and integrated payment system,
it is necessary that the payment systems
operated by non-banks are also connected
to existing inter-bank card payment
systems as envisaged in the document
entitled ‘payment systems in india:
vision 2012-15’. accordingly, it is
proposed to:
•

p r e p a r e a d i s c u s s i o n p a p e r  
examining the measures to be taken
to mitigate and eliminate
concentration risk in payment
system infrastructure.

uniform routing code and account
number structure
107. as announced in the sqr, a
technical committee (chairman: shri
vijay chugh) comprising various
stakeholders was constituted to examine
the feasibility of a uniform routing code
and uniform account number across
banks. the committee has since
submitted its report and its
recommendations are being examined by
the reserve bank.

issue draft guidelines/access policy
for allowing non-bank authorised
entities to be part of the payment
system infrastructure.

coins in the country, there is a need for
identification of alternative avenues for
their distribution by banks. for this
purpose, banks may explore the
possibility of offering these services
through business correspondents (bc)
and consider engaging the services of
cash in transit (cit) entities for the
purpose of distribution of banknotes and
coins, thereby addressing the last mile
connectivity issues.

authentication of card present transactions
and other related issues. the working
group is expected to submit its report by
end-june 2013.

detailed guidelines will be issued by
end-june 2013.
improving currency distribution in
districts – identification of lead
banks

currency management

distribution of banknotes and coins
– alternative avenues

111. with a view to ensuring that
banks have a more pronounced stake in
the distribution of banknotes and coins
and also to facilitate their uninterrupted
supply in places other than metropolitan
and urban centres, it is proposed to
formulate a scheme on the lines of the
lead bank scheme and to allot specific
areas (districts/states) to individual
banks. the identified lead bank will be
responsible for ensuring that the genuine
needs of people for clean notes and coins
are appropriately met through proper
coordination with the currency chests
and small coin depots situated in that
area.

110. with a view to effectively meeting
the growing demand for banknotes and

detailed guidelines will be issued by
end-june 2013.

distribution of banknotes and coins
– review of incentives and penalties
109. in pursuance of the announcement
made in the monetary policy statement
of april 2012, a roadmap for making
available services relating to distribution
of banknotes and coins to members of
the public by identified branches of
banks for improved customer service is
being worked out.
detailed guidelines are being issued by
end-june 2013.

detection and reporting of counterfeit
banknotes

put into re-circulation without being
machine-processed for authenticity.
banks were also advised in november
2012 that wherever counterfeit notes are
detected but not impounded and reported,
it will be construed as wilful involvement
of the bank concerned in circulating
counterfeit notes and may attract penal
measures.

112. t h e d e p a r t m e n t - r e l a t e d
parliament standing committee (dpsc)
on ministry of home affairs in its 161st
report has recommended that efforts by
the reserve bank to constantly upgrade
security features in high value currency
notes and strengthen mechanisms for
detection of counterfeit notes should be
made more effective in eradicating the
menace of counterfeit notes.

115. in view of the recommendation
of the dpsc for addressing the menace
of counterfeit notes, it has now been
decided that in order to encourage banks
to report counterfeit notes detected by
them, a scheme of incentives for banks
will be introduced. simultaneously, the
existing penalty for non-detection and
non-reporting of counterfeit notes by
banks is being revisited.

113. while incorporating new security
features/new designs in the banknotes to
stay ahead of counterfeiters is an ongoing
process, the process of incorporation of
better and improved security features has
since been initiated by the government
of india in consultation with the reserve
bank and other stakeholders.

detailed guidelines will be issued by
end-june 2013.

114. furthermore, as a step towards
strengthening the mechanism for
detection of counterfeit notes, the
reserve bank has advised banks in may
