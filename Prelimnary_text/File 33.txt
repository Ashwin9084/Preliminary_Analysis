reserve bank of india
monetary policy statement 2010-11
by
dr. d. subbarao
governor

the monetary policy for 2010-11
is set against a rather complex economic
backdrop. although the situation is more
reassuring than it was a quarter ago,
uncertainty about the shape and pace of
global recovery persists. private
spending in advanced economies
continues to be constrained and inflation
remains generally subdued making it
likely that fiscal and monetary stimuli
in these economies will continue for an
extended period. emerging market
economies (emes) are significantly
ahead on the recovery curve, but some
of them are also facing inflationary
pressures.
2.
india’s growth-inflation dynamics
are in contrast to the overall global
scenario. the economy is recovering
rapidly from the growth slowdown but
inflationary pressures, which were
triggered by supply side factors, are now
developing into a wider inflationary
process. as the domestic balance of risks
shifts from growth slowdown to inflation,
our policy stance must recognise and
respond to this transition. while global
policy co-ordination was critical in
dealing with a worldwide crisis, the exit
process will necessarily be differentiated
on the basis of the macroeconomic
condition in each country. india’s rapid

turnaround after the crisis induced
slowdown evidences the resilience of our
economy and our financial sector.
however, this should not divert us from
the need to bring back into focus the twin
challenges of macroeconomic stability
and financial sector development.
3.
this statement is organised in two
parts. part a covers monetary policy and
is divided into four sections: section i
provides an overview of global and
domestic macroeconomic developments;
section ii sets out the outlook and
projections for growth, inflation and
monetary aggregates; section iii explains
the stance of monetary policy; and section
iv specifies the monetary measures.
part b covers developmental and
regulatory policies and is organised into
six sections: financial stability (section
i), interest rate policy (section ii),
financial markets (section iii), credit
delivery and financial inclusion (section
iv), regulatory and supervisory
measures for commercial banks (section
v) and institutional developments
(section vi).
4.
part a of this statement should be
read and understood together with the
detailed review in macroeconomic and
monetary developments released
yesterday by the reserve bank.

part a. monetary policy
i. the state of the economy
production (iip) recorded a growth of 17.6
per cent in december 2009, 16.7 per cent
in january 2010 and 15.1 per cent in
february 2010. the recovery has also
become more broad-based with 14 out of
17 industry groups recording accelerated
growth during april 2009-february 2010.
the sharp pick-up in the growth of the
capital goods sector, in double digits since
september 2009, points to the revival of
investment activity. after a continuous
decline for eleven months, imports
expanded by 2.6 per cent in november
2009, 32.4 per cent in december 2009,
35.5 per cent in january 2010 and
66.4 per cent in february 2010. the
acceleration in non-oil imports since
november 2009 further evidences
recovery in domestic demand. after
contracting for twelve straight months,
exports have turned around since october
2009 reflecting revival of external
demand. various lead indicators of service
sector activity also suggest increased
economic activity. on the whole, the
economic recovery, which began around
the second quarter of 2009-10, has since
shown sustained improvement.

global economy
5.
the global economy continues to
recover amidst ongoing policy support and
improving financial market conditions.
the recovery process is led by emes,
especially those in asia, as growth
remains weak in advanced economies.
the global economy continues to face
several challenges such as high levels
of unemployment, which are close to
10 per cent in the us and the euro area.
despite signs of renewed activity in
manufacturing and initial improvement in
retail sales, the prospects of economic
recovery in europe are clouded by the
acute fiscal strains in some countries.
6.
core measures of inflation in
major advanced economies are still
moderating as the output gap persists and
unemployment remains high. inflation
expectations also remain well-anchored.
in contrast, core measures of inflation in
emes, especially in asia, have been
rising. this has prompted central banks
in some emes to begin phasing out their
accommodative monetary policies.
domestic economy

9.
a sharp recovery of growth during
2009-10 despite the worst south-west
monsoon since 1972 attests to the
resilience of the indian economy. on
the demand side, the contribution of
various components to growth in 2009-10
was as follows: private consumption
(36 per cent), government consumption
(14 per cent), fixed investments
(26 per cent) and net exports (20 per cent).
the monetary and fiscal stimulus
measures initiated in the wake of the

7.
the reserve bank had projected
the real gdp growth for 2009-10 at 7.5
per cent. the advance estimates released
by the central statistical organisation
(cso) in early february 2010 placed
the real gdp growth during 2009-10 at
7.2 per cent. the final real gdp growth
for 2009-10 may settle between 7.2 and
7.5 per cent.
8.
the uptrend in industrial activity
continues. the index of industrial
2

global financial crisis played an important
role, first in mitigating the adverse impact
from contagion and then in ensuring that
the economy recovered quickly.

12.
growth in monetary and credit
aggregates during 2009-10 remained
broadly in line with the projections set out
in the third quarter review in january
2010. non-food bank credit expanded
steadily during the second half of the year.
consequently, the year-on-year non-food
credit growth recovered from its intra-year
low of 10.3 per cent in october 2009 to
16.9 per cent by march 2010. the increase
in bank credit was also supplemented by
higher flow of financial resources from
other sources. reserve bank’s estimates
show that the total flow of financial
resources from banks, domestic non-bank
and external sources to the commercial
sector during 2009-10 at rs.9,71,000
crore, was higher than the amount of
rs.8,34,000 crore in the previous year.

10.
however, the developments on
the inflation front are worrisome.
the headline inflation, as measured by
year-on-year variation in wholesale price
index (wpi), accelerated from 0.5 per cent
in september 2009 to 9.9 per cent in
march 2010, exceeding the reserve
bank’s baseline projection of
8.5 per cent for march 2010 set out in the
third quarter review. year-on-year wpi
non-food manufactured products (weight:
52.2 per cent) inflation, which was (-) 0.4
per cent in november 2009, turned
marginally positive to 0.7 per cent in
december 2009 and rose sharply
thereafter to 3.3 per cent in january 2010
and further to 4.7 per cent in march 2010.
year-on-year fuel price inflation also
surged from (-) 0.7 per cent in november
2009 to 5.9 per cent in december 2009,
to 8.1 per cent in january 2010 and further
to 12.7 per cent in march 2010. despite
some seasonal moderation, food price
inflation remains elevated.

13.
scheduled commercial banks
(scbs) raised their deposit rates by
25-50 basis points between february and
april 2010 so far, signalling a reversal in
the trend of reduction in deposit rates. on
the lending side, the benchmark prime
lending rates (bplrs) of scbs have
remained unchanged since july 2009
following reductions in the range of
25-100 basis points between march and
june 2009. however, data from select
banks suggest that the weighted average
yield on advances, which is a proxy
measure for effective lending rates, is
projected to decline from 10.8 per cent in
march 2009 to 10.1 per cent by march
2010. the base rate system of loan
pricing, which will replace the bplr
system with effect from july 1, 2010, is
expected to facilitate better pricing of
loans, enhance transparency in lending
rates and improve the assessment of
monetary policy transmission.

11.
clearly, wpi inflation is no longer
driven by supply side factors alone. the
contribution of non-food items to overall
wpi inflation, which was negative
at (-) 0.4 per cent in november 2009 rose
sharply to 53.3 per cent by march 2010.
consumer price index (cpi) based
measures of inflation were in the range of
14.9-16.9 per cent in january/february
2010. thus, inflationary pressures have
accentuated since the third quarter
review in january 2010. what was
initially a process driven by food prices
has now become more generalised.

of active liquidity management measures
such as front-loading of the borrowing
calendar, unwinding of securities under
the market stabilisation scheme (mss)
and open market operation (omo)
purchases.

14.
financial markets functioned
normally through the year. surplus
liquidity that prevailed throughout the
year declined towards the end of the year
consistent with the monetary policy
stance. the reserve bank absorbed about
rs.1,00,000 crore on a daily average basis
under the liquidity adjustment facility
(laf) during the current financial year up
to february 12, 2010, i.e., before the first
stage of increase in the cash reserve ratio
(crr) came into effect. during february
27- march 31, 2010, the average daily
absorption of surplus liquidity declined to
around rs. 38,200 crore reflecting the
increase in the crr, year-end advance tax
outflows and higher credit demand from
the private sector. however, as the overall
liquidity remained in surplus, overnight
interest rates generally stayed close to the
lower bound of the laf rate corridor.

17.
the union budget for 2010-11
has begun the process of fiscal
consolidation by budgeting lower fiscal
deficit (5.5 per cent of gdp in 2010-11 as
compared with 6.7 per cent in 2009-10)
and revenue deficit (4.0 per cent of gdp
in 2010-11 as compared with 5.3 per cent
in 2009-10). as a result, the net market
borrowing requirement of the central
government in 2010-11 is budgeted lower
at rs.3,45,010 crore as compared with that
in the previous year.
18.
historically, fiscal deficits have
been financed by a combination of
market borrowings and other sources.
however, in 2009-10 and 2010-11,
reliance on market borrowings for
financing the fiscal deficit increased in
relative terms. the large market
borrowing in 2009-10 was facilitated by
the unwinding of mss securities and
omo purchases, as a result of which fresh
issuance of securities constituted 63.0 per
cent of the total budgeted market
borrowings. however in 2010-11, almost
the entire budgeted borrowings will be
funded by fresh issuance of securities.
therefore, notwithstanding the lower
budgeted net borrowings, fresh issuance
of securities in 2010-11 will be
rs.3,42,300 crore, higher than the
corresponding figure of rs.2,51,000 crore
last year. the large government borrowing
in 2009-10 was also facilitated by sluggish
private credit demand and comfortable
liquidity conditions. however, going

15.
the large market borrowing by the
government put upward pressure on the
yields on government securities during
2009-10. however, this was contained by
active liquidity management by the
reserve bank. lower credit demand by
the private sector also cushioned the yield.
equity markets generally remained firm
during the year with intermittent
corrections in line with the global pattern.
resource mobilisation through public
issues increased sharply. housing prices
rebounded during 2009-10. according to
the reserve bank’s survey, they surpassed
their pre-crisis peak levels in mumbai.
16.
during 2009-10, the central
government raised rs.3,98,411 crore (net)
through the market borrowing programme
while the state governments mobilised
rs.1,14,883 crore (net). this large
borrowing was managed in a nondisruptive manner through a combination
4

forward, private credit demand is expected
to pick up further. meanwhile, inflationary
pressures have also made it imperative for
the reserve bank to absorb surplus
liquidity from the system. thus, managing
the borrowings of the government during
2010-11 will be a bigger challenge than it
was last year.

the corresponding period last year.
consequently, on a balance of payments
basis (i.e., excluding valuation effects),
foreign exchange reserves increased by
us$ 11 billion as against a decline of us$
20 billion during the corresponding period
a year ago. foreign exchange reserves
stood at us$ 279 billion as
on march 31, 2010. the six-currency
trade-based real effective exchange rate
(reer) (1993-94=100) appreciated by
15.5 per cent during 2009-10 up to
february as against 10.4 per cent
depreciation in the corresponding period
of the previous year.

19.
the current account deficit during
april-december 2009 was us$ 30 billion
as compared with us$ 28 billion for the
corresponding period of 2008. net capital
inflows at us$ 42 billion were also
substantially higher than us$ 7 billion in

ii. outlook and projections
global outlook
20.
in its world economic outlook
update for january 2010, the international
monetary fund (imf) projected
that global growth will recover from (-) 0.8
per cent in 2009 to 3.9 per cent in 2010
and further to 4.3 per cent in 2011.
organisation for economic co-operation
and development’s (oecd) composite
leading indicators (clis) in february
2010 continued to signal an improvement
in economic activity for the advanced
economies. three major factors that have
contributed to the improved global
outlook are the massive monetary and
fiscal support, improvement in confidence
and a strong recovery in emes.

commercial real estate is declining.
growth in the euro area, on a quarter-onquarter basis, was 0.1 per cent in q4 of
2009. it may remain moderate in 2010
because of the ongoing process of balance
sheet adjustment in various sectors,
dampened investment, low capacity
utilisation and low consumption. though
exports are improving and the decline in
business fixed investment is moderating,
several euro-zone governments are faced
with high and unsustainable fiscal
imbalances which could have implications
for medium and long-term interest rates.
in japan, improved prospects on account
of exports have been offset by the
levelling off of public investment and rise
in unemployment.

21.
us gdp rose by 5.6 per cent on
an annualised basis during q4 of 2009.
however, household spending remains
constrained by high unemployment at
9.7 per cent. though business fixed
investment is turning around and housing
starts are picking up, investment in

2009-10 to 119.8 in q1 of 2010-11, it was
much higher in comparison with the level
of 96.4 a year ago. the improved
performance of the industrial sector is also
reflected in the improved profitability in
the corporate sector. service sector
activities have shown buoyancy,
especially during the latter half of
2009-10. the leading indicators of various
sectors such as tourist arrivals,
commercial vehicles production and
traffic at major ports show significant
improvement. a sustained increase in bank
credit and in the financial resources raised
by the commercial sector from non-bank
sources also suggest that the recovery is
gaining momentum.

inflation
23.
globally, headline inflation rates
rose between november 2009 and january
2010, softened in february 2010 on
account of moderation of food, metal and
crude prices and again rose marginally in
some major economies in march 2010.
core inflation continued to decline in the
us on account of substantial resource
slack. inflation expectations in advanced
countries also remain stable. though
inflation has started rising in several
emes, india is a significant outlier with
inflation rates much higher than in other
emes.
domestic outlook
growth
24.
the indian economy is firmly on
the recovery path. exports have been
expanding since october 2009, a trend
that is expected to continue. the industrial
sector recovery is increasingly becoming
broad-based and is expected to take firmer
hold going forward on the back of rising
domestic and external demand.

26.
on balance, under the assumption
of a normal monsoon and sustenance of
good performance of the industrial and
services sectors on the back of rising
domestic and external demand, for policy
purposes the baseline projection of real
gdp growth for 2010-11 is placed at 8.0
per cent with an upside bias (chart 1).

25.
surveys generally support the
perception of a consolidating recovery.
according to the reserve bank’s quarterly
industrial outlook survey, although the

of seasonal moderation in food prices,
overall food inflation continues at an
elevated level. it is likely that structural
shortage of certain agricultural
commodities such as pulses, edible oils
and milk could reduce the pace of food
price moderation. second, the firming up
of global commodity prices poses upside
risks to inflation. third, the reserve
bank’s industrial outlook survey shows
that corporates are increasingly regaining
their pricing power in many sectors. as
the recovery gains further momentum,
the demand pressures are expected to
accentuate. fourth, the reserve bank’s
quarterly inflation expectations survey for
households indicates that household
inflation expectations have remained at an
elevated level.

firmed up in the second half of the year. it
accelerated from 1.5 per cent in october
2009 to 9.9 per cent by march 2010. the
deficient south-west monsoon rainfall
accentuated the pressure on food prices.
this, combined with the firming up of
global commodity prices from their low
levels in early 2009 and incipient demand
side pressures, led to acceleration in the
overall inflation rate – both of the wpi
and the cpis.
28.
the reserve bank’s baseline
projection of wpi inflation for march
2010 was 8.5 per cent. however, some
subsequent developments on both supply
and demand sides pushed up inflation.
enhancement of excise duty and
restoration of the basic customs duty on
crude petroleum and petroleum products
and the increase in prices of iron ore and
coal had a significant impact on wpi
inflation. in addition, demand side
pressures also re-emerged as reflected in
the sharp increase in non-food
manufactured products inflation from 0.7
per cent to 4.7 per cent between december
2009 and march 2010.

30.
going forward, three major
uncertainties cloud the outlook for
inflation. first, the prospects of the
monsoon in 2010-11 are not yet clear.
second, crude prices continue to be
volatile. third, there is evidence of
demand side pressures building up. on
balance, keeping in view domestic
demand-supply balance and the global
trend in commodity prices, the baseline
projection for wpi inflation for march
2011 is placed at 5.5 per cent (chart 2).

29.
there have been significant
changes in the drivers of inflation in recent
months. first, while there are some signs

it would be the endeavour of the
reserve bank to ensure price stability and
anchor inflation expectations. in pursuit
of these objectives, the reserve bank
will continue to monitor an array of
measures of inflation, both overall and
disaggregated components, in the context
of the evolving macroeconomic situation
to assess the underlying inflationary
pressures.

policy purposes, m3 growth for 2010-11
is placed at 17.0 per cent. consistent with
this, aggregate deposits of scbs are
projected to grow by 18.0 per cent. the
growth in non-food credit of scbs is
placed at 20.0 per cent. as always, these
numbers are provided as indicative
projections and not as targets.

32.
notwithstanding the current
inflation scenario, it is important to
recognise that in the last decade, the
average inflation rate, measured both in
terms of wpi and cpi, had moderated to
about 5 per cent from the historical trend
rate of about 7.5 per cent. against this
background, the conduct of monetary
policy will continue to condition and
contain perception of inflation in the range
of 4.0-4.5 per cent. this will be in line
with the medium-term objective of 3.0
per cent inflation consistent with india’s
broader integration into the global
economy.

35.
while the indicative projections of
growth and inflation for 2010-11 may
appear reassuring, the following major
downside risks to growth and upside risks
to inflation need to be recognised:

risk factors

33.
during 2009-10, money supply
(m 3) growth decelerated from over 20.0
per cent at the beginning of the financial
year to 16.4 per cent in february 2010
before increasing to 16.8 per cent by
march 2010, slightly above the reserve
bank’s indicative projection of 16.5
per cent. this was reflected in non-food
credit growth of 16.9 per cent, above the
indicative projection of 16.0 per cent.

first, uncertainty persists about the pace
and shape of global recovery. fiscal
stimulus measures played a major role in
the recovery process in many countries by
compensating for the fall in private
demand. private demand in major
advanced economies continues to be weak
due to high unemployment rates, weak
income growth and tight credit conditions.
there is a risk that once the impact of
public spending wanes, the recovery
process will be stalled. therefore, the
prospects of sustaining the recovery hinge
strongly on the revival of private
consumption and investment. while
recovery in india is expected to be driven
predominantly by domestic demand,
significant trade, financial and sentiment
linkages indicate that a sluggish and
uncertain global environment can
adversely impact the indian economy.

34.
keeping in view the need to
balance the resource demand to meet
credit offtake by the private sector and
government borrowings, monetary
projections have been made consistent
with the growth and inflation outlook. for

second, if the global recovery does gain
momentum, commodity and energy prices,
which have been on the rise during the last
one year, may harden further. increase in
global commodity prices could, therefore,
add to inflationary pressures.

monetary aggregates

8

markets, are getting increasingly
concerned about the external sector
dynamics.

third, from the perspective of both
domestic demand and inflation
management, the 2010 south-west
monsoon is a critical factor. the current
assessment of softening of domestic
inflation around mid-2010 is contingent
on a normal monsoon and moderation in
food prices. any unfavourable pattern in
spatial and temporal distribution of
rainfall could exacerbate food inflation.
in the current context, an unfavourable
monsoon could also impose a fiscal
burden and dampen rural consumer and
investment demand.

36.
our exchange rate policy is not
guided by a fixed or pre-announced target
or band. our policy has been to retain the
flexibility to intervene in the market to
manage excessive volatility and
disruptions to the macroeconomic
situation. recent experience has
underscored the issue of large and often
volatile capital flows influencing
exchange rate movements against the
grain of economic fundamentals and
current account balances. there is,
therefore, a need to be vigilant against the
build-up of sharp and volatile exchange
rate movements and its potentially
harmful impact on the real economy.

fourth, it is unlikely that the large
monetary expansion in advanced
economies will be unwound in the near
future. accommodative monetary policies
in the advanced economies, coupled with
better growth prospects in emes
including india, are expected to trigger
large capital flows into the emes. while
the absorptive capacity of the indian
economy has been increasing, excessive
flows pose a challenge for exchange rate
and monetary management. the rupee has
appreciated sharply in real terms over the
past one year. pressures from higher
capital flows combined with the prevailing
rate of inflation will only reinforce that
tendency. both exporters, whose prospects
are just beginning to turn, and producers,
who compete with imports in domestic

37.
the resumption of the process of
fiscal consolidation has been a significant
positive development. this will help avoid
crowding out of private sector credit
demand and facilitate better monetary
management. however, the overall size of
the government borrowing programme is
still very large and can exert pressure on
interest rates. going forward, fiscal
consolidation has to shift from one-off
gains to structural improvements on both
tax and expenditure sides, and focus
increasingly on the quality of fiscal
consolidation.

iii. the policy stance
economy and ensured that the economy
started recovering ahead of most other
economies. however, in view of the rising
food inflation and the risk of it impinging
on inflationary expectations, the reserve
bank embarked on the first phase of exit
from the expansionary monetary policy by

38.
in the wake of the global economic
crisis, the reserve bank pursued
an accommodative monetary policy
beginning mid-september 2008. this
policy instilled confidence in market
participants, mitigated the adverse impact
of the global financial crisis on the
9

facilities and restoring the statutory
liquidity ratio (slr) of scheduled
commercial banks to its pre-crisis level in
the second quarter review of october
2009.

can complicate the inflation outlook
and impair inflationary expectations,
particularly given the recent escalation in
the prices of non-food manufactured
items. despite the increase of 25 basis
points each in the repo rate and the reverse
repo rate, our real policy rates are still
negative. with the recovery now firmly in
place, we need to move in a calibrated
manner in the direction of normalising our
policy instruments.

39.
the process was carried forward
by the second phase of exit when the
reserve bank announced a 75 basis points
increase in the crr in the third quarter
review of january 2010. as inflation
continued to increase, driven significantly
by the prices of non-food manufactured
goods, and exceeded the reserve bank’s
baseline projection of 8.5 per cent for
march 2010 (made in the third quarter
review), the reserve bank responded
expeditiously with a mid-cycle increase
of 25 basis points each in the policy repo
rate and the reverse repo rate under the
laf on march 19, 2010.

second, inflationary pressures have
accentuated in the recent period. more
importantly, inflation, which was earlier
driven entirely by supply side factors, is
now getting increasingly generalised.
there is already some evidence that the
pricing power of corporates has returned.
with the growth expected to accelerate
further in the next year, capacity
constraints will re-emerge, which are
expected to exert further pressure on
prices. inflation expectations also remain
at an elevated level. there is, therefore, a
need to ensure that demand side inflation
does not become entrenched.

40.
the monetary policy response
in india since october 2009 has
been calibrated to india’s specific
macroeconomic conditions. accordingly,
our policy stance for 2010-11 has been
guided by the following three major
considerations:

third, notwithstanding lower budgeted
government borrowings in 2010-11 than
in the year before, fresh issuance of
securities will be 36.3 per cent higher than
in the previous year. this presents a
dilemma for the reserve bank. while
monetary policy considerations demand
that surplus liquidity should be absorbed,
debt management considerations warrant
supportive liquidity conditions. the
reserve bank, therefore, has to do a
fine balancing act and ensure that while
absorbing excess liquidity, the
government borrowing programme is not
hampered.

first, recovery is consolidating. the quick
rebound of growth during 2009-10 despite
failure of monsoon rainfall suggests that
the indian economy has become resilient.
growth in 2010-11 is projected to be
higher and more broad-based than in
2009-10. in its third quarter review in

part b. developmental and regulatory policies
51.
the global financial crisis has
underscored the importance of pursuing
financial sector policies in the broader
context of financial stability and to serve
the interests of the real economy. a major
lesson is that no indicator or action is
foolproof, which points to the need for
continuous monitoring, regular review of
processes, proactive oversight and
pre-emptive actions. thus, periodic
assessment of regulatory comforts and
effective supervision are critical elements
for developing the financial sector on a
sound footing.

maintain financial stability. this process
has now become more intensive with a
focus on drawing appropriate lessons from
the global financial crisis and putting in
place a regulatory regime that is alert to
possible build-up of financial imbalances.
the focus of the reserve bank’s
regulation will continue to be to improve
the efficiency of the banking sector
while maintaining financial stability.
simultaneously, it will vigorously pursue
the financial inclusion agenda to make
financial sector development more
inclusive.

52.
over the last several years, the
reserve bank has undertaken
wide-ranging financial sector reforms to
improve financial intermediation and

a synopsis of the action taken on
the past policy announcements together
with a list of fresh policy measures is set
out below.

i. financial stability
stability standpoint. the fsr observed
that the banks remained well-capitalised
with higher core capital and sustainable
financial leverage. further, stress tests for
credit and market risk confirmed banks’
resilience to withstand high stress. the
fsr also emphasised the need for
evolving a stronger supervisory regime for
systemically important non-deposit taking
non-banking financial companies
(nbfcs-nd-si) and strengthening the
monitoring and oversight framework for
systemically important financial
conglomerates. overall risk to financial
stability was found to be limited.
however, the recent financial turmoil has
clearly demonstrated that financial
stability cannot be taken for granted, and
that the maintenance of financial stability
requires constant vigilance, especially

financial stability report
54.
as announced in the annual policy
statement of april 2009, the reserve bank
established a financial stability unit in
august 2009 for carrying out periodic
stress testing and for preparing financial
stability reports.
55.
the first financial stability report
(fsr) was released on march 25,
2010. this report is an attempt at
institutionalising the focus on financial
stability and making it an integral part of
the policy framework. the first fsr
makes an assessment of the strength of the
financial sector, with particular focus on
banks, and has raised some concerns,
including rising inflation, high
government borrowings and likely surge
in capital flows, from the financial

during normal times to detect and mitigate
any incipient signs of instability. going

forward, the financial stability reports
will be published half-yearly.

ii. interest rate policy
group and the suggestions from various
stakeholders, the draft guidelines on base
rate were placed on the reserve bank’s
website in february 2010.

base rate: introduction
56.
as indicated in the annual policy
statement of april 2009, the reserve bank
constituted a working group on
benchmark prime lending rate
(chairman: shri deepak mohanty) to
review the present benchmark prime
lending rate (bplr) system and suggest
changes to make credit pricing more
transparent. the working group
submitted its report in october 2009 and
the same was placed on the reserve
bank’s website for public comments.
based on the recommendations of the

57.
in the light of the comments/
suggestions received, it has been decided
to mandate banks to switch over to the
system of base rate from july 1, 2010.
guidelines on the base rate system were
issued on april 9, 2010. it is expected that
the base rate system will facilitate better
pricing of loans, enhance transparency in
lending rates and improve the assessment
of transmission of monetary policy.

iii. financial markets

regulation
of
non-convertible
debentures (ncds) of maturity of less
than one year

interest rate futures
58.
the interest rate futures contract
on 10-year notional coupon bearing
government of india security was
introduced on august 31, 2009. based
on the market feedback and the
recommendations of the technical
advisory committee (tac) on the money,
foreign exchange and government
securities markets, it is proposed:
∑

59.
as indicated in the second quarter
review of october 2009, the draft
guidelines on the regulation of
non-convertible debentures (ncds)
of maturity of less than one year
were placed on the reserve bank’s
website on november 3, 2009 for
comments/feedback. the comments/
feedback received were examined and also
deliberated by the tac on the money,
foreign exchange and government
securities markets. accordingly, it is
proposed:

to introduce interest rate futures on
5-year and 2-year notional coupon
bearing securities and 91-day
treasury bills. the rbi-sebi
standing technical committee
will finalise the product design
and operational modalities for
introduction of these products on the
exchanges.

∑

13

to issue the final guidelines on
the issuance of ncds of maturity less
than one year by end-june 2010.

∑

introduction of credit default swaps
(cds)
60.
as indicated in the second quarter
review of october 2009, the reserve
bank constituted an internal working
group to finalise the operational
framework for introduction of plain
vanilla over-the-counter (otc) singlename cds for corporate bonds for
resident entities subject to appropriate
safeguards. the group is in the process
of finalising a framework suitable for the
indian market, based on consultations with
market participants/experts and study of
international experience. accordingly, it
is proposed:
∑

63.
the risk management and
operational guidelines will be finalised by
the rbi-sebi standing technical
committee.
separate trading for registered interest
and principal of securities (strips):
status
64.
as indicated in the annual policy
statement for 2009-10, the draft
guidelines on stripping/reconstitution of
government securities prepared in
consultation with market participants were
placed on the reserve bank’s website on
may 14, 2009 for comments and feedback.
taking into consideration the feedback
received on the draft guidelines, the final
guidelines on stripping/reconstitution of
government securities were issued on
march 25, 2010. the guidelines, which
came into effect from april 1, 2010, will
enable market participants to strip/
reconstitute eligible government of india
dated securities through the negotiated
dealing system (nds) subject to certain
terms and conditions.

to place the draft report of the internal
working group on the reserve
bank’s website by end-july 2010.

guidelines on forex derivatives
61.
as indicated in the second quarter
review of october 2009, the draft
guidelines on otc foreign exchange
derivatives were placed on the reserve
bank’s website on november 12, 2009 for
public comments. the feedback received
from stakeholders and industry
associations was discussed in the meeting
of the tac on the money, foreign
exchange and government securities
markets. on the basis of the discussions,
it is proposed:
∑

to permit the recognised stock
exchanges to introduce plain vanilla
currency options on spot us dollar/
rupee exchange rate for residents.

corporate bond market
65.
in the recent period, the reserve
bank initiated several measures to develop
the corporate bond market as detailed
below:

to issue final guidelines by end-june
2010.

introduction of exchange-traded
currency option contracts

(i) to facilitate settlement of secondary
market trades in corporate bonds
on a delivery versus payment-1
(dvp-1) basis on the real time gross
settlement
(rtgs)
system,
the national securities clearing
corporation limited (nsccl) and
the indian clearing corporation

62.
currently, residents in india are
permitted to trade in futures contracts in
four currency pairs on two recognised
stock exchanges. in order to expand the
menu of tools for hedging currency risk,
it has been decided:
14

years under the held to maturity
(htm) category.

limited (iccl) have been permitted
to maintain transitory pooling
accounts with the reserve bank.
further, guidelines have been issued
to all reserve bank regulated entities
to mandatorily clear and settle all
otc trades in corporate bonds using
the above arrangement with effect
from december 1, 2009.

investment
securities

unlisted

non-slr

67.
in terms of extant instructions,
banks’ investments in unlisted non-slr
securities should not exceed 10 per cent
of their total investments in non-slr
securities as on march 31 of the previous
year. since there is a time lag between
issuance and listing of security, banks may
not be able to participate in primary issues
of non-slr securities, which are proposed
to be listed but not listed at the time of
subscription. in view of the above, it is
proposed that:

(ii) to facilitate the development of an
active repo market in corporate bonds,
the guidelines for repo transactions in
corporate debt securities were issued
on january 8, 2010. the guidelines,
which came into force with effect
from march 1, 2010, will enable repo
in listed corporate debt securities
rated ‘aa’ or above. fixed income
money market and derivatives
association of india (fimmda) is
working on the development of
reporting platform and also on the
global master repo agreement to
operationalise the repo in corporate
bonds.

∑

investment in non-slr debt securities
(both primary and secondary market)
by banks where the security is
proposed to be listed on the
exchange(s) may be considered as
investment in listed security at the
time of making investment.

68.
if such security, however, is not
listed within the period specified, the same
will be reckoned for the 10 per cent limit
specified for unlisted non-slr securities.
in case such investment included under
unlisted non-slr securities lead to a
breach of the 10 per cent limit, the bank
would not be allowed to make further
investment in non-slr securities (both
primary and secondary market, including
unrated bonds issued for financing
infrastructure activities) till such time the
limit is reached.

non-slr bonds of companies engaged in
infrastructure: valuation
66.
at present, banks’ investments in
non-slr bonds are classified either under
held for trading (hft) or available for sale
(afs) category and subjected to ‘mark to
market’ requirements. considering that
the long-term bonds issued by companies
engaged in infrastructure activities are
generally held by banks for a long period
and not traded and also with a view to
incentivising banks to invest in such
bonds, it is proposed:
∑

in

financial market infrastructure
reporting platform for certificates of
deposit (cds) and commercial papers
(cps)

to allow banks to classify their
investments in non-slr bonds
issued by companies engaged in
infrastructure activities and having a
minimum residual maturity of seven

69.
although there is a large cd and
cp market, there is currently little
15

regulation, surveillance and transparency
purposes, it is necessary to extend the
existing reporting arrangement in respect
of irs to all otc interest rate and forex
derivatives. accordingly, it is proposed:

transparency in the secondary market
trades. in order to promote transparency
in the secondary market transactions for
cds and cps, it is proposed:
∑

to introduce a reporting platform for
all secondary market transactions in
cds and cps.

∑

70.
fimmda has been requested to
start work on developing a platform
similar to its existing platform for
corporate bonds. eventually, once the
reporting system stabilises, a settlement
mechanism similar to the one introduced
for the otc corporate bonds may be put
in place.
reporting
of
transactions

otc

to set up a working group consisting
of members of the reserve bank, the
ccil and market participants to work
out the modalities for an efficient,
single point reporting mechanism for
all otc interest rate and forex
derivative transactions.

revision of repo accounting: status
72.
as indicated in the annual policy
statement of april 2009, the revised
guidelines for accounting of repo/reverse
repo transactions were issued by the
reserve bank on march 23, 2010. the
revised accounting guidelines capture
the economic essence of repo as a
collateralised lending and borrowing
instrument and not as outright sale and
purchase. the revised accounting
guidelines have been made applicable to
market repo transactions with effect from
april 1, 2010. these accounting norms
will, however, not apply to repo/reverse
repo transactions conducted under the
liquidity adjustment facility (laf) with
the reserve bank.

derivative

71.
the issue of transparency and the
need for information repositories for
transactions in otc derivatives have
assumed sharper focus in the post-crisis
scenario. in india, centralised reporting of
otc trades in interest rate derivatives
[interest rate swap (irs)/forward rate
agreements (fras)] commenced in
august 2007 on the clearing corporation
of india limited (ccil) platform. to
capture the trade data pertaining to all
otc derivative transactions for

iv. credit delivery and financial inclusion
∑

credit flow to the mse sector
credit guarantee scheme for mses
73.
following the recommendations of
the working group (chairman: shri v. k.
sharma) on credit guarantee scheme of the
credit guarantee fund trust for micro
and small enterprises (cgftmse), it is
proposed:

to mandate banks not to insist on
collateral security in case of loans up
to rs.10 lakh as against the present
limit of rs.5 lakh extended to all units
of the micro and small enterprises
(mses) sector.

high level task force on msmes
74.
a high level task force was
constituted by the government of india
16

co-operative credit institutions
(chairman: prof.a.vaidyanathan) and in
consultation with the state governments,
the government of india had approved a
package for revival of the short-term
rural co-operative credit structure. as
envisaged in the package, so far 25 states
have entered into memoranda
of understanding (mou) with the
government of india and the national
bank for agriculture and rural
development (nabard). fourteen
states have made necessary amendments
to their respective co-operative societies
acts. as on december 31, 2009, an
aggregate amount of about rs.7,000 crore
was released by the nabard as
government of india’s share under the
package to primary agricultural credit
societies (pacs) in 11 states.

(chairman: shri t.k.a. nair) to consider
various issues raised by micro, small
and medium enterprises (msmes) and
draw up an agenda for action. the task
force submitted its report on january 30,
2010 to the government of india. the task
force recommended several measures
having a bearing on the functioning of
msmes, viz., credit, marketing, labour,
exit policy, infrastructure/technology/skill
development and taxation. in particular,
it recommended that: (i) all scheduled
commercial banks should achieve a 20 per
cent year-on-year growth in credit to
micro and small enterprises to ensure
enhanced credit flow; (ii) any shortfall in
the achievement of sub-target of 60 per
cent for lending to micro enterprises of
the total advances granted to the micro and
small enterprises, would also be taken into
account for the purpose of allocating
amounts for contribution to rural
infrastructure development fund (ridf)
or any other fund with other financial
institutions as specified by the reserve
bank, with effect from april 1, 2010; and
(iii) all scheduled commercial banks
should achieve a 15 per cent annual
growth in the number of micro enterprise
accounts.

financial inclusion through grass-root
co-operatives
77.
there is a need for better
understanding of the grass-root level
rural co-operatives, which can play a
more effective role as vehicles of
financial inclusion. besides, a large
number of pacs, large adivasi multipurpose co-operative societies (lamps)
and farmers’ service societies (fss), a
number of thrift and credit co-operative
societies have been set up under the
parallel self-reliant co-operative
societies acts in some states. there is a
need to understand the operations of
these co-operative societies with
reference to their membership profile,
management structure, range of services
being offered by them, savings mobilised
from members/non-members, percentage
of non-borrower members, credit
extended to tenant farmers, oral lessees
and agricultural labourers to appreciate

75.
banks are urged to keep in
view the recommendations made by the
task force and take effective steps to
increase the flow of credit to the mse
sector, particularly to micro enterprises.
the reserve bank will monitor the
performance of banks in this regard.
rural co-operative banks
revival of rural co-operative credit
structure
76.
based on the recommendations
of the task force on revival of rural
17

the strengths of the well-functioning
societies and their potential as an
effective vehicle of financial inclusion.
it is, therefore, proposed:
∑

over 2,000. the reserve bank will discuss
fips with individual banks and monitor
their implementation.
business correspondents: relaxations

to constitute a committee
comprising representatives from the
reserve bank, the nabard and a
few state governments to study the
functioning of well-run pacs,
lamps, fss and thrift and credit cooperative societies set up under the
parallel self-reliant co-operative
societies acts to gather information
on their working and assess their
potential to contribute to financial
inclusion.

79.
under the extant guidelines on the
business correspondent (bc) model, only
certain select categories of individuals are
permitted to be engaged as bcs. with a
view to providing more flexibility to
banks, it is proposed:
∑

financial inclusion plan for banks

to permit banks to engage any
individual, including those operating
common service centres (cscs), as
bc, subject to banks’ comfort level
and their carrying out suitable due
diligence.

80.
operational guidelines to banks in
this regard will be issued separately.

78.
with a view to increasing banking
penetration and promoting financial
inclusion, domestic commercial banks,
both in the public and private sectors, were
advised to take some specific actions.
first, banks were required to put in place
a board-approved financial inclusion
plan (fip) in order to roll them out over
the next three years and submit the same
to the reserve bank by march 2010.
banks were advised to devise fips
congruent with their business strategy and
to make it an integral part of their
corporate plans. the reserve bank has
deliberately not imposed a uniform model
so that each bank is able to build its own
strategy in line with its business model
and comparative advantage. second,
banks were required to include criteria on
financial inclusion in the performance
evaluation of their field staff. third, banks
were advised to draw up a roadmap by
march 2010 to provide banking services
in every village having a population of

81.
furthermore, a suggestion has
been received from various quarters to
consider ‘for profit’ companies (other than
nbfcs) as bcs of banks. keeping in view
the ramifications of the suggestion, it is
proposed:
∑

to prepare a discussion paper on the
subject which will be placed on the
reserve bank’s website. based on the
feedback, a final view will be taken
in the matter.

high level committee on lead bank
scheme
82.
on
the
basis
of
the
recommendations of the high level
committee on lead bank scheme
(chairperson: smt. usha thorat), the state
level bankers’ committee (slbc)
convenor banks were advised on
november 27, 2009 that the lead banks
should constitute a sub-committee of the
18

∑

district consultative committees (dccs)
to draw up a roadmap by march 2010 to
provide banking services through a
banking outlet in every village having a
population of over 2,000. such banking
services need not necessarily be extended
through a brick and mortar branch but
through any of the various forms of
information and communication
technology (ict)-based models, including
through business correspondents (bcs).
based on the other recommendations of
the committee, the lead banks/scheduled
commercial banks were advised on
march 2, 2010 to (i) strengthen various
fora under the lead bank scheme;
(ii) discuss specific issues enabling and
inhibiting financial inclusion in the slbc/
dcc machinery; (iii) set up separate
sub-committees to work intensively on
specific issues; and (iv) prepare district
credit plans/annual credit plans linked
with the business plans of the banks. for
this purpose, it is proposed:
∑

to expand the terms of reference of
the working group to also review the
pros and cons of inclusion of bank
lending to micro-finance institutions
(mfis) under priority sector lending.
the group is expected to submit its
report by end-june 2010.

urban co-operative banks
establishment
of
co-operative banks

new

urban

84.
taking into account the systemic
financial
health
of
urban
co-operative banks (ucbs), it was
decided in 2004 not to set up any new
ucbs. with a view to improving the
financial soundness of the ucb sector,
memoranda of understanding (mou) were
signed with all state governments.
following the consolidation, the financial
condition of the ucb sector has improved
considerably and ucbs have also been
allowed to enter into new areas of
business. with a view to increasing the
coverage of banking services amongst
local communities, it is proposed:

to put in place an appropriate
monitoring mechanism of the working
of the slbcs/dccs.

∑

priority sector lending certificates:
working group
83.
in pursuance of the announcement
made in the second quarter review of
october 2009, a working group on
introduction of priority sector lending
certificates (pslcs) (chairman:
shri v. k. sharma) was constituted by the
reserve bank in november 2009 to
examine the pros and cons of the
recommendation made by the committee
on financial sector reforms (chairman:
dr. raghuram g. rajan) relating to pslcs
and make suitable recommendations on its
introduction and their trading in the open
market. in this context, it is proposed:

to set up a committee comprising
all stakeholders for studying
the advisability of granting new
urban co-operative banking licences
under section 22 of the banking
regulation act, 1949 [as applicable
to co-operative societies (aacs)].

liberalisation of off-site atms by
ucbs
85.
under the extant policy of branch
authorisation, ucbs, which are
well-managed and meet the regulatory
criteria, are required to submit annual
business plans, based on which centres are
allotted to them according to their choice
for opening of branches. centres where
ucbs desire to open off-site atms are
19

to follow for their dealing with individual
customers.

also required to be included in their annual
business plan. in order to further improve
the banking infrastructure, it has been
decided to liberalise the approach to
setting up of off-site atms by ucbs.
accordingly, it is proposed:
∑

89.
however, within the domain of
necessary freedom to banks to choose
the types of services to be offered to the
customers and related costs, concerted
efforts need to be made to further
d e v e l o p a c r e d i b l e a n d e ff e c t i v e
f u n c t i o n a l s y s t e m o f a t t e n d i n g to
customer complaints. in particular,
banks’ internal structure needs to be
made functionally effective and scaled
up to attend to not only basic customer
needs, but the special needs of
disadvantaged groups such as
pensioners and small borrowers,
including farmers. though there exists
a tiered mechanism for customer
grievance redressal in the banks, its
e ff i c a c y i n t e r m s o f a t t e n d i n g t o
customer complaints is far from
satisfactory. taking into account all
these considerations, it is proposed:

to allow well-managed ucbs to set
up off-site atms without seeking
approval through the annual business
plans.

86.
detailed guidelines in this regard
will be issued by mid-may 2010.
customer service
87.
the issue of ‘treating customers
fairly’ is assuming critical importance as
the experience shows that consumer’s
interests are often not accorded full
protection and properly attended to.
customer service in the banking industry
is increasingly becoming important as
banks are privileged institutions and
banking is a special public utility service.
the reserve bank and the banking
ombudsman’s offices have been receiving
several complaints regarding levying of
excessive interest rates and charges on
certain loans and advances.
88.
the reserve bank has, over the
years, undertaken a number of initiatives
for ensuring fair treatment to customers.
this has taken the form of both regulatory
fiats (such as reining in of recovery agents,
introduction of comprehensive display
board, banking facilities for the visually
challenged, rationalisation of service
charges on collection of outstation
cheques and free use of atms) as also
moral suasion and class action. the code
of bank’s commitment to customers was
introduced in july 2006 to set a minimum
standard of banking practices for banks
20

∑

to set up a committee to look into
banking services rendered to retail
and small customers, including
pensioners. the committee will also
look into the system of grievance
redressal mechanism prevalent in
banks, its structure and efficacy, and
suggest measures for expeditious
resolution of complaints. the
committee will also examine the
international experiences in this
regard.

∑

to further strengthen the mechanism,
for implementing the reserve bank’s
guidelines on customer service,
through on-site and off-site
inspections.

∑

to require banks to devote exclusive
time in a board meeting once every
six months to review and deliberate
on customer service.

v. regulatory and supervisory measures for
commercial banks
implementation of enhancements and
revisions to basel-ii framework finalised
by the basel committee in july 2009.
accordingly, the reserve bank issued
guidelines to banks in february 2010.
these guidelines require banks to make
specified valuation adjustments for
various risks/costs in their portfolios
including derivatives, which are subject
to ‘mark to market’ requirement and also
for illiquidity of these positions. these
guidelines also permit banks to follow any
recognised models/methods for computing
the amount of valuation adjustment. in
order to ensure that a consistent
methodology is adopted by banks for the
purpose, it is proposed:

strengthening the resilience of the
banking sector
90.
in december 2009, the basel
committee on banking supervision
(bcbs) had issued two consultative
documents for public comments. the
document on ‘strengthening the
resilience of the banking sector’ contains
proposals for raising the quality,
consistency and transparency of the
capital base, enhancing risk coverage,
prescribing leverage ratio and containing
pro-cyclicality. the second document on
‘international framework for liquidity
risk measurement standards and
monitoring’ focuses on measures for
further elevating the resilience of
internationally active banks to liquidity
stress across the globe as well as
increasing international harmonisation of
liquidity risk supervision. the basel
committee is presently undertaking a
quantitative impact study (qis) of these
proposals. the qis will form the basis for
calibrating reforms proposed in the above
two documents to arrive at an appropriate
level and quality of capital and liquidity.
the fully calibrated set of standards is
expected to be developed by end-2010
with the aim of implementation by
end of 2012. ten large indian banks are
participating in the qis.

∑

to constitute a working group with
members from the reserve bank,
fimmda, the iba and a few banks
to recommend an appropriate
framework in this regard.

convergence of indian accounting
standards with international financial
reporting standards
92.
as part of the efforts to ensure
convergence of the indian accounting
standards (iass) with the international
financial reporting standards (ifrss),
the roadmap for banking companies and
non-banking financial companies
(nbfcs) has been finalised by the
ministry of corporate affairs in
consultation with the reserve bank. as
per the roadmap, all scheduled
commercial banks will convert their
opening balance sheet as at april 1, 2013
in compliance with the ifrs converged
iass.

working group on valuation
adjustment and treatment of illiquid
positions
91.
in the second quarter review of
october 2009, it was proposed to issue
appropriate guidelines to banks for
21

preparing banks and other entities to
adhere to the roadmap.

93.
however, with regard to ucbs and
nbfcs, a gradualist approach is
considered appropriate. the roadmap
envisages ucbs having net worth in
excess of rs. 300 crore and nbfcs which
are part of nse-nifty 50 and bse-sensex
30 as well as those nbfcs having net
worth in excess of rs.1,000 crore to
converge with ifrss in tandem with the
time schedule given for scheduled
commercial banks. ucbs having net
worth in excess of rs. 200 crore but not
exceeding rs. 300 crore and other listed
nbfcs as well as unlisted nbfcs having
a net worth in excess of rs. 500 crore shall
convert their opening balance sheets as on
april 1, 2014 in compliance with the ifrs
converged iass. remaining ucbs,
unlisted nbfcs not falling in the above
categories and regional rural banks
(rrbs) need to follow only the notified
iass which are not converged with ifrss.

infrastructure financing
95.
with a view to meeting the
increasing financing needs of
infrastructure development, the reserve
bank has taken a number of measures to
facilitate adequate flow of bank credit to
this sector. in order to give a further thrust
to infrastructure financing by banks, some
further measures are felt necessary.
96.
in terms of extant instructions,
rights, licenses and authorisations of
borrowers, charged to banks as collateral
in respect of project loans (including
infrastructure projects) are not eligible for
being reckoned as tangible security for the
purpose of classifying an advance as
secured loan. as toll collection rights and
annuities in the case of road/highway
projects confer certain material benefits
to lenders, it is proposed:

94.
considering the amount of work
involved in the convergence process, it is
expected that banks and other entities
concurrently initiate appropriate measures
to upgrade their skills, management
information system (mis) and information
technology (it) capabilities to manage the
complexities and challenges of ifrss. the
implementation poses additional
challenge as certain aspects of ifrss,
especially the standards on financial
instruments, are under review and would
take some time before they are finalised.
in order to facilitate smooth migration to
ifrss, it is proposed:
∑

to undertake a study of the
implications of the ifrss
convergence process and also to issue
operational guidelines as appropriate.

∑

to disseminate information through
learning programmes with a view to

∑

to treat annuities under build-operatetransfer (bot) model in respect of
road/highway projects and toll
collection rights, where there are
provisions to compensate the project
sponsor if a certain level of traffic is
not achieved, as tangible securities
subject to the condition that banks’
right to receive annuities and toll
collection rights is legally enforceable
and irrevocable.

97.
till june 2004, the reserve bank
had prescribed a limit on banks’ unsecured
exposures. as a step towards deregulation,
the above limit was withdrawn to enable
banks’ boards to formulate their own
policies on unsecured exposures. the
provisioning requirement for unsecured
sub-standard exposures, however, was
increased to 20 per cent consequent to the
22

withdrawal of limits on banks’ unsecured
exposures (the provisioning requirement
for secured sub-standard exposures stands
at 10 per cent). in view of certain
safeguards such as escrow accounts
available in respect of infrastructure
lending, it is proposed that:

the one-mode presence criterion. the
wos was to be treated on par with the
existing branches of foreign banks for
branch expansion in india. no foreign
bank, however, applied to establish itself
as a wos or to convert to a wos during
the first phase.

∑

99.
when the revision of presence of
foreign banks in india was due in april
2009, the global financial markets were
in turmoil and there were uncertainties
surrounding the financial strength of
banks around the world. accordingly, the
annual policy statement of april 2009
indicated the intent to continue with the
current policy and procedures governing
the presence of foreign banks in india and
to review its roadmap after due
consultation with the stakeholders once
there was greater clarity regarding
stability and recovery of the global
financial system.

infrastructure loan accounts classified
as sub-standard will attract a
provisioning of 15 per cent instead of
the current prescription of 20 per cent.
to avail of this benefit of lower
provisioning, banks should have in
place an appropriate mechanism to
escrow the cash flows and also have
a clear and legal first claim on such
cash flows.

presence of foreign banks
98.
in february 2005, the reserve
bank had released the ‘roadmap for
presence of foreign banks in india’ laying
out a two-track and gradualist approach
aimed at increasing the efficiency and
stability of the banking sector in india. the
first track was the consolidation of the
domestic banking system, both in the
private and public sectors, and the second
track was the gradual enhancement of
foreign banks in a synchronised manner.
the roadmap was divided into two phases,
the first phase spanning the period march
2005 – march 2009, and the second phase
beginning after a review of the experience
gained in the first phase. in the first phase,
foreign banks wishing to establish
presence in india for the first time could
either choose to operate through branch
presence or set up a 100 per cent
wholly-owned subsidiary (wos),
following the one-mode presence
criterion. foreign banks already operating
in india were also allowed to convert their
existing branches to wos while following

100. while global financial markets
have been improving, various
international fora have been engaged in
setting out policy frameworks
incorporating the lessons learnt from the
crisis. some of the lessons from crisis are
to avoid organisational structures which
become (i) too big to fail and (ii) too
complex to fail. furthermore, while there
is a realisation that as international
agreement on cross-border resolution
mechanism for internationally active
banks is not likely to be reached in the
near future, there is considerable merit
in subsidiarisation of significant
cross-border presence. apart from easing
the resolution process, this will also
provide greater regulatory control and
comfort to the host jurisdictions. drawing
lessons from the crisis, it is proposed:
∑

23

to prepare a discussion paper on the
mode of presence of foreign banks

conglomerates and better insulation of a
bank from the reputational and other risks
of the subsidiaries/affiliates within the
group. the committee on financial sector
assessment (cfsa), in its report issued
in march 2009, observed that given the
lack of clarity in the existing statutes
relating to the regulation and supervision
of financial holding companies, the
holding company structure as prevalent in
the us for financial conglomerates is not
currently in use in india. the committee
noted that the absence of the holding
company structure in financial
conglomerates exposes investors,
depositors and the parent company to
risks, strains the parent company’s ability
to fund its own core business and could
restrict the growth of the subsidiary
business. considering the complexity of
the issues involved and implications of the
bhc/fhc model for the financial system
in general and banking system in
particular, it is proposed:

through branch or wos by september
2010.
licensing of new banks
101. the finance minister, in his
budget speech on february 26, 2010
announced that the reserve bank
was considering giving some additional
banking licenses to private sector players.
nbfcs could also be considered,
if they meet the reserve bank’s
eligibility criteria. in line with the above
announcement, it is proposed:
∑

to prepare a discussion paper
marshalling the international
practices, the indian experience as
also the extant ownership and
governance (o&g) guidelines and
place it on the reserve bank’s
website by end-july 2010 for wider
comments and feedback.

102. thereafter, detailed discussions
will be held with all stakeholders on the
discussion paper and guidelines will be
finalised based on the feedback. all
applications received in this regard would
be referred to an external expert group for
examination and recommendations to the
reserve bank for granting licenses.

∑

introduction of bank holding

company (fhc) in india

to constitute a working group with
the representatives from the
government, the reserve bank, the
sebi, the irda and the iba to
recommend a roadmap for the
introduction of a holding company
structure together with the required
legislative amendment/framework.

conversion of term deposits, daily
deposits or recurring deposits for
reinvestment in term deposits

103. the reserve bank placed a
discussion paper on holding companies
in banking groups on its website in
august 2007 for public comments. the
feedback received on the discussion paper
underscored the need for introduction of
bank holding companies (bhcs)/financial
holding companies (fhcs) in india to
ensure an orderly growth of financial

104. as per extant guidelines, banks
should allow conversion of term deposits,
daily deposits or recurring deposits to
enable depositors to immediately reinvest
the amount lying in the aforesaid deposits
with the same bank in another term
deposit. banks are required to pay interest
in respect of such term deposits without
24

reducing the interest by way of penalty,
provided that the deposit remains with the
bank after reinvestment for a period longer
than the remaining period of the original
contract. on a review of the extant
regulatory norms and in order to facilitate
better asset-liability management (alm),
it is proposed:
∑

of the major objectives of srep is
to evaluate whether the capital maintained
by the bank is adequate keeping in
view its risk profile and to determine the
supervisory capital ratio (scr). the
scr would be determined for each bank
separately. under this framework,
the adequacy of the risk management
and internal control framework
of banks would be subjected to
in-depth assessment. in order to
strengthen the supervisory process, it is
proposed:

to permit banks to formulate their own
policies towards conversion of
deposits.

compensation practices
105. it was indicated in the second
quarter review of october 2009 that in
line with the steps taken by global
community, particularly the initiatives
taken by g-20 nations, the reserve bank
would issue guidelines to private sector
banks and foreign banks with regard to
sound compensation policy. accordingly,
it is proposed:
∑

∑

to implement the srep framework
for banks from the inspection cycle
2010-11 as an integral part of the
annual financial inspection (afi) of
banks.

cross-border supervision
108. as indicated in the mid-term
review of october 2008, an internal
working group (chairman: shri s.
karuppasamy) examined the legal
position on cross-border supervision
arrangements and also explored the
feasibility of executing memoranda of
understanding with overseas supervisors.
subsequent to the submission of the
recommendations of the group, the
reserve bank has comprehensively
reviewed its existing practices for
cross-border supervisory co-operation.
with a view to ensuring effective
cross-border supervision and supervisory
co-operation, it is proposed:

to issue comprehensive guidelines
based on financial stability board
(fsb) principles on sound
compensation practices by end-june
2010.

106. the guidelines will cover effective
governance of compensation, alignment of
compensation with prudent risk-taking
and disclosures for whole time directors
(wtds)/chief executive officers (ceos)
as well as risk takers of banks.
implementation of pillar 2 of basel ii
107. all commercial banks, including
foreign banks in india, migrated to
the basel ii framework by march 31,
2009. the reserve bank has developed
a framework to conduct the supervisory
review and evaluation process (srep)
in banks under pillar 2 of basel ii. one

∑

25

to enter into bilateral mou with
overseas supervisory authorities
within the existing legal provisions,
consistent with the basel committee
on banking supervision (bcbs)
principles.

information technology and related
issues: enhancement to the guidelines

from such transactions. accordingly, it is
proposed:

109. information technology (it) risk
assessment and management are required
to be made a part of the risk management
framework of a bank, while internal audit/
information system audit needs to
independently provide assurance that the
it-related processes and controls are
working as intended. given the increased
incidents of cyber frauds in banks in the
recent period, it is necessary to improve
controls and examine the need for a
pro-active fraud risk assessment and
management processes in commercial
banks. with the increase in transactions
in electronic mode, it is also critical to
examine the legal implications for banks
arising out of it-related legislations and
other legislations such as it act 2000,
it amendment act 2008 and prevention
of money laundering act, 2002 and also
steps that are required to be taken to
suitably mitigate the legal risks arising

∑

to set up a working group on
information security, electronic
banking, technology risk management,
and tackling cyber frauds.

credit information companies:
grant of certificate of registration
110. in april 2009, the reserve bank
had issued in-principle approval
to four entities to set up credit
information companies. out of
the four companies, experian credit
information company of india private
ltd. and equifax credit information
services private ltd. have been granted
certificate of registration (cor) to
commence the business of credit
information on february 17, 2010 and
march 26, 2010, respectively. the
applications of the remaining two
companies for grant of cor are under
consideration.

stakes in group companies and also do not
carry on any other financial activity [i.e.,
core investment companies (cics)]
justifiably deserve a differential treatment
in the regulatory prescription applicable
to nbfcs-nd-si. in order to rationalise
the policy approach for cics, and based
on feedback received from such
companies, it is proposed to:

core investment companies (cics):
regulatory framework
111. the regulatory framework for
nbfcs has evolved in the recent past with
particular focus on inter-connectedness
and systemic risk. under this approach,
access to public funds has been perceived
as a systemic issue necessitating close
regulation and monitoring of nbfcs,
including systemically important nondeposit taking nbfcs (nbfcs-nd-si).
however, companies which have their
assets predominantly as investments in
shares not for trading but for holding

∑

26

treat cics having an asset size of
rs.100 crore and above as
systemically important core
investment companies. such
companies will be required to register
with the reserve bank.

112. the cics fulfilling minimum
capital and leverage criteria will be given
exemption from maintenance of net owned
fund and exposure norms applicable to
nbfcs-nd-si. they would be required
to submit annual certificate from their
statutory auditors regarding compliance
with the prescribed norms. draft
guidelines will be placed on the reserve
bank's website by april 30, 2010 for
public comments.

functioning of scs/rcs, additional
disclosures relating to assets realised
during the year, value of financial
assets unresolved as at the end of
the year, value of srs pending
redemption, among others, are being
prescribed.
114. detailed guidelines will be issued
by april 30, 2010.
guidelines on change in or takeover of

securitisation companies/reconstruction
companies set up under the sarfaesi
act, 2002: changes in regulations

115. the draft guidelines on change in
or takeover of the management of the
business of the borrower by the scs/rcs
were placed on the reserve bank’s
website for public comments. the
guidelines define the eligibility conditions
and the grounds based on which scs/rcs
may exercise the powers. the guidelines
provide for setting up of an independent
advisory committee (iac) to evaluate
the proposals of the scs/rcs regarding
the change in or taking over of the
management of the business of the
borrowers. based on the feedback
received and recommendations of the
external advisory committee, it is
proposed:

113. the guidelines and instructions
issued to the securitisation companies/
reconstruction companies (scs/rcs)
have been reviewed by the reserve bank
in consultation with these companies.
accordingly, it is proposed to make
the following modifications to the
guidelines:
∑

scs/rcs can acquire the assets either
in their own books or directly in the
books of the trusts set up by them.

∑

the period for realisation of assets
acquired by scs/rcs can be extended
from five years to eight years by their
boards of directors, subject to certain
conditions. asset/security receipts
(srs), which remain unresolved/not
redeemed as at the end of five years
or eight years, as the case may be, will
henceforth be treated as loss assets.

∑

∑

∑

to issue the final guidelines by april

2009-12

it will be mandatory for scs/rcs
to invest an amount not less than
5 per cent of each class of srs issued
under a particular scheme and
continue to hold the investments till
the time all the srs issued under that
class are redeemed completely.

116. keeping in view the significant
developments in payment systems and the
reserve bank’s responsibility with regard
to regulation and supervision of payment
systems, the ‘vision document’ for the
period 2009-12 was released on february
16, 2010. the scope of the ‘vision
document’ has been enhanced to ensure

with a view to bringing transparency
and market discipline in the
27

that all the payment and settlement
systems operating in the country are safe,
secure, sound, efficient, accessible and
authorised.

organisation for operating and managing
retail payment systems, has the envisioned
role to look at future innovations in the
retail payment space in the country.
effective december 14, 2009, npci has
taken over operations of the national
financial switch (nfs) from institute for
development and research in b a n k i n g
technology (idrbt). npci is also
expected to take the lead role in rolling
out the proposed cts project at chennai.

membership to the committee on payment
and settlement systems
117. the committee on payment and
settlement systems (cpss), constituted
under the aegis of the bank for
international settlements (bis), was
recently broadened to include india and
also nine other countries as members. the
reserve bank is also represented on three
working groups of the cpss set up for
drawing up standards/guidelines towards
efficient functioning of the payment and
settlement systems and supporting market
infrastructure across the world.

phased discontinuation of high value
clearing
120. it has been the endeavour of the
reserve bank to migrate from paper-based
payments to electronic payment systems
by creating the appropriate technological
infrastructure. as a step towards
encouraging migration of paper-based
high value payments to more secure
electronic modes, it was decided
to discontinue high value clearing (hvc)
in a phased and non-disruptive manner by
march 31, 2010. this process has been
completed as per schedule.

standardisation of security features on
cheque forms
118. cheques continue to be a
predominant instrument for retail
payments. to act as a deterrent to cheque
frauds and to bring about uniformity
across cheques issued/used by the banking
industry, it was decided to examine the
need for standardisation of security
features on cheque forms. a working
group was accordingly constituted and
based on its recommendations and the
industry’s feedback, cheque truncation
system
(cts)–2010
standard
with benchmark specifications for
security features on cheques and field
placements on cheque forms has been
prescribed.

enhancements in national electronic
funds transfer system
121. to further strengthen the national
electronic funds transfer (neft) system
in terms of availability, convenience,
efficiency and speed, significant
enhancements were introduced in the
operational procedures and process flow,
effective march 1, 2010. these included:
(i) increasing the operating window by
two hours on weekdays and one hour on
saturdays; (ii) introducing the concept of
hourly settlements; (iii) shortening the
time window for return of uncredited
transactions; and (iv) enabling positive
confirmation to the remitter through sms

operationalisation of national payments
corporation of india
119. the
national
payments
corporation of india (npci), set up in
december 2008 as an umbrella
28

or e-mail about the time and date of actual
credit of funds to the beneficiary’s account
with the destination bank. the concept of
positive confirmation to the remitter is
perhaps unique across all retail electronic
payment systems world-wide.

125. to further encourage the
development of other mobile-based
products, non-bank entities were also
permitted in august 2009 to issue
mobile-based, semi-closed prepaid
payment instruments, up to rs.5,000.
non-bank entities can issue such
instruments for facilitating payment for
goods/services and m-commerce
transactions.

122. as at end-march 2010, over
66,500 branches of 95 banks had
participated in neft and the volume of
transactions processed increased with a
record volume of 8.3 million transactions
in march 2010.

126. the reserve bank believes that
given the penetration levels of mobile
telephony in india, this could become an
important medium for achieving financial
inclusion in the country. however, this
calls for focused efforts by the banks to
partner with mobile service providers.
co-operation rather than competition
between these two important stakeholders
is the critical need of the hour. recently,
an inter-ministerial group constituted by
the government of india, has made
important recommendations for financial
inclusion through a bank-led model using
the infrastructure already set up by mobile
service providers. the reserve bank is
examining the recommendations of the
group.

directions to intermediaries and payment
aggregators
123. the use of electronic/online
modes of payments for purchase of goods
and services and also for making payments
for other utilities is increasingly gaining
popularity in the country. the increase in
the electronic/online mode of payment
involves the use of intermediaries such as
aggregators and payment gateway service
providers. in order to ensure the safety of
such transactions, detailed guidelines were
issued in november 2009.
mobile banking in india
124. the use of mobile phone channels
for initiation and execution of banking
transactions has been gaining significance
the world over. the significance of this
channel has been recognised by the
reserve bank. accordingly, regulatory
guidelines for enabling mobile banking
were notified in october 2008. the
transaction limits were further relaxed in
december 2009. banks were also
permitted to enable small value
transactions up to rs.1,000 without
end-to-end encryption. currently, this
channel is used to settle on an average 1.9
lakh transactions of average value 12 crore
in a month.

automated data flow from banks
127. as the policy and decision-making
processes are becoming more information
intensive, it is imperative to ensure quality
of data and their timely submission.
with a view to ensuring accuracy and
integrity of data flow from the banking
system to the reserve bank, a core group
consisting of experts from banks, the
reserve bank, idrbt and the iba has
been constituted for preparing an approach
paper on automated data flow (a straightthrough-process) from the core banking
solution (cbs) or other it systems of
29

commercial banks to the reserve bank. it
is expected that the approach paper would
be ready for circulation among banks by
end-august 2010.

from the reserve bank and major
commercial banks has been constituted
for preparing the basic approach towards
a next generation rtgs system,
both from the business and it
perspective.

rtgs upgradation
128. the current rtgs system
has been in operation for nearly six
years and there is a need to initiate
steps for replacing it with a new
system having improved functionalities
in
view
of
advancement
in
technology. accordingly, a working
group comprising representatives
