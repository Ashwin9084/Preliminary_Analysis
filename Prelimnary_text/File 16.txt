january 24, 2006
statement by dr. y. venugopal reddy,
governor, reserve bank of india on the
third quarter review of annual monetary policy
for the year 2005-06
this review consists of three sections: i. assessment of macroeconomic and
monetary developments; ii. stance of monetary policy; and iii. monetary measures.
an analytical review of macroeconomic and monetary developments was issued, a
day in advance, as a supplement to this review, providing the necessary information
and technical analysis with the help of charts and tables.

i. assessment of macroeconomic and
monetary developments
domestic developments
macroeconomic activity has firmed up as evident from estimates of gross
domestic product (gdp) for the second quarter (q2 or july-september) of 2005-06
by the central statistical organisation showing real gdp growth at 8.1 per cent for
the first half of the year, one percentage point higher than in the first half of last year.
more recent data also suggest that growth is, by and large, well spread across
various sectors of the economy.
the progress of the north-east monsoon has been satisfactory, although
somewhat concentrated in a few regions. according to the india meteorological
department, cumulative rainfall up to december 31 was 10 per cent above normal
for the country as a whole with excess/normal rain in 17 out of the 36 meteorological
sub-divisions. the total water storage in the 76 major reservoirs in the country was
63 per cent of capacity at the full reservoir level up to january 13, 2006, higher than
43 per cent a year ago as well as the ten-year average of 50 per cent. these
conditions augur well for rabi production. the progress of rabi activity and advance
estimates of kharif production are encouraging. thus, the foodgrains production
target of 215 million tonnes is within striking range and sizeable year-on-year
increases are also anticipated in the production of non-food crops. accordingly, real
gdp originating from agriculture and allied activities is poised to show higher growth
in the second half of 2005-06 than 2.0 per cent estimated for the first half of the year.
the pick up in growth of real gdp originating in industry to 8.8 per cent in the
first half of the year as against 8.3 per cent in april-september, 2004 was led by an
expansion of 10.2 per cent in the manufacturing sector. in subsequent months,
industrial activity has remained resilient on the back of sustained growth in the
manufacturing sector, despite some slowdown in the performance of the
infrastructure industries. during april-november, 2005 the index of industrial
production (iip) rose by 8.3 per cent as against 8.6 per cent in the corresponding
period of the preceding year. manufacturing output recorded a growth of 9.4 per cent

as against 9.1 per cent a year ago. mining and quarrying and electricity generation
decelerated. the production of capital goods and consumer goods – both durable
and non-durable – recorded double-digit growth rates with the expansion of the
capital goods sector at its peak for april-november since 1997-98. while the
production of basic goods picked up, intermediate goods recorded a subdued
performance.
during april-november, 2005 the overall growth of infrastructure industries at
4.4 per cent was lower than 6.7 per cent a year ago. the slowdown was mainly on
account of a decline in the output of crude petroleum and petroleum refinery
products as well as deceleration in the production of coal and electricity. cement
production, however, has risen significantly reflecting increased demand from
housing and construction as well as exports. the moderate improvement that is
underway in the production of finished steel and electricity could, in the normal
circumstances, improve the prospects of infrastructure and the overall industrial
sector in the ensuing months.
the buoyancy in manufacturing activity has been well supported by export
demand across a wide spectrum of industries, expanding bank credit, rising capacity
utilisation/expansion, sustained corporate performance and growing business and
consumer confidence. the reserve bank’s industrial outlook survey reports an
improvement in overall business expectations in october-december, 2005 over the
previous quarter based on a more positive outlook on output growth, access to
working capital and finance requirements, exports and capacity utilisation. the
business expectations index was at its highest level in october-december, 2005
since the inception of the survey in 1998. surveys conducted by other agencies also
indicate similar improvements in business confidence for the second half of 2005-06
showing overall invigoration of the growth momentum.
during the first half of 2005-06, growth of the private corporate sector was
sustained, albeit with some signs of slowing down. year-on-year growth in sales
decelerated from an average of around 23.0 per cent in 2004-05 to 18.5 per cent in
the first quarter of 2005-06 and 16.4 per cent in the second quarter. the growth in
net profits, which was sustained above 45.0 per cent till the first quarter of 2005-06,
decelerated to 27.5 per cent in the second quarter and further to around 20.0 per
cent in the third quarter. while the slack in capacity has narrowed, corporates have
accumulated significant internal resources to support investment decisions already
taken. unlike in the mid-1990s when investments were undertaken in anticipation of
demand, it appears that investments are now driven by global competitiveness and
demand generated domestically. moreover, the impact of new technologies is
reflected in shortening of gestation lags in various industries. accordingly, the overall
outlook for the corporate sector continues to be encouraging.
real gdp originating in the services sector rose by 9.7 per cent in the first
half of 2005-06 as against 8.4 per cent a year ago, with all constituent sub-sectors
sharing this buoyancy. the growth of construction, up from 4.8 per cent in the first
half of 2004-05 to 7.6 per cent in april-september, 2005-06 is expected to pick up
further, supported by increasing cement and steel production. the growth of trade,
hotels, transport and restaurants, which rose from 11.9 per cent to 12.2 per cent,
would benefit in the coming months from the increase in sales of commercial
vehicles (11.4 per cent in april-november), railway freight revenue (9.5 per cent in
april-october), airline passengers at domestic terminals (22.5 per cent in apriloctober), cargo handled at major ports (11.7 per cent in april-october), foreign

tourist arrivals (12.7 per cent in april-october) and telephone connections (87.1 per
cent in april-october). financing, insurance, real estate and business services
posted a growth of 9.1 per cent in the first half of 2005-06 as against 6.2 per cent a
year ago. community, social and personal services had risen by 6.4 per cent in the
first half of 2005-06 as against 5.4 per cent a year ago. overall, the outlook for the
services sector is bright.
bank credit has expanded significantly reflecting, to a large extent, the
strengthening of economic activity. scheduled commercial banks’ credit increased by
23.3 per cent (rs.2,56,441 crore) during the year up to january 6, 2006 as
compared with 19.9 per cent (rs.1,67,041 crore), net of conversion, in the
corresponding period last year. due to lower procurement for public
distribution/stocking, food credit increased moderately by rs.1,979 crore as against
an increase of rs.9,098 crore a year ago. non-food credit increased by 24.0 per cent
(rs.2,54,462 crore) on top of the increase of 19.6 per cent (rs.1,57,943 crore), last
year, net of conversion. on a year-on-year basis, non-food credit growth at 32.0 per
cent as on january 6, 2006 was higher than 26.6 per cent, net of conversion, a year
ago.
banks’ non-food credit operations over the preceding two years point to some
shifts in the pattern of deployment. during 2005-06 (up to october), credit to industry
increased by 11.5 per cent. significant increases in credit off-take were recorded by
power, iron and steel, automobiles, chemical and chemical products, textiles, gems
and jewellery, petroleum, coal products and nuclear fuels, roads and ports and
engineering. bank credit to the services sector increased by as much as 20.7 per
cent, accounting for 58.7 per cent of the incremental non-food credit. the growth in
credit to the services sector was led by housing, commercial real estate and
personal loans which together accounted for over a third of incremental non-food
credit in 2005-06. credit to commercial real estate and personal loans have been
rising significantly above trend rates of growth. credit to agriculture has been
growing at over 39.1 per cent on a year-on-year basis since 2004-05, constituting
11.8 per cent of incremental non-food credit.
scheduled commercial banks’ investments in bonds/debentures/shares of
public sector undertakings and the private corporate sector, commercial paper (cp)
and other instruments declined by 15.4 per cent (rs.14,474 crore) up to january 6,
2006 as against a decline of 7.2 per cent (rs.6,404 crore), net of conversion, in the
corresponding period last year. despite this, the total flow of resources from
scheduled commercial banks to the commercial sector showed a significant increase
of 20.8 per cent (rs.2,39,988 crore) as compared with the increase of 16.9 per cent
(rs.1,51,539 crore), net of conversion, in the corresponding period last year. the
year-on-year growth in resource flow was also higher at 28.3 per cent as against
23.2 per cent, net of conversion, a year ago.
aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks rose by 14.1 per cent
(rs.2,39,442 crore) during 2005-06 up to january 6, 2006 as compared with an
increase of 10.0 per cent (rs.1,50,094 crore), net of conversion, in the
corresponding period of the previous year. on a year-on-year basis, the growth in
aggregate deposits was 17.0 per cent as compared with 14.5 per cent, net of
conversion. demand deposits rose faster by 30.3 per cent as against 19.8 per cent a
year ago while time deposits increased by 14.8 per cent, higher than 13.7 per cent,
net of conversion, last year.

money supply (m3) increased by 12.4 per cent (rs.2,80,483 crore) during
2005-06 up to january 6, 2006 as compared with 8.8 per cent (rs. 1,76,906 crore),
net of conversion, in the corresponding period last year. on a year-on-year basis
too, the growth in m3 was higher at 15.9 per cent than 13.5 per cent, net of
conversion, a year ago. the larger expansion of money supply in 2005-06 so far has
been driven mainly by the sharp increase in non-food credit.
reserve money increased by 13.2 per cent (rs.64,725 crore) during 2005-06
up to january 13, 2006 as against an increase of 5.9 per cent (rs.25,831 crore) in
the corresponding period last year. currency in circulation increased by 13.3 per
cent (rs.49,028 crore) as compared with 9.6 per cent (rs.31,556 crore). bankers’
deposits with the reserve bank increased by 15.2 per cent (rs.17,319 crore) as
compared with a decline of 4.8 per cent (rs.5,017 crore). as regards the sources of
reserve money, net rbi credit to the central government increased by rs.69,955
crore as against a decline of rs. 27,012 crore. the reserve bank’s net foreign
exchange assets (nfea) increased by rs.10,719 crore, adjusted for revaluation, as
compared with the increase of rs.60,875 crore in the corresponding period last year.
the ratio of nfea to currency declined from 166.2 per cent in march 2005 to 146.9
per cent by january 13, 2006. the year-on-year increase in reserve money was at
19.8 per cent as on january 13, 2006 as compared with 17.3 per cent a year ago.
total liquidity, as reflected in outstandings under liquidity adjustment facility
(laf), market stabilisation scheme (mss) and surplus cash balances of the central
government taken together, had risen to a daily average level of rs. 1,23,826 crore
in september from rs.1,18,044 crore in april 2005. sizeable shifts in liquidity
conditions characterised the third quarter of 2005-06. broadly, pressures on market
liquidity were partly frictional and arising from seasonal and transient factors
including the redemption of india millennium deposits (imd), and partly cyclical,
associated with the pick up in growth momentum and the induced demand for bank
credit. this warranted appropriate monetary operations to obviate wide fluctuations
in market rates and ensure reasonable stability consistent with the monetary policy
stance. in october, liquidity conditions firmed up with the onset of festival demand for
currency, superimposed upon sustained credit demand. accordingly, average
reverse repo levels under the laf declined in relation to the preceding month. with
resumption of the market borrowing programme of the central government under
the indicative calendar for the second half of the year, liquidity conditions tightened
further in november. there was a release of net liquidity of the order of rs.5,500
crore in november through mss redemptions as the reserve bank refrained from
fresh auctions under the scheme in the second half of the month. market conditions
improved subsequently and the reserve bank returned to absorption mode with a
steady build-up of reverse repos under the laf, including under the second laf.
thereafter, liquidity tightened again in the run-up to quarterly advance tax outflows in
the middle of december, the redemption of imd at the end of december and on
account of accretions to cash balances of the central government. declining reverse
repo levels were accompanied by repos from december 16, and generally there
were net injections of liquidity. there was a further unwinding of mss of the order of
rs.19,522 crore during december. on a review of liquidity conditions including the
imd redemption at the end of december 2005, the reserve bank announced
suspension of the issue of treasury bills and dated securities under the mss while
retaining the flexibility of conducting the auctions under the scheme from time to
time with sufficient notice to the market.

the outstanding balances under mss, which were at rs.65,481 crore at endmarch 2005, increased to rs.80,585 crore by september 2, 2005 when mss
securities worth rs.20,000 crore were redeemed. subsequently, outstanding
balances under mss reached another high of rs.71,600 crore in early-november
after which it declined in successive weeks to rs.40,028 crore by january 20, 2006
due to unwinding of securities under mss. the net absorption of liquidity under laf
was rs.19,330 crore at end-march 2005 and reached its peak of rs.51,390 crore by
september 5, 2005. subsequently, due to tightness in the market, the reserve bank
injected liquidity through repo operations on several occasions. as on january 20,
2006 the net injection of liquidity was of the order of rs.13,770 crore. during 200506 (up to january 18, 2006), the cash balances of the central government increased
by rs.11,864 crore. accordingly, the total liquidity overhang fell to an average level
of rs.94,585 crore in december, 2005 and declined further to rs.61,317 crore by
january 20, 2006. redemptions of the order of rs.10,028 crore are due under the
mss during the remaining part of the current financial year and, if there are no fresh
issues, the outstanding balances under the mss would amount to about rs.30,000
crore at the end of march, 2006.
as per the assurance given in the mid-term review, the reserve bank, in
close coordination with the state bank of india (sbi) and other market participants,
put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that the redemption of imd of
rs.33,000 crore or us $ 7.1 billion occurs without undue stress on the money,
foreign exchange and government securities markets. the entire foreign exchange
outgo was met by the reserve bank out of the foreign exchange reserves in two
tranches, i.e., us $ 5.1 billion on december 28 and us $ 2.0 billion on december 29,
2005. the sbi, on its part, undertook adequate steps to mobilise rupee resources to
buy foreign exchange from the reserve bank. in addition, the reserve bank’s
liquidity support through the laf (including the second laf) was also available to
overcome short-term residual mismatches in rupee funds. the smooth redemption of
imd reflects the increasing resilience, strength and maturity of financial markets
complemented by flexible operations of the reserve bank.
turning to the fiscal situation, the revenue deficit of the central government
at rs.87,181 crore during april-november, 2005 accounted for 91.5 per cent of the
budget estimates (be) for 2005-06 as compared with 97.1 per cent (rs.73,948 crore)
in the corresponding period of the previous year. the slower pace of growth in the
revenue deficit during the current year was enabled by the increase in tax revenue to
47.6 per cent of be from 45.6 per cent a year ago and containment of growth in
interest payments and subsidies. the gross fiscal deficit (gfd) was higher at
rs.1,12,949 crore or 74.7 per cent of the be as against 51.5 per cent (rs.70,717
crore) a year ago; however, adjusted for debt swap transactions, the gfd during
april-november 2004 was 74.8 per cent of be. the growth in the gfd during the
current financial year has been mainly due to rise in plan revenue expenditure and
non-plan grants to states and union territories.
as on january 20, 2006 the central government had completed net market
borrowings of rs.90,051 crore (81.7 per cent of the budgeted amount of rs 1,10,291
crore) and gross market borrowings of rs.1,49,682 crore (83.8 per cent of the
budgeted amount of rs.1,78,467 crore) under the borrowing programme for 200506. issuances of treasury bills and dated securities were mostly in accordance with
the semi-annual indicative calendars. all issuances, except one, were reissuances
reflecting efforts towards consolidation of public debt and imparting liquidity to the
government securities market. the weighted average yield on fresh borrowings

through dated securities rose to 7.29 per cent (up to january 20, 2006) from 6.11 per
cent in the corresponding period last year. the weighted average maturity of dated
securities of the central government issued during the current financial year so far
increased to 15.61 years from 13.84 years in the corresponding period last year.
during 2005-06, as against the net allocation of rs.18,271 crore (gross rs.24,546
crore) for their market borrowing programme, the state governments have raised
rs.9,910 crore (net) and rs.16,184 crore (gross) up to january 20, 2006.
during the current financial year, inflation measured by the wholesale price
index (wpi) on a year-on-year basis, softened from a peak of 6.0 per cent on april
23 to a trough of 3.3 per cent on august 27, 2005. between september 3 and
december 31, 2005, inflation moved in the range of 3.6-4.9 per cent before touching
4.2 per cent on january 7, 2006.
prices of primary articles (weight: 22.0 per cent) rose by 5.1 per cent as
against 1.5 per cent a year ago, mainly on account of the increase of 13.9 per cent in
the prices of fruits and vegetables as against an increase of 0.4 per cent a year ago.
prices of non-food articles and minerals increased by 0.8 per cent as compared with
the increase of 1.5 per cent last year. prices of manufactured products (weight: 63.8
per cent) rose by 2.5 per cent, lower than 5.8 per cent a year earlier. in the category
of manufactured products, declines in the prices of edible oil, oil cakes and basic
heavy organic chemicals softened the effects of sharp increases in the prices of tea
and coffee processing, wine industries and wood and wood products.
prices of the fuel, power, light and lubricants (fpll) group (weight: 14.2 per
cent) rose by 8.1 per cent as against 10.1 per cent a year ago. within the group, the
prices of mineral oils (weight: 6.99 per cent) increased by 12.7 per cent as against
14.8 per cent last year. although the international crude prices have receded from
record highs at end-august, incipient pressures persisted with the average
international crude price basket relevant to india ruling at about us $ 62 per barrel
on january 20, 2006. mineral oils contributed to nearly 36 per cent of inflation as on
january 7, 2006. excluding mineral oils, inflation would have been at 2.7 per cent.
excluding the fpll group, it would have been 2.5 per cent. on an average basis,
inflation was 4.7 per cent as on january 7, 2006 which was lower than 6.5 per cent a
year ago.
inflation, measured by the consumer price index (cpi) for industrial workers
on a year-on-year basis, was 5.3 per cent in november 2005 as against 4.2 per cent
a year ago. on an average basis, cpi inflation was at 4.1 per cent as compared with
3.8 per cent.
financial markets have remained generally stable although interest rates
firmed up in almost all segments. the call money rate increased from an average of
4.77 per cent in april, 2005 to 6.58 per cent in january, 2006 (up to january 20).
through october, call rates remained orderly and closely aligned with the laf
reverse repo rate. call rates started hardening in november and remained above the
repo rate during november 10-18. liquidity injections from the reserve bank calmed
the call money market and call rates ebbed to settle at around 5.4 per cent by the
end of the month. call rates began rising again from december 10 and generally
remained above the repo rate. the daily average turnover in the call money market
increased from rs.17,213 crore in april to rs.18,776 crore in january (up to january
20, 2006).

other market segments at the short end of the spectrum showed similar
movements during the current financial year. the market repo (outside the laf) rate
increased from 4.63 per cent to 6.10 per cent with an increase in daily volume from
rs.3,958 crore (one leg) to rs.6,440 crore (up to january 20, 2006). the average
daily volume of collateralised borrowing and lending obligation (cblo) increased
significantly from rs.5,185 crore to rs.13,090 crore along with an increase in the
cblo rate from 4.58 per cent to 6.03 per cent. the weighted average discount rate
on commercial paper (cp) of 61 to 90-day maturity increased from 5.80 per cent in
april 2005 to 7.04 per cent by mid-january 2006 and the outstanding amount rose
from rs.14,809 crore to rs.17,235 crore. the typical interest rate on 3-month
certificates of deposit (cds) increased from 5.87 per cent in april to 6.75 per cent by
end-december 2005, accompanied by a significant rise in outstanding amounts from
rs.14,975 crore to rs.32,806 crore.
in the government securities market, the 91-day and the 364-day treasury bill
rates increased from 5.12 per cent and 5.60 per cent in april 2005 to 6.19 per cent
and 6.30 per cent, respectively, in january 2006. the 182-day treasury bill rate
moved up from 5.21 per cent to 6.22 per cent during this period. the yield on
government securities with 1-year residual maturity in the secondary market
increased from 5.77 per cent in april 2005 to 6.34 per cent in january 2006. the
yield on government securities with 10-year and 20-year residual maturities,
however, declined from 7.35 per cent and 7.77 per cent to 7.13 per cent and 7.37
per cent, respectively. consequently, the yield spread between 10-year and 1-year
government securities came down from 158 basis points in april 2005 to 79 basis
points in january 2006. the yield spread between 20-year and 1-year government
securities also declined to 103 basis points from 200 basis points.
the interest rates on deposits of over one year maturity of public sector banks
(psbs) moved up from 5.25-6.50 per cent in april 2005 to 5.50-7.00 per cent in
january 2006. during the same period, the benchmark prime lending rates (bplrs)
of public sector banks, private sector banks and foreign banks remained unchanged
in the range of 10.25-11.25 per cent, 11.00-13.50 per cent and 10.00-14.50 per cent,
respectively. however, the median lending rates for term loans (at which maximum
business is contracted) in respect of some major psbs moved up to 8.00-12.25 per
cent in december 2005 as compared with 8.00-11.90 per cent in september 2005.
the equity market remained buoyant with corporates raising resources from
the domestic primary segment as well as international capital markets. the
secondary market witnessed strong rallies with intermittent corrections. the bse
sensex (1978-79=100) touched an all-time high of 9648 on january 4, 2006 driven
by investments by foreign institutional investors (fiis) and supported by robust
corporate earnings, favourable investment climate and a positive macroeconomic
and business outlook, before moving down to 9521 on january 20, 2006.
developments in the external sector
based on the trade data available from the director general of commercial
intelligence and statistics (dgci&s), merchandise export growth at 18.1 per cent in
us dollar terms during april-december, 2005 slowed down from 26.6 per cent in the
corresponding period of the previous year. the deceleration in export growth was
due to a slowdown in exports of engineering goods, textiles and clothing, and gems
and jewellery in an environment of strong domestic demand. the recent moderation
of export growth points to the urgency of a supportive policy environment for
strengthening export competitiveness such as the development of infrastructure and
simplification of procedures.

imports rose by 27.3 per cent as against 36.3 per cent a year ago. oil imports
recorded a growth of 45.3 per cent, marginally down from 45.7 per cent a year ago,
mainly reflecting the softening of international crude prices with the ‘indian basket’
edging down to us $ 55.1 per barrel in december. both imports and consumption of
petroleum products declined in volume terms. non-oil imports increased by 20.2 per
cent during april-december, 2005 on top of 32.9 per cent in the corresponding
period last year. non-oil non-gold imports rose by 30.8 per cent in april-october
2005 on top of 29.9 per cent a year ago. imports of capital goods increased by 32.2
per cent (28.6 per cent a year ago), driven mainly by electrical and non-electrical
machinery, transport equipment, project goods, metal manufactures and machine
tools. consequently, the overall trade deficit widened to us $ 29.8 billion, higher by
54.2 per cent than us $ 19.3 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year.
as per balance of payments (bop) data, the trade deficit during aprilseptember, 2005 widened to us $ 31.6 billion as compared with us $ 14.8 billion in
april-september 2004. invisible receipts rose by 53.0 per cent due to significant
growth in receipts from transportation, software exports and other professional and
business services. private transfers, comprising primarily remittances from indians
working overseas, remained sizeable at us $ 12.3 billion as compared with us $
10.2 billion in april-september 2004. invisible payments grew sharply (71.0 per cent)
on account of outbound tourist traffic, payments for transportation and business
services such as business and management consultancy, engineering, technical and
distribution services and dividend and profit payouts. as a result, the current account
deficit was placed at us $ 13.0 billion in april-september 2005 as against us $ 0.5
billion in april-september 2004.
capital flows remained buoyant in april-october, 2005. foreign direct
investment (fdi) picked up on sustained growth in industrial and service sector
activity and the positive investment climate. fdi inflows amounted to us $ 3.6 billion
in april-october, 2005 up from us $ 3.3 billion a year ago. outward fdi also
maintained the rising profile of recent years, reflecting the appetite of indian
companies for global expansion in terms of markets and resources. a turnaround in
fii inflows that occurred in june continued through 2005, on the back of strong
growth expectations and corporate performance. portfolio flows rose to us $ 4.8
billion from us $ 1.3 billion, mainly on account of net investment by fiis which went
up to us $ 3.4 billion from us $ 1.1 billion. portfolio investment by way of
adrs/gdrs also rose to us $ 1.4 billion from us $ 0.2 billion. net inflows under the
non-resident deposit schemes at us $ 231 million turned around during apriloctober, 2005 from net outflows of us $ 688 million during the corresponding period
last year. higher recourse to external commercial borrowings (ecbs) and short-term
credit was enabled by lower spreads on external borrowings and rising import
financing requirements.
india’s external debt rose by us $ 1.0 billion over end-march, 2005 to us $
124.3 billion at the end of september, 2005. the increase was mainly in the form of
ecbs and short-tem debt, attributable to financing requirements necessitated by the
large expansion in both oil and non-oil imports. accordingly, the ratio of short-term
debt to total debt increased marginally from 6.1 per cent at the end of march 2005 to
6.7 per cent at the end of september 2005.
net accretion to foreign exchange reserves during april-september, 2005 was
us $ 6.5 billion (excluding valuation), taking the outstanding foreign exchange

reserves to us $ 143.1 billion. inclusive of valuation, india’s foreign exchange
reserves declined by us $ 2.1 billion from us $ 141.5 billion at the end of march
2005 to us $ 139.4 billon as on january 13, 2006. excluding the one-off impact of
imd redemptions, the foreign exchange reserves would have shown an increase of
us $ 5.0 billion.
orderly conditions prevailed in the indian foreign exchange market with the
rupee exhibiting more flexible two-way movements. up to january 20, 2006 the
rupee appreciated by 5.6 per cent against the euro, by 4.1 per cent against the
pound sterling and by 5.4 per cent against the japanese yen but depreciated by
around 1.4 per cent against the us dollar.
developments in the global economy
global growth appears to have improved in the third quarter (q3) of 2005. the
firming up of global economic activity during the third quarter of 2005 and its
broadening ambit suggests that the global growth could reach a level higher than the
average for the period 1990-2004. for 2006, the international monetary fund (imf)
has projected world growth at 4.3 per cent with advanced economies growing by 2.7
per cent and emerging market and other developing economies growing by 6.1 per
cent.
in the us, real gdp rose by 3.7 per cent in q3 on a year-on-year basis on the
strength of business spending, with consumer confidence regaining much of the
ground lost after the august hurricanes. the merchandise trade deficit has improved
to us $ 64.2 billion in november. the us current account deficit narrowed in the
third quarter to 6.2 per cent of gdp. the easy financing of the current account deficit
reflected sustained foreign appetite for us assets. in the euro area, a recovery
seems to be setting in with real gdp up by 1.2 to 1.6 per cent in 2005. conditions for
emerging out of deflation steadily improved in japan with real gdp growth rising to
2.9 per cent in q3, driven mainly by domestic demand and supported by a rise in
bank lending. industrial production also rose by 1.4 per cent in november, increasing
for the fourth month in a row, combined with signs of higher employment. growth in
q3 remained robust in the developing countries led by china (9.4 per cent), hong
kong (8.2 per cent) and india (8.0 per cent). in russia and latin america, too,
growth has been buoyant, except for brazil where real gdp fell in q3 by 2.8 per
cent. high oil prices, domestic capacity constraints and some building up of
inflationary pressures continue to be seen as factors restraining growth for most
developing countries.
with the moderation in international crude prices since september, consumer
price inflation in the advanced economies has fallen in the fourth quarter of 2005. in
the us, consumer prices dipped by 0.1 per cent in december, leaving inflation for
2005 at 3.4 per cent. in the euro area too, inflation edged down to 2.4 per cent in
november from 2.5 per cent in the previous month. deflation continued in japan with
overall consumer prices falling by 0.8 per cent in november, the biggest drop in
three years. in major industrial countries, inflation appears to have been contained
and spillovers of oil prices into wage increases have been moderate. by and large,
price stability has been maintained in these countries in the face of the oil shock
although asset prices, especially house prices, remain a cause for concern in terms
of potential inflationary pressures and the repercussions on consumer spending and
financial sector balance sheets. on the other hand, inflation has risen in major
emerging market economies. besides elevated levels of oil prices, tight non-oil
commodity markets have imposed price pressures.

future spikes in crude oil prices continue to carry the major risk to prospects
of global growth and stability. while demand generally drove oil prices up in 2004,
the price increases in 2005 were also the result of supply disruptions, inadequate
investment as well as the reduction in world oil spare capacity which fell to its lowest
level in over three decades. world oil prices have climbed throughout 2005 despite
somewhat slower demand growth in both china and the united states. declines in
petroleum product prices (especially petrol and diesel) during october-november
due to mild weather in the northern hemisphere and ongoing hurricane recovery
efforts in the us have been followed by some firming up of prices since december
due to geopolitical factors. the average price of the indian basket of international
crude varieties (comprising brent and dubai fateh) ruled at around us $ 60.0 per
barrel in october-january 20, 3.8 per cent lower than in the preceding quarter but
41.5 per cent higher than a year ago.
the international pass-through of oil prices to domestic retail prices has been
varied across countries. while domestic retail prices (including tax) of petrol in
december 2005 increased on a year-on-year basis by 22.5 per cent (in us dollar
terms) in canada and 16.9 per cent in the us, they declined by 4.9 per cent in japan
and italy. similarly, diesel prices increased by 23.5 per cent in canada and 20.5 per
cent in the us while they declined by 4.5 per cent in france. comparatively, india’s
domestic retail prices of petrol and diesel (average of four metros) increased by 14.6
per cent and 13.0 per cent, respectively, by january, 2006. while international crude
prices
have
risen
by
69.0 per cent between march 2004 and december 2005, domestic prices of petrol
and diesel have increased by 34.0 per cent during this period; price of lpg
increased by 16.4 per cent but there has been no increase in the price of kerosene.
since the tax component in retail prices varies from country to country, it is more
appropriate to compare the position net of the tax component. the retail prices, net
of taxes, of petrol and diesel have increased across the board in the developed
world. while the increase in petrol prices ranged between 32.0 per cent in canada,
21.1 per cent in the us and 1.1 per cent in japan, that of diesel prices was between
29.0 per cent in canada, 25.9 per cent in the us and 3.3 per cent in france. prices
for crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas are projected to remain high
through 2006 because of continuing tightness in international supplies and
increasing demand. according to the world bank, a supply shock that reduces oil
deliveries by 2 million barrels per day could push prices up to above us $ 90 per
barrel, reducing global growth by 1.0 per cent and the growth of large low-income
economies by 1.7 per cent.
the financing of the large current account deficit of the us is increasingly
becoming a cause for concern. government saving has fallen in the us and japan
and household financial saving has virtually disappeared in countries with housing
booms. on the counterpart side, many emerging markets, particularly in asia, have
run current account surpluses resulting in build-up of international reserves. the us
current account deficit is projected by the oecd to exceed 7.0 per cent of gdp in
2007 with substantial surpluses elsewhere. such a configuration could increase the
probability of a disorderly unwinding of macro imbalances and disruptive movements
in major currencies.
within the mounting global imbalances, oil exporting countries are currently
running large current account surpluses, repaying debt, as in the case of russia, and
building up assets. oil exporting countries have been actively using their export

revenue to buy financial assets in various countries. thus, the rise in oil prices has
represented a sizeable redistribution of income from oil consumers to oil producers
which could have an impact on global demand and the future course of unwinding of
global imbalances.
the prospect of a faster pace of monetary tightening contributed to a sharp
drop in equity prices around the world in early october. equity markets rebounded
strongly since november, boosted by signs of still robust growth in the us as well as
announcements of mergers, share buybacks and dividend increases. japan
outperformed most other equity markets throughout this period. upward revisions in
policy rates had a surprisingly muted impact on the prices of emerging market
assets. emerging markets benefited from record inflows of foreign portfolio
investment in 2005. as concerns about slowing us growth eased, emerging markets
bounced back strongly from their late october lows. by late november, equity and
bond prices had returned to their end-september highs and had generally reached
record levels by early january 2006. equity markets have, however, weakened
overseas thereafter mainly on account of renewed firmness in global crude oil prices.
corporate credit default swap rates and bond spreads remained more or less
unchanged in october although they have widened significantly since november.
while long-term interest rates rose in many markets in september and october, they
retreated slightly in november, and at the end of december it was still unclear
whether the recent rise in yields would prove as ephemeral as previous increases.
the increase in longer-term yields mainly reflected upward revisions to interest rate
expectations over the near term. further, the potential for rising energy costs to add
to inflationary pressures was a key focus of investors’ attention. the rise in implied
volatility also reflected growing uncertainty about the economic outlook. during
december 27-30, 2005 yields on 10-year us treasuries fell briefly below those on
two-year notes for the first time since december 2000, inverting in intra-day trading
and signalling expectations that interest rates could fall in future that is generally
associated with weak growth. this inversion came as analysts were finally
anticipating an end to the current tightening cycle and a lower long-term risk
premium than in the past. in january 2006, however, the spread has turned positive
again. the us dollar appreciated by 3.5 per cent in trade-weighted terms during
2005 and a similar trend continued in january 2006.
of the major central banks, the us federal reserve has raised its policy rate
by 25 basis points each on thirteen occasions from 1.0 per cent in june 2004 to 4.25
per cent by december 2005 while recently providing indications of nearing the end of
the cycle of measured rise in the policy rate. the bank of england has kept its repo
rate unchanged at 4.50 per cent since august 2005 in response to slowing domestic
growth. the european central bank (ecb) has raised its policy rate by 25 basis
points in response to rising inflationary expectations, after holding it unchanged at
2.0 per cent since june 2003. monetary policy has been tightened in several
economies in emerging asia, primarily in response to higher fuel prices and to the
measured pace of policy tightening in the us. bank indonesia raised its policy rate
by 50 basis points to 12.75 per cent on december 6, 2005 which was the tenth
successive increase during the year. in thailand, the 14-day repurchase rate was
increased for the seventh time since january 2005 from 2.00 per cent to 4.25 per
cent on january 18, 2006. monetary authorities in singapore and hong kong raised
their policy rates by 187 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively, during the
year up to december. in malaysia, the policy rate was hiked to 3.0 per cent in endnovember, 2005. in emerging market economies in general, the direction of policy

change has been towards either tightening or withdrawal of the accommodative
stance.
overall assessment
on an overall assessment, the outlook for the indian economy has brightened
considerably in the first three quarters of 2005-06. inflation, although drifting from an
end-august trough, remains well within acceptable limits. proactive policy responses
have contributed to this congenial configuration of macroeconomic performance. the
reserve bank, on its part, has moved promptly to head off potential excess demand
pressures that typically manifest themselves in an expansionary phase of the growth
cycle. laf rates have been raised three times by 25 basis points each since october
2004 with a view to reining in excess liquidity from feeding into demand pressures. in
addition, concerns about the quality of credit growth have been underscored for
focused public attention. surveillance over exposure limits in the banking system in
respect of sensitive sectors such as equity markets has been stepped up. risk
weights for calculation of capital adequacy have been increased in respect of
housing and real estate. in addition, the reserve bank has instituted a pro-cyclical
provisioning policy. it has also set up a selective supervisory review for banks with
relatively risky profiles. it is hoped that these measures will extend the current
expansionary phase of the growth and credit cycles in india.
since the mid-term review of october 25, 2005 aggregate demand appears
to be on the upswing. both employment and salaries in the organised services sector
are rising. investment is picking up and consumer spending remains buoyant. the
demand for banks’ non-food credit is very strong. corporate performance continues
to be robust and based on sound fundamentals. asset prices – housing, equity,
bullion – have continued to accelerate. however, there is some moderation in the
growth of exports and industrial output. the deterioration in the performance of the
infrastructure industries could potentially impose a supply constraint. hence,
improvements in the availability and the quality of the physical infrastructure would
considerably ease the supply constraints on growth.
the global economy has turned out to be stronger and more resilient than
initially expected. when a fuller picture emerges, world gdp growth in 2005 could
well be higher than 4.3 per cent projected by the imf. this has been accompanied
by an acceleration in the growth of world trade. on the other hand, recent global
developments as described below have amplified the existing downside risks,
particularly for emerging economies like india.
first, international crude prices continue to remain the major risk to both
growth and inflation. geopolitical tensions threatening supply have not abated even
as the range of forecasts converges to an expansion in global demand for petroleum
products in 2006. international crude prices have been edging up in recent weeks
and are projected to remain at elevated levels through 2006. in this context, the
imminent possibility of higher orders of pass-through to consumer prices and second
order effects can assume the form of generalised price increases that could
adversely impact inflationary expectations.
second, rising asset prices in conditions of abundant liquidity pose a risk for
households’ balance sheets and indebtedness. consequently, policy authorities are
on guard against adverse effects on consumption spending while instituting
monetary policy actions, given the potential repercussions on asset prices. sudden

reversals in other asset prices such as gold and equity could also have
contractionary effects.
third, although inflation expectations have stabilised in the us, they appear to
be at elevated levels in some parts of the world, particularly among developing
countries.
fourth, the risks from currency movements have increased significantly with
the widely expected correction in the us dollar not materialising. notwithstanding a
current account deficit of us $ 195.8 billion in the third quarter of 2005, the us dollar
rose by 3.5 per cent in trade-weighted terms during the year. this is attributed to
strong appetite for us dollar denominated assets on the back of widening interest
rate differentials between the us and the rest of the world. while it is difficult to base
monetary policy action on the possibility of currency adjustments, authorities need to
be well prepared for such an eventuality. in the final analysis, these developments
have increased the uncertainty surrounding currency movements.
while policy responses to these developments have been varied in the
context of the country-specific situations, the general direction of policy actions has
been towards withdrawal of accommodation. there is also some consensus that the
extent of perseverance with this policy stance would be limited by reaching the
‘neutral’ rate of interest, i.e., the rate at which economic activity is neither spurred nor
retarded. there is also some agreement that the level of the neutral rate is currently
lower than indicated by historical experience. in view of evolving conditions and
assuming that the potential risks do not materialise, it is likely that the withdrawal of
accommodation in monetary policy will reach the somewhat ill-defined levels of the
neutral rate of interest sometime in 2006.
real gdp growth in india has averaged 8.0 per cent over the past nine
quarters. so far, growth has been led by manufacturing activity despite large gaps in
the infrastructure. accordingly, adequate investment in infrastructure holds the key
for pushing up the potential growth of the economy. along with reinforcing the signs
of consolidation in public finances that is underway, it is important, therefore, to step
up budgetary expenditures on the infrastructure sectors and improve the regulatory
environment for adequate resource flow to the private sector. improvement in gross
domestic saving, essential for maintaining the growth momentum with stability, is
contingent upon reduction in the revenue deficits of the centre and the states.
assuming that the global environment does not turn adverse, that there are no
unanticipated shocks, and that appropriate and timely policy initiatives are taken in
the agriculture, infrastructure and, above all, fiscal areas, real gdp growth could be
maintained in 2006-07 at a level close to those in 2004-05 and 2005-06.
inflation in india has been contained so far in spite of global developments,
particularly the elevated and volatile levels of international crude prices. at the
current juncture, the pass-through of international oil price increases to domestic
prices has been managed through burden-sharing/cross-subsidisation between oil
companies, the government and consumers. in the aggregate analysis, the passthrough remains incomplete in respect of lpg, kerosene and, to some extent, in
respect of petrol and diesel. assuming that current prices represent a permanent
component, the need to align with international prices and the probability being
assigned to higher crude prices in the year ahead imparts an upside risk to inflation
in 2006-07. the step up in credit growth, movement in asset prices and growth in
monetary aggregates pose further risks of potential inflationary pressures. aggregate

demand management will, thus, pose a challenge for which careful and continuous
vigil over domestic and global developments is warranted. globally, the uncertainties
surrounding currency movements, interest rate movements and oil prices are the key
risks to monetary policy objectives. the outlook for inflation in 2006-07 will depend
on the evolution of these risks and timely response of monetary policy, recognising
that the policy measures have a lagged effect. against this background, a policy
setting aimed at containing inflation in 2006-07 at the level not exceeding that in
2005-06 is appropriate. the overriding importance of maintaining well-anchored
inflation expectations is critical for sustaining the growth momentum and assuring
macroeconomic and financial stability.

ii. stance of monetary policy
the mid-term review of october 25, 2005 reaffirmed the stance of monetary
policy set out in the annual policy statement of april 29 while rebalancing the
priorities assigned to policy objectives in the context of the assessment of the
economy and, particularly, the outlook on inflation. in response to the risks that had
emerged – credit quality concerns, rising asset prices especially housing, high and
volatile international crude prices with a substantial part of the increase in crude
prices being regarded as permanent, the widening trade deficit and the upturn in the
international interest rate cycle – greater emphasis was placed on price stability.
consistent with this stance, the reserve bank committed to ensuring a conducive
interest rate environment and the provision of appropriate liquidity to meet genuine
credit needs of the economy for maintaining the growth momentum. the reserve
bank also stated that it would consider measures in a calibrated and prompt manner
to stabilise inflation expectations in response to evolving circumstances. stating that
without a policy response, it would be difficult to contain inflation within the projected
range of 5.0-5.5 per cent, the fixed reverse repo rate under the laf was increased
by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent while retaining the spread between reverse repo
and repo rates at 100 basis points.
macroeconomic and financial developments since then are in support of the
monetary policy stance. first, inflation expectations have stabilised in a manner
consistent with policy projections. appropriate timing of the pass-through of
international crude prices has significantly muted the second round effects of oil
price hikes anticipated earlier. demand pull factors have remained reasonable
though there has been a significant pick up in overall activity. excluding mineral oils,
inflation was 2.7 per cent, while the headline inflation was 4.2 per cent on january 7,
2006. the modest ebbing of crude prices from their highs in august-september and
the softening of global prices of agricultural products has also mitigated the
pressures from imported inflation. second, the widening of the trade deficit under the
impact of high international crude prices and buoyant industrial demand for imported
inputs has been financed by capital flows. the exchange rate of the rupee vis-à-vis
the us dollar has appreciated by about 2.0 per cent by mid-january 2006 since the
beginning of november 2005. third, appropriate and flexible liquidity management
by the reserve bank through the laf, mss and standing facilities under both
surplus and deficit conditions has calmed financial markets, enabling market
expectations about inflation and policy responses to evolve synchronously with the
policy stance. in the event, the overhang of liquidity has declined by rs.60,472 crore
between september 2005 and january 2006 from rs.1,23,826 crore to rs.63,354
crore.

in response to the needs of market participants, the reserve bank introduced
a second laf with effect from november 28, 2005 as an additional instrument to
fine-tune liquidity management. it has proved to be reasonably effective in
maintaining appropriate liquidity in the system, especially in the wake of the imd
redemption.
the baseline outlook on growth has further brightened in recent months. first,
apprehensions of monsoon stress have definitely subsided and the prospects for the
rabi crop are favourable at the current juncture. this has made the foodgrains target
set for the year as well as a return to trend growth of gdp originating in agriculture
realisable. second, overall industrial growth has been sustained by the strength of
manufacturing activity, notwithstanding the drag imposed by the infrastructure sector.
industrial performance has been amply supported by buoyant and broad-based bank
credit, high corporate profitability which has boosted internal funding for investment,
sustained export demand and business optimism. third, the all-round expansion of
the services sector has imbued confidence into aspirations of higher growth of the
economy, backed by rising international competitiveness. fourth, the reserve
bank’s liquidity management operations have contributed to stability in financial
markets and have also enabled a smooth switch in banks’ portfolios in favour of
commercial credit. fifth, international investor appetite for the indian economy has
strengthened, endorsing the improvement of the macroeconomic fundamentals. this
has found reflection in large portfolio flows as well as a sizeable increase in direct
investment flows and international bank lending to india. all these factors tend to
place an upside bias to growth prospects.
there are indications of a pick up in aggregate demand during the third
quarter of 2005-06. a number of surveys point to improvement in consumer and
business confidence. the strength of domestic demand is also evident in terms of
rising asset prices, sustained sales growth, growth in final output demand, surge in
indirect tax collections and stronger than anticipated expansion in monetary and
credit aggregates. the coincident growth of capital and consumer goods industries
has supported the absorption of final demand. the robust year-on-year non-food
credit growth, and particularly to industry, infrastructure and retail sectors, shows that
the expansion in demand is getting broad-based. overall aggregate demand has
been managed reasonably well in 2005-06 so far, facilitated by appropriate liquidity
management by the reserve bank and muted pressures from the fisc, given the
modest improvement evident in the centre’s finances. recent developments,
however, point to according high priority to aggregate demand conditions, especially
fiscal developments, warranting careful and continuous monitoring for the effective
conduct of monetary management.
while strong credit growth, which is well diversified, is a reflection of greater
credit penetration and investment activity, there are concerns about credit quality in
the expansion phase. the reserve bank has already announced some measures
and sensitised the banks in this regard. recent trends in credit growth warrant a
reiteration of these concerns. banks are urged to undertake a comprehensive review
of credit quality, including a segment-wise analysis of activities with special reference
to those sectors where credit is expanding rapidly.
in reviewing the monetary policy stance at this juncture, it may also be
appropriate to consider potential downside risks to the outlook. first, international
crude prices remain a potent threat to overall price stability. while the pass-through
of international crude prices has been managed well so far, further escalations could

immediately endanger the fragile balance that currently prevails between the fisc, oil
companies and consumers. second, portfolio switches and liquidity mismatches that
have emerged have produced sizeable volatility in reserve money with an upward
pressure on money supply, combined with a shortening of maturity of deposits in the
banking system. demand deposits have grown faster than time deposits and cds
have become an important source of funding for certain banks. these developments
warrant continuous and careful monitoring so as to be on guard against the incipient
build-up of potential demand pressures. third, the possible strain on credit quality
continues to be an area of concern especially in the context of ensuring financial
stability and thereby deriving synergies with macroeconomic and price stability.
fourth, the surge in imports has produced a sizeable expansion in the current
account deficit in the first half of 2005-06. in this context, it is important to keep a
continuous vigil on the external front and to ensure stable financing of the current
account deficit. fifth, in view of the upward pressures on aggregate demand
including pick up in investment activity, a reduction in the revenue deficit and further
improvement in the fiscal deficit will add comfort to macroeconomic management.
as mentioned in the last review, recent developments in the bop seem to
indicate that the indian economy has entered an expansionary phase of the business
cycle. the current account deficit of the order of us $ 13 billion in the first half of
2005-06 needs to be regarded as consistent with the scaling up of the growth path
that has occurred in the current financial year. underlying the widening of the
merchandise trade deficit is the sizeable growth in non-oil imports, emanating from
capital goods, export-related inputs and a range of intermediate goods including
fertiliser, non-ferrous metals and iron and steel. it needs to be noted that non-oil
imports have an intrinsic growth-linked character and the recent high growth in these
imports attests to the onset of a durable pick up in the economy. besides, the large
expansion in imports is also spurring a vigorous export growth. in this sense, the
merchandise trade deficit has acquired a growth-leading dimension and could be
seen as a positive development.
the appropriate level of the current account deficit (cad) is a dynamic
concept and has to be assessed over a medium-term perspective. the size of the
cad is a function of the underlying growth momentum in the economy – a faster
growing economy is likely to run a higher cad than one with relatively slower
growth. in recent years, there has been some acceleration in the growth of current
receipts within which growth rates of software earnings and a wide variety of
business services lend comfort. besides, private transfer receipts, comprising mainly
remittances from indians working abroad, seemed to have acquired a more enduring
character and have risen steadily to constitute around 3 per cent of gdp in recent
years. these factors strengthen the capability of the indian economy to manage
higher cads than what was considered sustainable in the past. net capital flows
have so far exceeded the cad requirements reflected in large accretions to the
reserves. during the first half of 2005-06, the cad has been financed by net capital
flows with us $ 6.5 billion added to the foreign exchange reserves. the current
widening of the cad essentially represents the simultaneous expression of the
impact of the crude oil prices and the pick up in domestic investment. it is expected
that the sizeable expansion in imports of capital goods and embodied technology will
further boost the competitiveness of india’s merchandise exports which hold the key
to the strength of the external sector. it is, however, necessary to closely monitor
export competitiveness and exercise continued vigil on external developments while
being ready to respond to any uncertainties and shocks.

taking into account the foregoing assessment of macroeconomic and
monetary conditions and near term prospects, for the purpose of monetary
management, (i) gdp growth in 2005-06 is placed in the range of 7.5-8.0 per cent
based on the current assessment of a pick up in agricultural output and in the
momentum in industrial and services sectors, and (ii) inflation is placed in the range
of 5.0-5.5 per cent as projected earlier. expansion in m3 is expected to be
significantly higher than 14.5 per cent projected in the annual policy statement of
april 29, 2005 and growth in aggregate deposits would also be sizeably higher than
rs.2,60,000 crore projected earlier. non-food bank credit including investments in
bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sector,
cp and others, is expected to be significantly higher than 19.0 per cent projected
earlier. it is necessary to take careful note of the potential upward bias in monetary
and credit aggregates for 2005-06, even while ensuring appropriate liquidity to
sustain the growth momentum.
the commitment to price and financial stability will require continuous and
careful monitoring of global developments, in particular, movements in international
interest rates and the ongoing adjustments of global imbalances, the international oil
price scenario, the booming levels of credit and asset market activity in india and the
rising trade and current account deficits. while prospects for growth have improved
in recent months, it is critical to ensure that these gains are neither dissipated by
inflationary pressures nor by any threat to financial stability. the reserve bank has
consistently emphasised the quality of credit while nurturing a buoyant growth in
non-food credit to support export and investment demand in the economy. while
domestic factors continue to dominate over external factors in the growth and
inflation outlook for the economy, at the current juncture there is a need to recognise
the growing impact of external conditions on the indian economy. while recognising
that the current configuration of macroeconomic and financial factors favour growth
with stability in india, it is important to extend these gains by continuing the greater
emphasis on price stability. the risks to inflation from both domestic and global
developments remain high, persisting well into 2006-07. in particular, the remaining
pass-through of international crude prices into domestic prices of lpg and kerosene
portends an upward bias to inflation in 2006-07.
indications of pick up in aggregate demand are getting stronger with some
manageable spill-over into the external sector in the form of widening trade and
current account deficits. it is important to respond in a timely and even pre-emptive
manner to these developments to ensure that generalised inflation spirals do not
develop in an environment of higher than anticipated expansion in money supply and
bank credit with large shifts in liquidity. a measured policy response at this juncture
would stabilise inflation expectations and prevent corrosive effects on growth. it
would also avert the compulsion of undertaking larger and more drastic adjustments
in the future, should the prevailing situation evolve in a manner that threatens
macroeconomic and price stability. the reserve bank would strive for maintaining
stable inflationary expectations and orderly financial markets while ensuring the
continuation of the positive investment climate. against this background, the stance
of monetary policy from time to time would depend on emerging demand and supply
factors, both domestically and globally, while taking into account the lagged effects
of monetary policy.
the reserve bank will continue to ensure that appropriate liquidity is
maintained in the system so that all genuine requirements of credit are met,
consistent with the objective of price and financial stability. towards this end, the

reserve bank will continue with its policy of active demand management of liquidity
through omo including mss, laf and crr, and use all the policy instruments at its
disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants.
in sum, based on an informed assessment of macroeconomic developments
including the outlook on growth and inflation in a forward looking manner, and
barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various
sectors of the economy, the overall stance of monetary policy at the current juncture
will be:
• to maintain the emphasis on price stability with a view to anchoring
inflationary expectations.
• to continue to support export and investment demand in the economy for
maintaining the growth momentum by ensuring a conducive interest rate
environment for macroeconomic, price and financial stability.
• to provide appropriate liquidity to meet genuine credit needs of the
economy with due emphasis on quality.
• to consider responses as appropriate to evolving circumstances.

iii. monetary measures
(a) bank rate
the bank rate has been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent.
(b) reverse repo rate
in view of the current macroeconomic and overall monetary conditions, it has
been decided:
•
to increase the fixed reverse repo rate under the liquidity adjustment
facility (laf) of the reserve bank by 25 basis points from 5.25 per cent
to 5.50 per cent, with immediate effect.
the repo rate will continue to be linked to the reverse repo rate. the spread
between the reverse repo rate and the repo rate has been retained at 100 basis
points, as at present. accordingly, the fixed repo rate under laf will be 6.50 per
cent, with immediate effect.
(c) cash reserve ratio
the cash reserve ratio (crr) of scheduled banks is currently at 5.0 per cent.

the crr to the statutory minimum level of 3.0 per cent, on a review of the current
liquidity situation, it is felt desirable to keep the present level of crr at 5.0 per cent
unchanged.
