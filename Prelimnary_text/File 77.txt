fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement, 2018-19
resolution of the monetary policy committee (mpc)
reserve bank of india
on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation
at its meeting today, the monetary policy committee (mpc) decided to:
• keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (laf) unchanged at
6.5 per cent.
consequently, the reverse repo rate under the laf remains at 6.25 per cent, and the
marginal standing facility (msf) rate and the bank rate at 6.75 per cent.
the decision of the mpc is consistent with the stance of calibrated tightening of monetary
policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer
price index (cpi) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting
growth. the main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.
assessment
2.
since the last mpc meeting in august 2018, global economic activity has remained
resilient in spite of ongoing trade tensions, but is becoming uneven and the outlook is
clouded by several uncertainties. among advanced economies (aes), the united states (us)
economy appeared to have sustained pace in q3:2018 as reflected in strong retail sales and
robust industrial activity. in the euro area, economic activity remained subdued due to overall
weak economic sentiment, weighed down mainly by political uncertainty. the japanese
economy has so far maintained the momentum of the previous quarter, buoyed by
recovering industrial production and strong business optimism.
3.
economic activity in major emerging market economies (emes) has been facing
headwinds from both global and country-specific factors. in china, industrial production
growth has moderated with slowing exports and the ongoing deleveraging of the financial
system weighing on growth prospects. the russian economy has been gathering steam with
the manufacturing sector turning around, and the employment scenario remaining upbeat on
rising oil prices. in brazil, economic activity is recovering from the setback in q2, supported
by improving business and consumer sentiment, though weak domestic demand and the
sluggish pace of recovery in manufacturing activity point to a slow revival. the south african
economy slipped into recession in q2:2018, pulled down by the negative contribution from
agriculture on account of a strong unfavourable base effect.
4.
growth in global trade is weakening as reflected in export orders and automobile
production and sales. crude oil prices eased during the first half of august on concerns of
reduced demand from emes due mainly to the spillover from country-specific turmoil, and
accentuated by rising supplies. however, prices rebounded on expectation of reduced

2
supplies due to sanctions on iran and falling us stockpiles. base metal prices witnessed
selling pressure in anticipation of weak demand from major economies. gold prices
continued to slide lower on a strong us dollar, though they recovered somewhat on safehaven demand from the mid-august lows. inflation remained firm in the us, reflecting
tightening labour market and elevated energy prices, while it persisted much below the
central bank’s target in japan. in the euro area, inflation pressures have been sustained by
elevated crude prices. inflation in many key emes has risen on surging crude prices and
currency depreciations, caused by a firm dollar and domestic factors.
5.
global financial markets continued to be affected by monetary policy stances in major
aes, the spreading of contagion risks from specific emes, and geopolitical developments.
among aes, equity markets in the us touched a new high, driven by technology stocks,
while in japan, they were boosted by the weak yen. in contrast, stock markets in the euro
area suffered losses on signs of a slowdown and budget concerns in some member states.
sharp sell-offs have occurred on waning appetite of foreign portfolio investors for eme
equities. the 10-year sovereign yield in the us has traded sideways, falling on dovish fed
guidance only to recover by end-september on robust economic data. among other aes,
bond yields in the euro area hardened in september on risk aversion following the sharp rise
in financial market volatility in august. in contrast, bond yields in japan moved in a narrow
range, driven by the central bank’s yield curve management policy. in most emes, yields
rose due to domestic factors and/or contagion effects from the stress in other emes. in
currency markets, the us dollar witnessed selling pressures since august on reduced
investor expectations of rate hikes by the us fed. however, it recovered in the last week of
september on a rate hike by the fed and strong economic data. the euro remained in
bearish territory due to fiscal risks in some member countries and expectations of weak
growth. eme currencies continued to depreciate against the us dollar.
6.
on the domestic front, real gross domestic product (gdp) growth surged to a ninequarter high of 8.2 per cent in q1:2018-19, extending the sequential acceleration to four
successive quarters. of the constituents, gross fixed capital formation (gfcf) expanded by
double digits for the second consecutive quarter, driven by the government’s focus on the
road sector and affordable housing. growth in private final consumption expenditure (pfce)
accelerated to 8.6 per cent, reflecting rising rural and urban spending, supported by retail
credit growth. however, government final consumption expenditure (gfce) decelerated,
largely due to a high base. the growth of exports of goods and services jumped to 12.7 per
cent, powered by non-oil exports on the back of strong global demand. in spite of import
growth continuing to surge, high exports growth helped reduce the drag from net exports on
aggregate demand.
7.
on the supply side, growth of gross value added (gva) at basic prices accelerated in
q1, underpinned by double-digit expansion in manufacturing activity which was robust and
generalised across firm sizes. agricultural growth also picked up, supported by robust growth
in production of rice, pulses and coarse cereals alongside a sustained expansion in livestock
products, forestry and fisheries. in contrast, services sector growth moderated somewhat,
largely on account of a high base. construction activity, however, maintained strong pace for
the second consecutive quarter.
8.
the fourth advance estimates of agricultural production for 2017-18 released in
august placed foodgrains production at a high of 284.8 million tonnes, 1.9 per cent higher
than the third advance estimates (released in may 2018) and 3.5 per cent higher than the
final estimates for the previous year. the progress of the south-west monsoon has been
marked by uneven spatial and temporal distribution, with an overall deficit of 9 per cent in
precipitation. however, the first advance estimates of production of major kharif crops for
2018-19 have placed foodgrains production at 141.6 million tonnes, 0.6 per cent higher than
last year’s level. the live storage in major reservoirs (as on september 27) rose to 76 per
cent of the full capacity, which was 17 per cent higher than last year and 5 per cent higher
than the average of the last 10 years. this bodes well for the rabi sowing season.

9.
industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (iip), accelerated in
june-july 2018 on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, underpinned mainly by high growth in
consumer durables, notably two-wheelers, readymade garments, stainless steel utensils,
auto components and spares, and accessories. growth in consumer non-durables also
accelerated in july. the infrastructure and construction sector continued to show solid
growth. primary goods growth accelerated, driven by mining, electricity and petroleum
refinery products. growth in capital goods production spiked in june, but decelerated sharply
in july. the output of eight core industries growth remained strong in july, driven by coal,
petroleum refinery products, steel and cement, but moderated in august. capacity utilisation
(cu) declined from 75.2 per cent in q4:2017-18 to 73.8 per cent in q1:2018-19, while
seasonally adjusted cu increased by 1.8 percentage points to the long-term average of 74.9
per cent. based on the reserve bank’s business expectations index (bei), the assessment
for q2:2018-19 improved, led by enhanced production, order books, exports and capacity
utilisation. the august and september manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (pmi)
remained in expansion zone; the september print rebounded close to the july level
confirming robustness of manufacturing activity.
10.
high-frequency indicators of services in july and august present a mixed picture.
indicators of rural demand, viz., growth in tractor and two-wheeler sales, slowed down.
passenger vehicle sales, an indicator of urban demand, declined possibly due to rising fuel
prices. however, growth in air passenger traffic – another indicator of urban demand –
remained robust. transportation sector indicators, viz., commercial vehicle sales and port
cargo, expanded at an accelerated pace. steel consumption and cement production,
indicators of construction activity, showed strong growth. the services pmi remained in
expansion zone in august and september, though it decelerated from july, with slower
expansion in new business and employment.
11.
retail inflation, measured by the y-o-y change in the cpi, fell from 4.9 per cent in
june to 3.7 per cent in august, dragged down by a decline in food inflation. some softening
of inflation in items other than food and fuel also contributed to the decline. adjusting for the
estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (hra) for central government
employees, headline inflation was at 3.4 per cent.
12.
inflation in the food and beverages group declined sharply in the absence of seasonal
uptick in prices of fruits and vegetables. of the three key vegetables, the prices of tomatoes
declined due to strong mandi arrivals, while those of onions and potatoes remained muted.
continued deflation in prices of pulses and sugar accentuated the decline in food inflation.
inflation in other items of food – cereals, meat and fish, milk, spices and non-alcoholic
beverages – remained benign.
13.
inflation in the fuel and light group continued to rise on the back of a significant
increase in liquefied petroleum gas prices, tracking international product prices. kerosene
prices rose as oil marketing companies reduced subsidies in a calibrated manner. while
remaining elevated, cpi inflation excluding food and fuel moderated due to softening in
inflation in housing; pan, tobacco and intoxicants; personal care; and transportation.
14.
while the september round of the reserve bank’s survey of households reported a
sharp uptick of 50 basis points in three-month ahead inflation expectations over the last
round, one-year ahead expectations moderated by 30 basis points. inflation expectations for
both input prices and selling prices of manufacturing firms, polled by the reserve bank’s
industrial outlook survey, firmed up in q2:2018-19. the manufacturing and services pmis
also reported an increase in input costs and selling prices in q2, reflecting a pass-through of
higher costs to clients. on the other hand, growth in wages in the rural and organised
manufacturing sectors remained contained.
15.
systemic liquidity alternated between surplus and deficit during august-september
2018, reflecting the combined impact of expansion of currency in circulation, reserve bank’s
forex operations and movements in government cash balances. from a daily net average
surplus of ₹ 201 billion during august 1-19, 2018, liquidity moved into deficit during august

4
20-30. after turning into surplus during august 31-september 10 due to increased
government spending, the system again moved into deficit during september 11-29 on the
back of an increase in government cash balances and reserve bank’s forex interventions.
based on an assessment of the evolving liquidity conditions, the reserve bank conducted
two open market purchase operations in the second half of september to inject ₹ 200 billion
of durable liquidity. laf operations absorbed, on a daily net average basis, ₹ 30 billion in
august, but injected ₹406 billion in september. the weighted average call rate (wacr), on
an average, traded below the repo rate by 15 basis points (bps) in august and by 4 bps in
september.
16.
exports maintained double digit growth in july and august 2018, driven mainly by
petroleum products (which benefitted from elevated crude oil prices), engineering goods,
gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. however, imports grew
faster than exports, reflecting not only a higher oil import bill, but also higher imports of gold,
coal, electronic goods and machinery. this led to a widening of the trade deficit to us$ 35.3
billion in july-august 2018 from us$ 24.6 billion a year ago over and above the expansion in
q1:2018-19. however, higher net services receipts and private transfer receipts helped
contain the current account deficit to 2.4 per cent of gdp in q1:2018-19 from 2.5 per cent a
year ago. on the financing side, net foreign direct investment (fdi) flows improved in apriljuly 2018. by contrast, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in both the equity and
debt segments so far on a cumulative basis in 2018-19 due to higher us interest rates, riskoff sentiment in emes and escalation of trade wars. india’s foreign exchange reserves were
at us$ 400.5 billion on september 28, 2018.
outlook
17.
in the third bi-monthly resolution of august 2018, cpi inflation was projected at 4.6
per cent in q2:2018-19, 4.8 per cent in h2 and 5.0 per cent in q1:2019-20, with risks evenly
balanced. excluding the hra impact, cpi inflation was projected at 4.4 per cent in q2:201819, 4.7-4.8 per cent in h2 and 5.0 per cent in q1:2019-20. actual inflation outcomes,
especially in august, were below projections as the expected seasonal increase in food
prices did not materialise and inflation excluding food and fuel moderated.
18.
going forward, the inflation outlook is expected to be influenced by several factors.
first, food inflation has remained unusually benign, which imparts a downward bias to its
trajectory in the second half of the year. inflation in key food items such as pulses, edible
oils, sugar, fruits and vegetables remains exceptionally soft at this juncture. the risk to food
inflation from spatially and temporally uneven rainfall is also mitigated, as confirmed by the
first advance estimates that have placed production of major kharif crops for 2018-19 higher
than last year’s record. an estimate of the impact of an increase in minimum support prices
(msps) announced in july has been factored in the baseline projections. secondly, the price
of the indian basket of crude oil has increased sharply, by us$ 13 a barrel, since the last
resolution. thirdly, international financial markets remained volatile with eme currencies
depreciating significantly. finally, the hra effect came off its peak in june and is dissipating
gradually on expected lines. taking all these factors into consideration, inflation is projected
at 4.0 per cent in q2:2018-19, 3.9-4.5 per cent in h2 and 4.8 per cent in q1:2019-20, with
risks somewhat to the upside (chart 1). excluding the hra impact, cpi inflation is projected
at 3.7 per cent in q2:2018-19, 3.8 - 4.5 per cent in h2 and 4.8 per cent in q1:2019-20.
19.
turning to the growth outlook, the gdp print of q1:2018-19 was significantly higher
than that projected in the august resolution. private consumption has remained robust and is
likely to be sustained even as the recent rise in oil prices may have a bearing on disposable
incomes. improving capacity utilisation, larger fdi inflows and increased financial resources
to the corporate sector augur well for investment activity. however, both global and domestic
financial conditions have tightened, which may dampen investment activity. rising crude oil
prices and other input costs may also drag down investment activity by denting profit margins
of corporates. this adverse impact will be alleviated to the extent corporates are able to pass
on increases in their input costs. uncertainty surrounds the outlook for exports. tailwinds
from the recent depreciation of the rupee could be muted by the slowing down of global trade

5
and the escalating tariff war. based on an overall assessment, gdp growth projection for
2018-19 is retained at 7.4 per cent as in the august resolution (7.4 per cent in q2 and 7.1-7.3
per cent in h2), with risks broadly balanced; the path in the august resolution was 7.5 per
cent in q2:2018-19 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in h2. gdp growth for q1:2019-20 is now projected
marginally lower at 7.4 per cent as against 7.5 per cent in the august resolution, mainly due
to the strong base effect (chart 2).

20.
while the projections of inflation for 2018-19 and q1:2019-20 have been revised
downwards from the august resolution, its trajectory is projected to rise above the august
2018 print. the outlook is clouded with several uncertainties. first, the government
announced in september measures aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to farmers for
their produce, although uncertainty continues about their exact impact on food prices.
secondly, oil prices remain vulnerable to further upside pressures, especially if the response
of oil-producing nations to supply disruptions from geopolitical tensions is not adequate. the
recent excise duty cuts on petrol and diesel will moderate retail inflation. thirdly, volatility in
global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. fourthly, a
sharp rise in input costs, combined with rising pricing power, poses the risk of higher passthrough to retail prices for both goods and services. firms covered under the reserve bank’s
industrial outlook survey report firming of input costs in q2:2018-19 and q3. however, global
commodity prices other than oil have moderated, which should mitigate the adverse
influence on input costs. fifthly, should there be fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state
levels, it will have a bearing on the inflation outlook, besides heightening market volatility and
crowding out private sector investment. finally, the staggered impact of hra revision by the
state governments may push up headline inflation. while the mpc will look through the
statistical impact of hra revisions, there is need to be watchful for any second-round effects
on inflation. the inflation outlook calls for a close vigil over the next few months, especially
because the output gap has virtually closed and several upside risks persist.
21.
against this backdrop, the mpc decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged. the
mpc reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4
per cent on a durable basis.
22.
the mpc notes that global headwinds in the form of escalating trade tensions,
volatile and rising oil prices, and tightening of global financial conditions pose substantial
risks to the growth and inflation outlook. it is, therefore, imperative to further strengthen
domestic macroeconomic fundamentals.
