resolution of the monetary policy committee (mpc)
april 5-7, 2021
on the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic
situation, the monetary policy committee (mpc) at its meeting today (april 7, 2021)
decided to:
•

keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (laf) unchanged
at 4.0 per cent.

consequently, the reverse repo rate under the laf remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent
and the marginal standing facility (msf) rate and the bank rate at 4.25 per cent.
•

the mpc also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as
necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the
impact of covid-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains
within the target going forward.

these decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term
target for consumer price index (cpi) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per
cent, while supporting growth.
the main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below.
assessment
global economy
2.

since the mpc’s meeting in february, lingering effects of the slowdown in the

global economy in q4 of 2020 have persisted, although recent arrivals of high frequency
indicators suggest that a gradual but uneven recovery may be forming. the much
anticipated boost to economic activity from the vaccination rollouts is being somewhat

2
held back by new mutations of covid-19, second and third waves of infections across
countries and unequal access to vaccines more generally. world trade activity improved
in q4:2020 and january 2021. there are, however, concerns due to covid-19-related
fresh lockdowns and depressed demand in a few major economies, escalation in
shipping charges and container shortages. inflation remains benign in major advanced
economies (aes), although highly accommodative monetary policies and large fiscal
stimuli have added to concerns around market-based indicators of inflation expectations,
unsettling bond markets globally. in a few emerging market economies (emes), however,
inflation is ruling above targets, primarily driven by firming global commodity prices. this
has even prompted a few of them to raise policy rates. equity and currency markets have
been turbulent with the increase in long-term bond yields and the steepening of yield
curves. more recently, however, calm has returned and major equity markets have
scaled new peaks in march, while currencies are trading mixed against a generally
firming us dollar. with the bond markets sell-offs, eme assets came under selling
pressure and capital outflows imposed depreciating pressures on eme currencies in
march.
domestic economy
3.

the second advance estimates for 2020-21 released by the national statistical

office (nso) on february 26, 2021 placed india’s real gross domestic product (gdp)
contraction at 8.0 per cent during the year. high frequency indicators – vehicle sales;
railway freight traffic; toll collections; goods and services tax (gst) revenues; e-way bills;
and steel consumption – suggest that gains in manufacturing and services activity in
q3:2020-21 extended into q4. purchasing managers’ index (pmi) manufacturing at 55.4
in march 2021 remained in expansion zone, but lower than its level in february. the
index of industrial production slipped into marginal contraction in january 2021, dragged
down by manufacturing and mining. core industries also contracted in february. the
resilience of agriculture is evident from foodgrains and horticulture production for 202021, which are expected to be 2.0 per cent and 1.8 per cent higher respectively than the
final estimates of 2019-20.
4.

headline inflation increased to 5.0 per cent in february after having eased to 4.1

per cent in january 2021. within an overall food inflation print of 4.3 per cent in february,
five out of twelve food sub-groups recorded double digit inflation. while fuel inflation
pressures eased somewhat in february, core inflation registered a generalised hardening
and increased by 50 basis points to touch 6 per cent.

5.

system liquidity remained in large surplus in february and march 2021 with

average daily net liquidity absorption of ₹5.9 lakh crore. driven by currency demand,
reserve money (rm) increased by 14.2 per cent (y-o-y) as on march 26, 2021. money
supply (m3) grew by 11.8 per cent as on march 26, 2021 with credit growth at 5.6 per
cent. corporate bond issuances at ₹6.8 lakh crore during 2020-21 (up to february 2021)
were higher than ₹6.1 lakh crore during the same period last year. issuances of
commercial paper (cps) turned around since december 2020 and were higher by 10.4
per cent during december 2020 to march 2021 than in the same period of the previous
year. india’s foreign exchange reserves increased by us$ 99.2 billion during 2020-21 to
us$ 577.0 billion at end-march 2021, providing an import cover of 18.4 months and 102
per cent of india’s external debt.
outlook
6.

the evolving cpi inflation trajectory is likely to be subjected to both upside and

downside pressures. the bumper foodgrains production in 2020-21 should sustain
softening of cereal prices going forward. while the prices of pulses, particularly tur and
urad, remain elevated, the incoming rabi harvest arrivals in the markets and the overall
increase in domestic production in 2020-21 should augment supply which, along with
imports, should enable some softening of these prices going forward. while edible oils
inflation has been ruling at heightened levels with international prices remaining firm,
reduction of import duties and appropriate incentives to enhance productivity
domestically could work towards a better demand-supply balance over the medium-term.
pump prices of petroleum products have remained high. reduction of excise duties and
cesses and state level taxes could provide some relief to consumers on top of the recent
easing of international crude prices. this could slow down the propagation of secondround effects. the impact of high international commodity prices and increased logistics
costs are being felt across manufacturing and services. finally, inflation expectations of
urban households one year ahead showed a marginal increase than over the three
months ahead horizon according to the reserve bank’s march 2021 survey. taking into
consideration all these factors, cpi inflation is now projected as 5.0 per cent in q4:202021; 5.2 per cent in q1:2021-22, 5.2 per cent in q2, 4.4 per cent in q3 and 5.1 per cent in
q4, with risks broadly balanced (chart 1).
7.

turning to the growth outlook, rural demand remains buoyant and record

agriculture production for 2020-21 bodes well for its resilience. urban demand has been
gaining strength on the back of normalisation of economic activity and should get a fillip
with the ongoing vaccination drive. the fiscal stimulus from increased allocation for

4
capital expenditure under the union budget 2021-22, expanded production-linked
incentives (pli) scheme and rising capacity utilisation (from 63.3 per cent in q2 to 66.6
per cent in q3:2020-21) should provide strong support to investment demand and
exports. firms engaged in manufacturing, services and infrastructure polled by the
reserve bank in march 2021 were optimistic about a pick-up in demand and expansion
in business activity into 2021-22. consumer confidence, on the other hand, has dipped
with the recent surge in covid infections in some states imparting uncertainty to the
outlook. taking these factors into consideration, the projection of real gdp growth for
2021-22 is retained at 10.5 per cent consisting of 26.2 per cent in q1, 8.3 per cent in q2,
5.4 per cent in q3 and 6.2 per cent in q4 (chart 2).

8.

the mpc notes that the supply side pressures on inflation could persist. it also

notes that demand-side pull remains moderate. while cost-push pressures have risen,
they could be partially offset with the normalisation of global supply chains. on imported
inflation from global commodity prices, urgent concerted and coordinated policy actions
by centre and states can mitigate domestic input costs such as taxes on petrol and
diesel and high retail margins. the renewed jump in covid-19 infections in certain parts
of the country and the associated localised lockdowns could dampen the demand for
contact-intensive services, restrain growth impulses and prolong the return to normalcy.
in such an environment, continued policy support remains necessary. taking these
developments into consideration, the mpc decided to continue with the accommodative
stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to
mitigate the impact of covid-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains
within the target going forward.
