first quarter review of monetary policy 2012-13
by
dr. d. subbarao
governor
introduction

account deficit (cad) and fiscal deficit,
pose significant risks to macroeconomic
stability. against this backdrop of
heightened global uncertainty and
domestic macroeconomic pressures, the
challenge for monetary policy is to
maintain its priority of containing
inflation and lowering inflation
expectations. at the same time, monetary
policy has also to be sensitive to risks to
growth and financial stability.

since the monetary policy
statement for 2012-13 in april 2012,
macroeconomic conditions have
deteriorated. much of the global economy
is in a synchronised slowdown, having
lost the upward momentum seen in the
early months of the year. despite the
slowing global economy, the outlook for
commodity prices is uncertain. the
situation in the euro area continues to
cause concern even as the prospects of
immediate default have been averted.
while exports of emerging and
developing economies (edes) have been
dented by the weak global economic
activity, capital flows into them have
declined markedly because of the strains
in the euro area financial market
conditions.

3.
in the above context, this
statement should be read and understood
together with the detailed review in
m a c ro e c o n o m i c a n d m o n e t a r y
developments released yesterday by the
reserve bank.
4.
this statement is organised in
four sections: section i provides an
overview of global and domestic
macroeconomic developments. section
ii sets out the outlook and projections for
growth, inflation and monetary
aggregates. section iii explains the stance
of monetary policy. section iv specifies
the monetary and liquidity measures.

2.
domestically, the macroeconomic
situation continues to raise concerns.
while growth has slowed down
significantly, inflation remains well
above the comfort zone of the reserve
bank. the large twin deficits, viz. current

1

i. the state of the economy
global economy

inter-linked, fiscal and financial stability
pressures in the euro area remain the
most significant source of systemic
global risk. in recent weeks, renewed
concerns about greece and the need for
greater collective support to spain and
italy have amplified these risks.
consequently, the potential for negative
spillovers to the euro area core countries
and to the rest of the world have also
increased.

5.
the global economy is slowing
down. in its latest update of the world
economic outlook (weo), the
international monetary fund (imf) has
revised its projection for global growth
in 2012 marginally downwards to 3.5 per
cent, but has emphasised further
downside risks to growth. in the us,
output growth decelerated to 1.5 per cent
(seasonally adjusted annualised rate) in
q2 from 2.0 per cent in q1 of 2012. in
the euro area, growth was flat in q1 after
a contraction by 1.2 per cent in the
previous quarter. in the uk, growth
contracted by 2.8 per cent in q2 of 2012
and 1.3 per cent in q1. output in japan
expanded by 4.7 per cent in q1 after a
low growth of 0.1 per cent in the previous
quarter, supported by reconstruction
related demand. the global manufacturing
purchasing managers’ index (pmi) fell
below the neutral level of 50.0 to 48.9 in
june 2012 - the lowest in 3 years suggesting contraction in manufacturing
a c t i v i t y. t h e g l o b a l c o m p o s i t e
(manufacturing and services) pmi at
50.3 in june 2012 suggests near
stagnation.

7.
importantly, risks to global
growth, which stem from persistent
weakness in advanced economies, have
increased with edes also exhibiting
moderation in growth. among the
brics countries, growth in china fell
from 8.1 per cent in q1 of 2012 to 7.6
per cent in q2. growth also moderated
significantly in brazil and south africa
in q1. according to the imf, growth in
a number of major edes turned out to
be lower than forecast by it earlier.
8.
inflationary pressures softened
a c r o s s a d v a n c e d a n d e m e rg i n g
economies, reflecting both weaker
growth prospects and moderation in
commodity prices. international (brent)
crude oil prices declined from an average
of about us$ 125 per barrel in march
2012 to an average of about us$ 95
per barrel in june 2012. in july, however,
the average price increased to above
us$ 100 per barrel. in advanced

commission (ec) summit on july 2,

recovery in growth or moderation in

5.7 per cent registered in the
corresponding period of last year. the
pmi rose marginally to 55.0 in june 2012
from 54.8 in may. the composite

rose to 55.7 in june from 55.3 in may.

economies, spare capacity in both
product and labour markets limits risks
to core inflation. among the brics
countries, inflation fell significantly in
china and russia. it also eased in brazil
and south africa. even as growth in
india is slowing, it is clearly an outlier
insofar as inflation is concerned.

12.
during the ongoing monsoon
season, rainfall up to july 25, 2012 was
22 per cent below its long period average
(lpa). the reserve bank’s production
weighted rainfall index (pwri) showed
an even higher deficit of 24 per cent.
further, the distribution of rainfall was
very uneven, with the north-west region
registering the highest deficit of about 39
per cent of lpa. if the rainfall deficiency
persists, agricultural production could be
adversely impacted.

domestic economy
9.
gross domestic product (gdp)
growth decelerated over four successive
quarters from 9.2 per cent in q4 of
2010-11 to 5.3 per cent in q4 of
2011-12. significant slowdown in
industrial growth as well as deceleration
in services sector activity pulled down
the overall gdp growth to 6.5 per cent
for 2011-12, below the reserve bank’s
baseline projection of 7 per cent.
10.
on the expenditure side,
significant weakness in investment
activity was the main cause of the
slowdown. gross fixed capital formation,
which grew by 14.7 per cent in q1 of
2011-12, moderated to 5.0 per cent in q2
and then contracted by 0.3 per cent in q3
before recovering to a growth of 3.6 per
cent in q4. growth in private consumption
also decelerated in 2011-12, even as it
remained the key driver of growth. the
positive impact of the rupee depreciation
on exports is yet to be seen.

13.
capacity utilisation levels in q4
of 2011-12 as reflected in the results of
the reserve bank’s order book,
inventories and capacity utilisation
survey (obicus) revealed the usual
seasonal improvement over the previous
quarter. however, lead information from
the reserve bank’s industrial outlook
survey (ios) indicates that capacity
utilisation dropped in q1 and q2 of
2012-13. moreover, overall business
sentiment also moderated in both the
quarters.

11.
growth in the index of industrial
production (iip) decelerated from 8.2 per
cent in 2010-11 to 2.9 per cent in
2011-12. further, iip growth during
april-may 2012, at 0.8 per cent, was

weights of commodities, especially of
food items in the two indices. second,
even in respect of similar items, inflation
was higher in cpi than in wpi, suggesting
that besides the incidence of higher
service taxes, moderation in non-food
manufactured products prices has not yet
been transmitted to the retail level. the
rate of increase in the prices of services,
which is included in cpi but not in wpi,
was also high.

the stickiness in inflation, despite the
significant growth slowdown, was
largely on account of high primary food
inflation, which was in double-digits
during q1 of 2012-13 due to an unusual
spike in vegetable prices and sustained
high inflation in protein items.
15.
fuel group inflation moderated
from 12.1 per cent in april 2012 to 11.5
per cent in may and further to 10.3 per
cent in june on account of decrease in
non-administered fuel prices, which in
turn was due to decline in global crude
oil prices. however, the reversal in crude
oil prices in recent weeks may add to
domestic inflationary pressure.

18.
among other factors, urban
households’ inflation expectations, as per
the latest survey conducted by the
reserve bank, increased slightly in q1
of 2012-13 after a decline in the previous
q u a r t e r. n o t w i t h s t a n d i n g s o m e
moderation, wage inflation in rural and
urban areas remains relatively high.

16.
non-food manufactured products
inflation was at 4.8 per cent in may and
june 2012. the momentum indicator of
non-food manufactured products
inflation (seasonally adjusted 3-month
moving average annualised inflation
rate), however, showed an upturn.
moreover, input price pressures persist
due to both exchange rate movements
and supply side constraints. going
forward, further pressure on non-food
manufactured products inflation cannot
be ruled out.

19.
an analysis of corporate
performance in 2011-12, based on a
common sample of 2,273 nongovernment non-financial companies,
indicates that the sales growth remained
positive for the year even after adjusting
for inflation. however, earnings
decelerated due to an increase in
expenditure, indicating decline in pricing
power. early results for q1 of 2012-13
suggest that pricing power remained
subdued.

17.
the consumer price index (cpi
new series) inflation remained in doubledigits in q1 of 2012-13, driven by both
food and non-food prices. the divergence
between wpi and cpi inflation was on
account of two factors. first, there are
differences in the composition and

20.
while the money supply (m3)
growth, at 14.3 per cent in mid-july, was
marginally lower than the indicative
trajectory of 15 per cent, non-food credit
growth at 17.4 per cent was slightly
above the indicative projection of 17 per

conditions was due to a decline in
government cash balances with the
reserve bank, injection of liquidity of
about `860 billion by way of open
market operation (omo) purchases of
securities and increased use of the export
credit refinance facility by banks after
the increase in the limit effected in the
june mid-quarter review. reflecting the
improvement in the liquidity situation,
the weighted average call money rate,
which is the operating target of the
reserve bank, stayed close to the policy
repo rate.

cent. if we include banks’ investment in
commercial paper and other instruments,
non-food credit growth was even higher
at 17.7 per cent.
21.
the flow of resources to the
commercial sector, from both bank and
non-bank sources, increased to `1.9
trillion in 2012-13 so far (up to july 13,
2012) as compared with `1.4 trillion
during the corresponding period of last
year. amongst non-bank sources,
resources raised through commercial
paper increased significantly.
22.
following the reduction in the
repo rate in april, several commercial
banks reduced their lending rates. the
modal base rate of scheduled commercial
banks (scbs) declined by 25 bps to
10.50 per cent during april-june 2012.
significantly, on the basis of the weighted
average lending rate (walr) of
commercial banks, adjusted for inflation,
real rates are now lower than they were
during the high growth five-year period
of 2003-08. banks’ actions on deposit
rates, however, were muted due to the
slowdown in deposit growth.

24.
during q1 of 2012-13, yields on
government securities softened reflecting
an improvement in liquidity, moderation
in inflation and concerns about weakening
of domestic and global growth. the
10-year benchmark yield was
significantly lower at 8.11 per cent on
july 26, 2012 as compared with 8.63 per
cent at end-march 2012.
25.
housing prices continued to rise
despite the decline in volume of
transactions. the reserve bank’s
quarterly housing price index suggests
that prices increased in q4 of 2011-12 in
most of the 9 cities for which the index
is compiled.

23.
liquidity conditions have eased
considerably since the april policy. the
average daily net borrowing under the
liquidity adjustment facility (laf),
which was 2.2 per cent of average net
demand and time liabilities (ndtl) in
q4 of 2011-12, declined sharply to 1.3
per cent in q1 of 2012-13 and further to
0.7 per cent in july 2012 (up to july 26,
2012). the turnaround in liquidity

food subsidies were lower, fertiliser
subsidies were more than twice the
previous year’s level. clearly, if the

subsidies to under 2 per cent of gdp in
2012-13, as set out in the union budget,

data, services exports rose moderately by
3 per cent to us$ 35 billion, while
services imports surged by 19 per cent
to us$ 21 billion in q1. accordingly, net
services exports of us$ 14 billion in q1
of 2012-13 were lower by 12 per cent as
compared with q1 of 2011-12.

is to be achieved, immediate action on
fuel and fertiliser subsidies will be
required.
27.
in 2011-12, the cad rose to
us$ 78 billion (4.2 per cent of gdp)
from us$ 46 billion (2.7 per cent of
gdp) in the previous year, largely
reflecting a higher trade deficit on
account of subdued external demand and
relatively inelastic imports of petroleum,
oil and lubricants (pol) as well as gold
and silver. as capital inflows fell short
of the cad, there was a net drawdown
of reserves (on a bop basis) to the extent
of us$ 13 billion in contrast to a net
accretion to reserves of more or less of
the same order in the previous year.

29.
during 2012-13 so far (july 20,
2012), the 6-, 30- and 36-currency trade
weighted real effective exchange rates
(reer) depreciated in the range of 7-10
per cent, primarily reflecting the nominal
depreciation of the rupee against the us
dollar by around 9 per cent. the
depreciation was mainly on account of
the slowdown in capital inflows, the large
current account deficit, domestic
economic uncertainty and growing
apprehensions about the euro area
problem.

28.
reflecting the fragile global
situation, india’s merchandise exports
declined by 1.7 per cent to us$ 75 billion
during q1 of 2012-13. however, imports
declined even more sharply, by 6.1 per
cent, to us$ 115 billions led by a decline
in imports of non-oil non-gold
commodities. as a result, the trade deficit
was lower at us$ 40 billion in q1 of
2012-13 as compared with us$ 46
billion in the corresponding period of the

30.
exchange rate depreciation in q1
of 2012-13 was not specific to india;
most ede currencies also depreciated.
however, among the edes with large
current account deficits, the depreciation
of the indian rupee was relatively large,
reflecting moderation in capital inflows.

ii. domestic outlook and projections
growth

in industrial activity. both theses
assumptions did not hold. the monsoon
has been deficient and uneven so far.
also, data on industrial production for
april-may suggest that industrial

in the april policy, the reserve
bank had projected gdp growth for
2012-13 at 7.3 per cent on the assumption
of a normal monsoon and improvement

on the basis of the above considerations,
the growth projection for 2012-13 is
revised downwards from 7.3 per cent to
6.5 per cent (chart 1).

activity, despite some recovery, remains
weak. in addition, several risks to
domestic growth have intensified. first,
global growth and trade volume are now
expected to be lower than projected
earlier. given the greater integration of
the indian economy with the global
economy, this will have an adverse
impact on growth, particularly in industry
and the services sector. however, the
lagged impact of depreciation of the
exchange rate could partly offset this.
the impending “fiscal cliff” in the us in
2013, when temporary tax concessions
expire and automatic spending cuts take
effect, also entails additional risks to the
growth outlook. second, reflecting the
lagged impact of weak industrial activity
and global slowdown, the services sector
growth is also expected to slow down.

inflation
32.
in the april policy, the reserve
bank made a baseline projection of wpi
inflation for march 2013 of 6.5 per cent.
this was based, in part, on an assumption
of normal monsoon. the deficient and
uneven monsoon performance so far
will have an adverse impact on food
inflation. notwithstanding some
moderation, international crude oil
prices remain elevated. this, coupled
with the pass- thr ough of r upee
depreciation to import prices, continues
to put upward pressure on domestic fuel
price inflation. in addition, with the
adjustment of domestic prices of
7

34.
although inflation has remained
persistently high over the past two years,
it averaged around 5.5 per cent during
the 2000s, both in terms of wpi and cpi,
down from its earlier trend rate of about
7.5 per cent. given this record, the
conduct of monetary policy will continue
to condition and contain perception of
inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent.
this is in line with the medium-term
objective of 3.0 per cent inflation
consistent with india’s broader integration
into the global economy.

petroleum products to international price
changes still incomplete, embedded risks
of suppressed inflation could also impact
fuel prices in india going forward. the
decline in non-food manufactured
products inflation has not been
commensurate with the moderation in
growth. input price pressures on account
of exchange rate movements and
infrastructural bottlenecks in coal,
minerals and power may exert upside
pressure on non-food manufactured
products inflation.
33.
keeping in view the recent trends
in food inflation, trends in global
commodity prices and the likely demand
scenario, the baseline projection for wpi
inflation for march 2013 is now raised
from 6.5 per cent, as set out in the april
policy, to 7.0 per cent (chart 2).

monetary aggregates
35.
with nominal growth remaining
broadly at the level envisaged in the
april policy, monetary aggregates are
expected to move along the trajectories
projected in the monetary policy

adversities in several parts of the
world, the outlook for food and
commodity prices, especially crude
oil, has turned uncertain. these
developments have adverse
implications for domestic growth
and inflation.

statement 2012-13. accordingly, m3
growth projection for 2012-13 has been
retained at 15 per cent and the growth
in non-food credit of scbs at 17 per
cent. as always, these numbers are
indicative projections and not targets.
risk factors

iii) while inflation in protein items
remains elevated due to structural
demand supply imbalances,
additional risks to food inflation
have emerged from the deficient and
uneven monsoon. this has the
potential of aggravating inflation
and inflation expectations.

36.
the projections of growth and
inflation for 2012-13 are subject to a
number of risks as indicated below:
i)

ii)

external risks to the outlook for the
indian economy are intensifying.
adverse feedback loops between
sovereign and financial market
stress in the euro area are resulting
in increased risk aversion, financial
market volatility, and perverse
movements in capital flows. with
the deteriorating macroeconomic
situation in the euro area interacting
with a loss of growth momentum
in the us and in edes, the risks of
potentially large negative spillovers
have increased. india’s growth
prospects too will be hurt by this.

iv) at current levels of the cad and
the fiscal deficit, the indian economy
faces the “twin deficit” risk.
financing the latter from domestic
saving crowds out private
investment, thus lowering growth
prospects. this, in turn, deters
capital inflows, making it more
difficult to finance the former.
failure to narrow twin deficits with
appropriate policy actions threatens
both macroeconomic stability and
growth sustainability.

reflecting the setback to the global
recovery as also weather-related

iii. the policy stance
37.
keeping in view the slowdown
in growth, the reserve bank frontloaded the policy rate reduction in april
with a cut of 50 basis points. subsequent

developments suggested that even as
growth moderated, inflation remained
sticky. keeping in view the heightening
risks to inflation, the reserve bank

implications. in this context, investment
activity has remained subdued over the
last two years. external demand has also
remained weak due to the slowdown in
global growth. consequently, the post
crisis trend rate of growth, which was
earlier estimated at 8.0 per cent, has
dropped to 7.5 per cent. while the current
rate of growth is clearly lower than trend,
the output gap will remain relatively
small. under these conditions, demand
pressures on inflation can re-emerge
quite quickly, exacerbating the existing
supply pressures.

decided to pause in the mid-quarter
review (mqr) of june 2012, even in
the face of slowing growth.
38.
against the backdrop of global
and domestic macroeconomic conditions,
outlook and risks, the policy stance in
this review is shaped by three major
considerations.
39.
first, after moderating for a short
period during december-january,
headline wpi inflation edged up again
beginning february 2012 and has
remained sticky, above 7 per cent, on
account of increase in food prices,
increase in input costs, and upward
revision in prices of some administered
items such as coal. headline inflation has
persisted even as demand has moderated
and the pricing power of corporates
weakened. non-food manufactured
products inflation has also not declined
to the extent warranted by the growth
moderation. this reflects severe supply
constraints and entrenchment of inflation
expectations.

41.
third, liquidity conditions play
an important role in the transmission of
monetary policy signals. although the
situation has eased significantly in the
recent period, it is necessary to ensure
that liquidity pressures do not constrain
the flow of credit to productive sectors
of the economy.
42.
against this backdrop, the stance
of monetary policy is intended to:

40.
second, growth decelerated
significantly to 6.5 per cent in 2011-12.
although more recent data suggest some
pick up, overall economic activity
remains subdued. importantly, the
current growth performance has to be
seen in reference to the trend rate of
growth in order to assess its inflationary

expectations;

•

over the medium-term; and

•

continue to provide liquidity to

productive sectors.

iv. monetary and liquidity measures
guidance

43.
on the basis of the current
assessment and in line with the policy
stance outlined in section iii, the
reserve bank announces the following
policy measures.

50.
the primary focus of monetary
policy remains inflation control in order
to secure a sustainable growth path over
the medium-term. while monetary
actions over the past two years may have
contributed to the growth slowdown – an
unavoidable consequence – several other
factors have played a significant role. in
the current circumstances, lowering
policy rates will only aggravate
inflationary impulses without necessarily
stimulating growth. as the multiple
constraints to growth are addressed, the
reserve bank will stand ready to act
appropriately.

repo rate
44.
it has been decided to retain the
repo rate under the liquidity adjustment
facility (laf) at 8.0 per cent.
reverse repo rate
45.
the reverse repo rate under the
laf, determined with a spread of 100
basis points below the repo rate, stands
at 7.0 per cent.
marginal standing facility (msf)
rate
46.
the msf rate, determined with a
spread of 100 basis points above the repo
rate, stands at 9.0 per cent.

51.
meanwhile, managing liquidity
within the comfort zone remains an
objective and the reserve bank will
respond to liquidity pressures, including
by way of omos.

bank rate
47.
the bank rate stands at 9.0
per cent.
cash reserve ratio

52.
in a turbulent global environment,
the risks of external shocks are high and
the reserve bank stands ready to respond
to any such shocks swiftly, using all
available instruments.

48.
the cash reserve ratio (crr) of
scheduled banks has been retained at
4.75 per cent of their net demand and
time liabilities (ndtl).
